I appologize to those of you who downloaded the older version, but because this was for a contest, I was forced to submit a map by the deadline.   Sorry again for this.  \r\n\r\nAnd thank you to all of you who have left positive feedback so far!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a map I built for the Interlopers ZM Mapping Contest.  It is somewhat similar to zm_lila_panic, by Lila, so I have named it zm_panic for now.  It contains an open outdoor area, with a single chokepoint leading to an underground subway.  \r\n\r\nThis map was made in about two weeks, so its not as polished as I would have hoped, but it still turned out good I think.  The map plays best with a large number of people (24-32).  Enjoy!"

For this one I went to the actual house with a laptop and set about making this version the most accurate version yet.  Now the upstairs is much more realistic, the first floor is next to perfect, and even the basement approaches reality.  There are still fake areas and the map isn't 100%, but I don't have a blueprint, so sue me.  I also made a ton of custom map props such as mirrors so that the map would seem as real as possible.  There are also many new textures and decals to add to the feel.  I also extended the underground lab and added a new secret there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's about it.  If you like some of the stuff in the map such as custom props or texture, I have released a number of them already in the prefabs section, but if you want something you can't find, feel free to pakrat the map to get it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, Questions & Comments are appreciated.\r\n- NatalyaAF -</font>"

This version is mostly scenery changes, but I also added an underground lab area and extended the area around the house for you to play on, though it's still mostly field.  I also added 1 new secret, and made the house look more like the actual house.  I also added a TV antenna tower that they have at the back.  You can climb it as a ladder to get to the roof.  All old secrets stayed the same except the hard one under the deck.

It's a 2-story house with a basement, garage, and tiny play house.  The map is based off of my cousin's house in Onadega, Ontario.  The first floor is almost 100% accurate, but the second floor has some rooms merged, and the basement is completely original, except the staircase and door to the outside.  The house also has too many windows.  O well, it's a game right?  Anyway, the map does have a bunch of secrets like all my maps.  Some are easy, a couple are hard.  (Invisible buttons & stuff...)\r\n\r\nThis map was made small so that when there are only a few people on a server, it doesn't take forever to find them, but when there are a lot there is a decent spot for everyone.\r\n\r\nThanks to MoOnLiGht for testing this map on the Zombie Network II server:\r\n81.95.0.26:27035  (Unlimited Ammo, No Reload, Prop Menu)\r\n\r\nAll custom materials are paked into the map, including the radar.  Let me know if you have texture missing bugs, but I don't think there will be any.  Tell me what you guys think!!\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nMinor note regarding the flag and symbols on the house:\r\nMy extended family is Latvian, and that's the flag of Latvia.  The wooden symbol is something they'll put on their houses, but I don't know what it means or signifies, just that my cousins have one on their house, so I put it up too.</font>"

I decided to use the teleport idea because i thought it will help cut down the ammount of spawn camping that goes on in Zombie Mod, people will proberly say \" Then they will just camp at the teleport exits\" the teleport exits are in open space so if a zombie is camping there he will be getting blown to bits by people on roofs, on cars, vans and peopel inside rooms, so the zombies will not be able to just stand there and camp they will be forced to move.\r\n\r\nThere are in total 26 CT spawns and 26 t spawns, i put this many in so different servers can use it.
