This is far and away the best temple map that I have seen in existence and I am proud to be its creator.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of de_arcis is truly unique. If I were to write a background story for this map it would run something like this:\r\n\r\n\"On January 3, 2008, a satelite owned by a private corporation in Southern California tracking an abnormally large sandstorm discovered what appeared to be the ruins of a stone structure in the midst of the Khadarin Desert on the ancient road that once joined Eastern Magpyr and the trading port at Khapor. Analysts caught their first glimpse of the structure when they noticed the sun reflecting off of an object that might be a metal dome. Word got out about the discovery and a small sect of Dangal Elitists, the radical group likely responsible for the Cairo Central Bank Bombings earlier this month, claimed that the coordinates of the discovery closely correspond to the location of the the Great Temple of Arcis, which was recorded by their own ancient writings as having been buried in an unprecedented sandstorm around 150 BC. The Dangals immediately dispatched a militant task force to take control of the temple and were the first to step inside. Seven local governments staked joint claim to the ruins and, expecting resistance, dispatched an elite unit comprised of counter-terrorist components from agencies of all seven countries. A confrontation is inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nde_arcis is an elemental temple representing the 4 elements, earth, fire, water, and air. The earth and water altars are bombsites. The air altar when jumped on will lift you up to a sniper loft (if you are skilled enough to figure out how it works). The fire altar and statue room are the main confrontation points. As far as I know the map has no CT/T leaning- it should be perfectly balanced with 3 obvious exits from CT and 3 obvious exits from T.  The map as you can tell is asymetrical and multi-leveled, quite an accomplishment for a well balanced map. \r\n\r\n"

Terrorists have to bomb one of two valuable spots to win.\r\n\r\nThe map features both outside and underground spots, 2 sniping ranges, a lot of close-combat spots and very quick and intense rounds. Two bomb sites are available: (A) One in an underground tunnel where precious vases and crates of uncalculable price lay still unopened by archeologists who fled the region because of terrorist threats, or (B) an open archeology field where discovery of precious artifacts is imminent in a marked ground section.\r\n\r\n*NOTE!* This map was made for Counter-Strike (1.6) but I modified it so it will now only work for CS:Source. The architecture is very simple, so bear with it. I am currently fixing some minor issues with the map, but it's already 100% completed.

Someone in his school doesn't like him and decides to destroy his antfarm. Hearing this news vivi rushes to get his friends AND PROTECT WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY HIS!!. \r\n- this epic battle takes place in two settings 1. the antfarm - you start in the ant farm and work your way out to grow to normal size. 2. the Lab - you play as a big peron here and the ant farms are located on the tables.\r\n\r\n----- why I made the map-----\r\n\r\nI made this map for 1.6 and i decided to bring it back with a lil spice. Once i finished this map i realized i want to make a map pack of small to big maps. I have already made De_sony-psp and im going to make another. (hint fish bowl hint) so enjoy my map everyone i spent a good deal working on the textures and the floor tiles are custom. remodled after my schools. \r\n\r\n-----Special thanks--------\r\n\r\nEveryone who beta tested and nba1314 for sugesting another bombsite.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!!!!\r\n\r\n--Other maps made by Generalvivi--\r\nawp_subzero\r\nfy_caution-tape\r\nDe_sony-psp\r\n**soon** de_graveyard\r\n**soon** awp_subzero-real\r\n\r\n---- OTHER NOTES------"
