I did add nodes to the map I was working with, but it just wasn't enough. The NPC's have problems with leaving the spawn - they keep jumping about. Usually, sooner or later all of them finally get out, but I added a Spawnkill button in the mansion (originally for the AFK's but it works for stuck NPC's too ;>) so you shouldn't have real problems, unless all players die...\r\n\r\nFEATURES:  Thinking about DM servers, I made people unable to return to their spawn after they get out. Usually this also makes it unable to kill AFKs on non-DM servers, so I made a spawnkill button on the desk in the mansion. You can only press it once.\r\n\r\n           There are 3 encounter spots in the map (by encounter spots, I mean the places where the two teams are supposed to meet). One is inside the mansion, one is on the mansion roof, and one is outside the mansion, in the front garden. Whichever team wins over 1 encounter spot will have a big advantage. Eg. If you take over the roof, you can shoot the inside and the garden from above. You can also break the big glass, and jump down into the mansion.\r\n\r\n           There is a health regeneration spot under the desk. It regenerates 3hp per second, but leaves you very vurnerable to enemies. The barrier is also on the height of your line of vision when crouching, so when you're regenerating, anyone could just crouch and sneak up to you without you even noticing.\r\n\r\nNOTES:     If you wish to edit this map in any way, ASK ME FIRST. Contact me through steam. My nickname is grzesiek580"

Because your opposite team most likely have [UK]Snipers among them. And they will be waiting for YOU to show up so they can (suprise sidney) kill you or (If they miss) tell your position to their friends. AND YEAH even that TERMINATOR69 and hes buddy fuck7ard_666_mp3 will have advantage if they know where you and your buddy's are hiding!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>GAMEPLAY: There is simple paths you can follow and it takes time to go from spawn point to another so i bet the map is somewhere between medium-large size. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>And next step!

I actually started making this map on the 13th of March in 2011, however, I dicided to finish it for the \"Junkyard\" contest. I have made many visual changes so it would fit the requirements for the contest. It is an abandoned Soviet factory building somewhere in the wastelands of Russia with an additional Junkyard surrounding the compound. Mostly old rusty cars end up here except for a few bigger trucks. Many years the place has been left to the nature to take it back, but now police and special forces are supposed to fight terrorism in an undisturbed place, being on their own.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n==================\r\nEquip your sniper rifles, you might want to use them. However, you can eventually get in close combat inside the factory with its many concrete blocks, or try to find a way around to attack the opposing force from behind. There are only few possibilties to hide in the outside place, you have to hurry.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n==================\r\nNote that this map has **NOT** been optimized yet! It is still in **beta**, but for now I am going for another project. I will update the map however some time.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n==================\r\nExtract the bsp-file from the zip folder into the directory\r\n\r\n**c:\\programs\\Steam\\steamapps\\[username]\\counter-strike\\source\\cstrike\\maps**\r\n\r\n(default Steam directory)\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n==================\r\n**Any feedback will be appreciated!** Tell me what you think of the Soviet style of the map and if it is a good idea to make the map that wide and\r\nopen.
