		"_sText": "<font color=\"royalblue\" face=\"helvetica\"><b>ze_retribution\r\n\r\n\r\nMap Statistics:</b>\r\n- 64 Spawns\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Radar Map\r\n- Custom Textures\r\n- Drivable Vehicles\r\n- Map Nuke\r\n- Multiple Escape Paths\r\n- 3 Safe Zones\r\n- Custom Sound\r\n- 3D Skybox\r\n- 1 Secret\r\n- .88 FlaK Gun\r\n- Traps\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Background:</b>\r\nAtixium wanted to make a sequel to his helicopter map of an escape through a city.  But he built it with driveable cars, so he wanted me to come and fix the cars for him so that he could release it.  Anyway, though the cars and theme showed some promise, the city was half-assed at best.  I therefore took it upon myself to build a whole new map where humans escape from a city in drivable vehicles, and then nuke the place to kill the zombies.  That's how this map was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Gameplay:</b>\r\nEveryone starts at one side of the map near one of two big Soviet KRAZ trucks.  There is also a Ford Mustang GT nearby which one player can drive.  Players can either hop in the trucks and car, or try to get to the nuke at the end of the tunnel by foot.  There are some traps on the way, most of which are in the tunnel itself.  Anyway, the trucks and mustangs (second mustang is locked behind a secret invisible wall) have to take the road all the way to the tunnel, but since they go fast I put in a shorter foot path through the city for everyone else.  Despite the shorter trip, the cars still manage to beat the walkers some of the time.  Anyway, you make your way to the bottom of the tunnel and towards the end of it and there's a door on the right...  Shoot it open and there is a Nuke launching button inside.  The Nuke takes 30 seconds, and will irradiate the map for 10 seconds.  Everyone not in a safe zone (the tunnel is NOT safe) will die.  The two other safe zones are a couple buildings near the tunnel...  Their doors lead to underground areas where you can wait for the nuke to pass.  I did multiple safe areas because the rounds are very short otherwise, lasting only about 2 minutes if someone hauls ass to the nuke.  Therefore, this is a hybrid camping//escape map.  The map disables respawn and the map sets the zombie timer to be very fast to keep it competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Map Objective:</b>\r\nI made this map to look good.  It's probably the best city map ever made for ZM in terms of detail and environment.  The gameplay is a little unorthodox so I don't know how it will fare in that respect, but it looks nice and that's what I was going for.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point I don't know what else to say, other than that I hope you like my map!!\r\n\r\n- NatalyaAF -</font>"

One makes defending easier, one makes attacking easier.\r\n\r\n- Admin room/Level Selection: Located behind the APC in the spawn area you can control the levels.\r\n\r\n- Particle Effects: These add much better visuals for the map (despite the pain they were to figure out!)\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n------------------\r\nIf anyone has the time, I would be very grateful to have as much feedback as I can get. Please feel free to critique the hell out of my map and leave the feedback in the comments below!\r\nThank-you and I hope you like Prototype!\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n------------------\r\n### B2\r\n- Fixed missing textures on helicopter\r\n- Fixed missing sounds\r\n### B3\r\n- Fixed balancing issues at end of Mission 1\r\n### B4\r\n- Reworked the teleporting system for AFK/losers who camp the beginning.

Much simpler design and should be playable w/o getting stuck.\r\n- Moved the level choosing system to another area due to shooting through walls causing problems. Admins can access it by noclipping behind the APC at spawn and going through the teleport.\r\n- Fixed the Color Correction not disabling at the end of Mission 2 when failing\r\n- Added a failure if zombies get too close to the final stand point in Mission 3 (prevents glitching into the \"win\" room if humans lose)\r\n### V2\r\n- Fixed the rock glitch that allowed you to skip to level 2\r\n\r\nOther ZE maps\r\n------------------\r\nGameshow_v1_2: http://csszm.gamebanana.com/maps/172357"

I loved the screaming in the end though, epic victory roar! :P</p>\r\n<p>2# Sg's second win was much better than the first one.\r\none zombie untill the spaceship, fewer zombies at the end. I liked the alien device\r\ntiming and the bossfight itself (some died but they managed to make it anyways). The alien timing was perfect. \r\nI laughed at the human who died by the alien, im such a bad person. this was SG's best win.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>SyndicateGamers</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1# I really liked sG's win. They had a decent amount of zombies from the beginning untill ZaN killed them all \r\nexcept 1 with the gauss rifle xD. The zombie defense seemed really easy during the bossfight. Im impressed that\r\nthey managed to kill the predator even though so many died during the fight. The alien device timing was really \r\ngood also. They few humans left held back the zombie from getting killed by the alien. They also managed to kill\r\nthe alien just in time (like SG's second win). The victory screaming was once again awesome.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>Zmcorp (WINNER)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1# I didn't like the first win at all, The alien should have killed the humans but it pushed them \r\ninside the wall instead. (same scenario as SG's first win) Also for some reason the recorder recorded a failround\r\nin the same demofile.</p>\r\n<p>2# (WINNING DEMO) This was a really good win actually. They had the most amount of zombies at the end and still won, they even \r\nmanaged to beat the predator without any alien device. Well they used the \"corner technique\". Alien timing\r\nwas really good, just like the others. This was their best win of all 4.</p>\r\n<p>3# This demo started right before the final bossevent (climbing towards the core). same amount of zombies as the \r\nsecond demo. The alien got even closer this time, due to the demo starting in the middle of the fight i cant judge\r\non much. This demo wont pass.</p>\r\n<p>4# I didn't like this win either, first of all they recorded 2 rounds again. Secondly most zombies didn't do anything\r\nduring the bossfight. About 70% of the zombies started to move once the zombie bridge activated. The alien lagged\r\n(same scenario as SG's first win) as they should have died.\r\nI wouldn't say that this demo have a bigger chance of winning at all. The 2nd one remains the best win for Zm Corp.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>Bor3dgaming</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1# bG's win was really good. Fair amount of humans/zombies. Good alien device timing, alien got killed fast and the\r\nteamspeak was great. There was slightly few zombies at the end though, most of them seemed to be far in the back.\r\nThe overall round was pretty decent, i approve.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>These are fast summaries of each demo, there is smaller detail that i haven't explained above.\r\nPlease accept the fact that you didn't win/get your name implemented in case you didn't.\r\nThe winning community may design their own \"plate\" for me to put in the map.\r\nI will put the playernames of the winning community in the map + a list of the communities who tried.\r\nI hope you all had a fun experience while playing. I dont think that i will make a challenge\r\nagain, but we cant know for sure.</p>\r\n<p>See you ingame!\r\n/Luffaren</p>\r\n<p><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em>_*</p>"

		"_sText": "Paranoid V11.5 > V11.9:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Antlion Guard and Giant Crab are now immune to speed changes; so freezing weapons, traps and labyrinth triggers have no effect on them; Antlion keeps being fast, Crab keeps being slow.\r\n    Giant Crab now automatically destroys projectiles of most weapons like those from the Annihilator, Rocket Launcher, Singularity Gun, Thundergun and Freezer.\r\n    Added new Coliseum Ending: Fight the Special Zombies. This will kill all normal zombies and allow you to fight the rest (from Zombie Jumpers to Balrogs and Titans, every zombie that picked a special knife).\r\n    Coliseum Mode “Fight the Titan” has been sightly changed. Now the zombies have 10 seconds to pick up the monster, when the time runs out every zombie will die but the one that picked the giant monster.\r\n    Reverse Mode has been reworked/improved. Now there are two new holds and you can walk into the portal area at the begging of the first labyrinth from the ground level.\r\n\r\n-------V11_5\r\nA LAG-free version, with many fixed bugs and important gameplay and difficulty balances. Enjoy it!\r\n\r\n-------V10_4\r\n- Many bugs fixed\r\n- Many things improved\r\n\r\n-------V10_1  ( -----------> FINAL VERSION OF PARANOID <----------- )\r\n- CRASH PROBLEM FIXED!!!\r\n- Adapted for new update!\r\n- Many weapons use the new particle system of the new source engine update!\r\n- New starting modes.\r\n- New monster (Pyramid Head)\r\n- New items (erendil light, the crowd, the wall carrier)\r\n- Huge list of changes (more than 100, I can't list all them)\r\n\r\nNo more versions will be re\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\nThis Reborn_V8 version won't be the last one. \r\nWe noticed a small list of bugs that will be fixed in a final version called ze_Paranoid_Reborn_Final. Will be the last version.\r\n\r\nALL Changes at Turbo v7 and v8\r\n\r\n----------V8:\r\n- Titan charge action\r\n- Zombie teleporter\r\n- Singularity Cannon\r\n- Ladder bearer\r\n- Fire and protection spirits\r\n- Lost smoke (like uber secret that you dudes won't discover never)\r\n- 1 new ending mode (Kill the Titan)\r\n- new starting mode: voluntary mode (humans choose if they are turned into zombies)\r\n- new starting mode: VIP mode (if the VIP die, everybody dies)\r\n- new starting mode: ultimate fighting at coliseum (all weapons, and all monsters and coliseum with unlimited ammo)\r\n- the Ghost from v1\r\nRead more on: : i3D.net Game Forums http://forum.i3d.net/showthread.php?t=104797\r\n- New 2º lab structure\r\n- New design of the 1º lab\r\n- New high trigger: hard core mode (floor doesn't fly at core, will be difficult to hold at core)\r\n- High secret: the architect room (control of the triggers of the map)\r\n- Some other things I can't remember\r\n\r\n----------V7:\r\n- Lag preventing at core\r\n- Balance fixes at many zones or moments\r\n- Trying to solve the crash problem\r\n- Some other things\r\n- Zombie boss speed glitch fixed\r\n- Reverse mode its easier and the !ztele glitch fixed\r\n\r\n- New starting mode: 3 sides only (this will focus the action at the half of the map, a mode with more zombie moments, works like random firstly).\r\n- New starting mode: 1 way mode (will be like a normal escape: it starts like massacre mode, the zombies spawn behind the humans, will be a fixed way with the random walls that will act like defending spots, you can pick some of the special weapons, and take another at core).\r\n- New starting mode: reverse Silent Hill (like reverse but with Silent Hill mode, spawn at corridoor->weird core->2º lab->1º lab->spawn)\r\n- New ending at coliseum: all weapons reward (if you choose this option, all weapons will be pickable at next round at spawn)\r\n- Improved bestial mode: all weapons will be teleported at spawn (17 weapons).\r\n- Improved No Barriers mode: non-stop until reach the core ball, the high speed for CT will be activated.\r\n- New item CT: wall controller (the picker can open and close the walls of 1º and 2º lab)\r\n- New item CT: Juggernaut (Dog model from HL2, the picker have like 4 or 5 more hits of HP, you can charge pressing the 2nd button (hurt and push)).\r\n- New item CT: Kamikaze (the picker that activates the item with 2nd button will burn in flames and die after 2 seconds with an explosion that hurts 5.000 to near zombies).\r\nRead more on: : i3D.net Game Forums http://forum.i3d.net/showthread.php?t=104797\r\n- New item T: zombie summoner (zombies can be able to teleport to the picker position with an extra teleport at zombie hall).\r\n- New item T: zombie stopper (the picker will modify his speed, preventing being pushed by nades or cancelling the freezer effect).\r\n- New item CT: slower (if the picker activate this item, an area will be activated, if zombies touch this area will be slowed, if they leave it, will return at his original speed. 20 s of duration, 30s of recharge).\r\n- New item CT: builder (the picker can build 15 pieces of barricade, with 150 of HP each one)\r\n- New item T: Titan (less pushback, the zombie can destroy breakable props or people in short range with 2nd mouse click, more HP, less speed, intimidating aspect (Gargantua model from HL:source)).\r\n\r\nChanges at Turbo v6_1:\r\n- Changed illumination\r\n- Fixed all bugs from Turbo v5\r\n- More balance\r\n- Improved the \"reverse mode\"\r\n- Gravity trigger removed\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges at Turbo v5:\r\nSpecial Weapons:\r\n\r\nNew Special Weapon: TurtleThrower.\r\n\tTurtleThrower info: Shoots with a ratio of 0.5/sec; max 2 turtles at the same time, turtles attach themselves to zombies hurting 200 dmg/sec. Damaging turtles stay up for 1-20 seconds or as long as new turtles are shooted.\r\nThis new Special Weapon also includes a famous sound when you picked it up.\r\n\r\nAnnhilator its now a normal Special Weapon instead of a secret; but its room isn’t allways open.\r\n\tAnnhilator: Improved the effects on the bullet. Still has only one shot (kills zombies and walls on his way).\r\n\tGiant Chainsaw: “Lag” on the user completly removed. When picking it you will keep moving as normal.\r\n\tGravity Gun: Improved damage on throwing objects and will be usable until the core. Improved Area of Effect when pushing zombies. The “?” room with the Gravity Gun contains now several pickable items. There is also a high-damage-pickable cat somewhere, go find it!\r\n\tVulcan-Minigun: power increased by +50%. Area of effect slightly increased aswell.\r\n\r\n\tThere are now 8 Special Weapon Rooms (“?” Rooms) instead of 4, wich contain every round (except on Bestial Mode) all the 8 Special Weapons: Annihilator, FlameThrower, Freezer, GravityGun, GiantChainsaw, RocketLauncher, TurtleThrower and the Vulcan-Minigun.\r\n\tSpecial Weapon Rooms reworked: better visuals and now only require a single Crouch-Jump for getting in; none for getting out.\r\n\r\n\tNew Monster available for Zombies, wich is slow and deadly at the same time.\r\n\tJumping-Zombie-Knife won’t get deactivated by the Core-Event. Watch out humans!\r\n\tTeleport-Zombies-Gun is now activated with Right-Click instead of “on picking it”. This weapon generates a fase-event in front of the human wielding it that will Teleport any zombie that touches it into the Jail-Room. Remains for 15 second after activation, only one charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame Modes and Gameplay:\r\n\r\n\tNew Selection Mode: Reverse Mode. In this mode you will start at the Coliseum and you will finish at the Spawn zones. Its a faster round very different from the other rounds. Like Silent Hill Mode, Reverse Mode gots his own diferent.ending.\r\n\r\n\tMasacre at the Buyzone Mode: now there is an invisible wall in the middle of the dark corridor with the light (the Buyzone) as an attempt to reduce the starting Zombie Infection.\r\n\r\n\tSilent Hill and No-Wall Modes now only require 1 person (instead of 2) for activating. However, the new random-spawning won’t allow you to chose the closest number to those places as previously.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Spawn-Rooms (From 0 to 9) will teleport you now to a random destination inside the labyrinth instead of a fixed one; so you can’t chose where you will appear (only with what people).\r\n\tThe Spawns on the First Labyrinth have now “Magic Portals” that will teleport you to the opposite side of the Labyrinth.\r\n\t\r\n\tReduced the lag and increased the FPS on the Core.\r\n\tHumans have 1.5 extra seconds during the Core Event before the “Massive Zombie Teleport” occurs.\r\n\tAdded a new ramp (blocked by a Barrier) on the Core. This ramp is there for people that are a little late to the core, or those falling down (but not inside the Core). Barrier opens at the same time as the “Holding Spot” ones.\r\n\r\n\tThe Powerup “It’s a Trap!” (only Zombie) is now destroyed if a human touches it, preveting zombies from activating it.\r\n\tThe Powerup “It’s a Trap!” will teleport people to the Second Labyrinth instead of the First Labyrinth.\r\n\tThe Powerup “Global Push” its now “only Humans” (for activating) and will affect only to zombies.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisuals and Design (all new visual changes have been done or opined by Kaemon, less the Core):\r\n\r\n\tReworked slightly the Spawn Room to fit with the ending of the new “Reverse Mode”.\r\n\tReworked visuals of the First Labyrinth: Every one of the 8 zones has now diferent looking walls; aswell as a “Magic Portal” at the start. The basic idea of the 1st Labyrinth remains unchanged; changes were only aesthetic.\r\n\tReworked slighly the visuals of the Second Labyrinth; looks nicer and the doors fit perfectly on every place where they appear.\r\n\tReworked the Coliseum for a nicer look and to fit with the new “Reverse Mode”.\r\n\tReworked completly the visuals of the Core Room for great looking and epic ending.\r\n\r\n\tReworked the Defending Zones at the end of the First and Second Labyrinths; they look nicer and are easier to defend.\r\n\tReworked the “Crate-Defending-Spots” at the middle of the Core. Now zombies can’t infect humans from down so easly; and if they give it a try they will fall into the Core deeps right after.\r\n\r\n\tChanged the Map and the Signs on the Jail Room: Now uses cardinals directions instead of numbers; doors teleports are also more logically placed respectly to the map in the floor.\r\n\tChanged the Radar and Global Overviews to mach with the new Special Weapon Rooms (“?” Rooms), also added a “Z” to indicate the eight zombie-only teleports back to the Jail Room.\r\n\tThe Powerup “Global Darkness” reworked; now is less annoying and can’t be confused with “Total Blindness” anymore.\r\n\tThe weird and ugly black shadows had been fixed; now the map illumination is normal.\r\n\r\nExtras:\r\n\r\n\tEntData has been slightly reduced. (Map should work better)\r\n\tNow there is a “Boring round” event that will activate if not a single human reaches the 2nd Labyrinth before the minute 5:00 mark. When this happen, humans still have 20 seconds to reach some of the 2nd Labyrinth doors; if they fail doing so, “Human Ownage” will be activated, ending the round.\r\n\tNow there are 3 Trigger Hurts at the Jail, White Room and Coliseum Teleporting Zone that will do allmost no-damage to humans staying on them for some seconds; but will kill them faster after those seconds. This is to prevent last humans being AFK inside some AFK Zombies.\r\n\r\n\tRemake of the Core-Ending Zone for making it more Human-Friendly was discussed; but with 7 Special Weapons (not Annihilator, Pistols or Gandalf’s Staff included) available on each round., and 1.5 extra seconds before the zombies “mass-teleport”, was found un-necesary and remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n\tFor all those that still don’t know, for using most of the Special Weapons, select your Knife or Grenade, and use your Secondary Mouse Button. This includes also the Pistol Weapons: “Teleport Zombies” (a single use), “Grenade Maker” (15 charges), “Sprint Weapon” and “Invulnerabilty Weapon”.\r\nExceptions are: the GiantChainsaw (wich is allways activated), Gandalf’s Staff (wich has an usable button in the middle, like it does in Moria), the C4-Explosive (wich must be used and then throwed; destroys Labyrinth walls and hurt zombies) and the Flying Elites, Destroying Labyrinth Pistol and Hurt Zombies Pistol (wich are all three activated for a short time after picking them).\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges at v4_1:\r\n- Stadium fixed\r\n- Triggers optimized (less chance of server crash)\r\n- Some not important adjustments\r\n- Minor bug fixes\r\n\r\nChanges at v4:\r\n- Zombie Boss Speed reduced from 2.5 to 2.0 and deactivates in both Core and SilentHill endings.\r\n- Added a new \"Powerup\" that switches the player controls.\r\n- Removed the \"Powerup\" of \"Weak Humans\" (reduced their life to 1 hp; being senseless on normal mode, and making all die by fire on Sillent Hill mode)\r\n- Removed the \"Human Push\" at the ending of the Core.\r\n- The \"Powerup\" Global Push\" won't activate after Silent Hill or No Walls modes are activated.\r\n- Some Triggers optimized or converted into Logic_Relay for better optimization and reducing the EntData of the map.\r\n- Zombies in the \"Jail Room\" (9 Doors Room) can't no longer Teleport to a Zone without humans (this should encourage the Human vs Zombie fight on the 1st labyrinth).\r\n- Reworked the \"Hold Position\" on the Core (the old Crates) into an easier to defend zone.\r\n- Every 40 seconds; humans on the \"Jail Room\" have a chance to escape and use the doors to teleport back to the Labyrinth; whoever, they will be unarmed >:-)\r\n- Sprint Weapon won't work on the Silent Hill mode ending.\r\n- The Anhiliator's Damage and Area of Effect had been increased.\r\n- Giant Chainsaw's Damage greatly increased (from 500 to 1000/sec).\r\n- Silent Hill's Mode: Red Circle of Light now should work on all rounds. It was getting bugged when Gadalf's staff was picked on that round.\r\n- Now, when Bestial Mode is activated, the 1st Labyrinth won't have any walls.\r\n- Silent Hill secret breakable button has been removed. It was only added for testing purpouses. Now you can’t open the Secret if it wasn’t randomly opened at the begging of the round.\r\n- Now humans have infinite ammo when holding on the Core Elevator (the very ending of the Core)\r\n- Silent Hill and No-Walls modes secret places (where you can activate them) have now a chance of 33% each of opening, and 33% of none being open.\r\n- Now there is an open Path throught the 1st Labyrinth, before the walls start to toggle. This should reduce the chances of encounter many closed walls in a row at the very beggining.\r\n- Less time of waiting in case of zombie afk or noob at spawn zone (free selection, bestial mode, random).\r\n\r\nA huge labyrinth, random walls (ways), traps, triggers, powerups, weapons, different starting modes, different game modes, many finish modes, rewards... This is not a normal ze, weird and annoying for some people, and funny and unique for another people.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the map is the next one:\r\nSpawn - A small minigame to select some zombies:\r\n- 1: random group selection\r\n- 2: zombie free group selection (zombie can choose one of the 9 CT groups)\r\n- 3: 1 faster zombie (boss mode)\r\n- 4: Massacre at buyzone: CTs and the zombie will escape from their jails, the doors will open and the zombie will be able to kill anyone at the buyzone room.\r\n- 5: Bestial mode: zombie boss+free selection+all the weapons of the map (including the Annihilator and Gandalf staff) will be spawned at the start zone.\r\n\r\n1º labyrinth - A labyrinth with random walls that open and close instantly every 10-20s.\r\n2º labyrinth - A labyrinth with moving walls that open and close every 1-5 s.\r\nThe core - Not a labyrinth. There are 3 modes of play the core.\r\n- Normal mode: humans must reach the core and defend at crates.\r\n- No walls mode (activate a trigger): humans must reach the core and not to defend.\r\n- Silent Hill mode (activate a trigger): a Silent Hill themed ending.\r\nFinal arena - if humans win, they can choose one of the 12 modes to kill the zombies (at the arena), (for example, kill with god mode).\r\n\r\n-----Defending points\r\nThe 2º and core walls are closed. Everywone starts at 1º, the first human group that reaches the 2º walls must defend his position during 30s until the walls open (if a zombie arrives before they won't open). When a labyrinth opens his exterior walls, ALL the random walls of the previous labyrinth will open. Same with core.\r\nRead more on: : i3D.net Game Forums http://forum.i3d.net/cs-source-work-progress/66742-ze_paranoid.html\r\n\r\n----Things to do the gameplay more interesting\r\nThe walls of the laberynth are random, this means that no one will know what way must follow. (i.e: you are runing and u see the 2º labyrinth exterior walls, but, 5 s before reach the walls, the wall closes in front of you, and some zombies appears at your right).\r\nMain hall of zombies, zombies will start at a hall, they can see the position of the humans and they can teleport near their positions. Humans won't die coz traps or falls, they will be teleported to the jail of this room; zombies can return to this room with some teleports at the map.\r\nSecrets, there are 4, the two more powerful triggers are hidden, and the rideable ghost and monster for zombies.\r\nEndings, there are 3 modes to reach the core (if CT activates some triggers or not).\r\nFinishing, 12 modes of killing all zombies at arena.\r\nPowerups,\r\nThere are 44 powerups at the labyrinth, that will give you powers or habilities, to everyone or to yourself or to the opposed team, etc..\r\n· Temporaly to players(11): affects the picker during 10s or 30s (speed, fly...)\r\n· Temporaly to players(7): affects everyone during 10s or 30s (blind, gravity, speed,...)\r\n· Temporaly for teams(9): affects temporaly one of the two teams during 10 or 40s (slow zombies, faster CT, unlimited ammo)\r\n· Temporaly for scenary(2): affects the scenary during 20 or 40s (darkness, inundation)\r\n· Final triggers(2): modify the scenary permanently, and changes the gameplay.\r\nWeapons\r\nThere are 5, they will change the position everyrounds:\r\n· Flamethrower: burn zombies and ignite the scenery\r\n· Rocket Launcher: throws a missile that bounces at the walls.\r\n· Giant chainsaw\r\n· Gravity gun: pick physic props and throws them, you can combite it with the flare ( a ball of inifnite duration, hurts zombies 100/s and the proyectile can attach to any zombie, the zombie can save his life touching another zombie)\r\n· Vulcan (minigun): no reloading, the only weapon that can stop a horde of zombies.\r\n· Freezer: freezes zombies during 10s. They can't move, the perfect moment to kill them easily.\r\n· Annihilator: only 1 shoot. This weapon will destroy everything, normal zombies will be instantly killed, and the doors on his path of the 1º labyrinth will be destroyed.\r\n· Gandalf staff: same as Moria. Push enemies.\r\n· Upgrade pistols (x2): blue pistol will give you more speed during 10s, green pistol will give you god mode during 20s.\r\n\r\nWeapons for zombies\r\n· Jumper power: the zombie can make big jumps and charge.\r\n· Monster: more speed and kill and stunt effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoutube video with the weapons:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alLAtzUyWjM (no Annihilator, and the ghost was removed)"

		"_sText": "Paradise takes open-ended CS:S environments to a level beyond even what The Lost World could provide by giving you a dynamic environment chock full of traps, mines, vehicles, and good old fashioned climbing against a pristine tropical backdrop. You'll find that this map offers a high amount of replay value as there are several (over four) ways to reach your objective at any one time and several perilous pitfalls to halt your progress.\r\n\r\nWALKTHROUGH:\r\n\r\nYou start disoriented in sunken ship with only your crew mates and weapons to begin with. You can break out of the lower deck by destroying the weakened hull or take another route through a damaged vent and out the other end of the ship. Option 1: You can swim straight toward the first island.\r\n\r\nOption 2: You can shoot the debris off of a sunken zodiac, where it then rises to the water's surface, and it will take you all the way to the Fishing Village.\r\n\r\nOption 1 will lead you to the beach of the first island where you have three options: Left ramp up, right ramp up, or rope straight to the top. Climbing the rope is a dangerous action as the rope will randomly break within a 10 second period, and anyone still climbing could fall to their death.\r\n\r\nEntering the island's interior will lead to new problems as land mines will throw you off the island (not kill you) and wood traps will encircle unwary victims. At the other end of the first island will offer four options: You can take a rope tram to the second island, jump over a very tall rock formation to the second island, take an old (and dangerous) cable that connects the two islands and fourth take the man's route and swim (which will probably get you zombified!).\r\n\r\nThe second island offers a much more condensed jungle with more mines to watch out for until you reach a clearing. Here are another four options: Use the hang gliders (hold the left mouse button and use WASD to glide), 'surf' down the cliff side to the V-22 Osprey waiting below in the village, jump into the water and free the zodiac boat from the cable it's attached to at the dock, or swim like a man (again, you'll probably get turned doing this.)\r\n\r\nThe boat and osprey offer their own obstacles which must be given attention, and the hang glider unfortunately cannot gain lift without sufficient wind, so either way you'll probably be treading water as you try to reach the volcanic island of Wilmekea Peak. Remember, if you need to swim, swim AROUND the buoy in order to make it to the third and final island.\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the volcanic crater, descend down the shaft to the ancient's room where remnant equipment of a failed experiment still lay awaiting input. Setting off the magma chamber charges will thus make Wilmekea unstable and will eventually trigger a spectacular eruption that will destroy all life on the archipelago.\r\n\r\nSECRET: The hang gliders cannot lift on their own, since they are technically gliders. However, all hang gliders can take lift from wind updrafts created from when wind currents hit cliff walls and move upward. There is a secret wind updraft against the second island's cliff, all you have to do is make a LEFT U-TURN once you get into the hang glider and fly alongside the cliff TOWARD spawn. Gain enough altitude and you'll be able to fly all the way to Wilmekea Peak!\r\n\r\nTIPS: HOLD the left mouse button down and use WASD to control the glider. Gliders are not precision machines, they respond to directional movements slowly and cannot fly backwards... easily.\r\n\r\nSwim AROUND the buoy in the ocean to reach the other side of the ocean currents in order to reach Wilmekea Peak.\r\n\r\nThere is a zodiac hanging by a cable on the dock & fillet house at the Fishing Village. Shoot the cable and the boat will fall into the ocean. Watch out for ocean-faring predators!\r\n\r\nPress the emergency button in the V-22 Osprey aircraft to commence extraction. You can climb on top of the V-22 if things get hairy, but keep your eyes peeled for incoming objects.\r\n\r\nISSUES: Low FPS is experienced by older computers. Sorry, that's the price that's paid for open ended environments like Paradise. The vast majority of users should not have a problem.\r\n\r\nThere are also minor vehicle glitches, but most of the time things should run smoothly. Please tell me if you experience an overwhelming amount of glitches with the Osprey. To alleviate the \"falling out\" effect, try jumping onto the roof of the Osprey while you wait for extraction.\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\n\r\nJuly 23, 2009 1023 Zulu\r\n\r\nThe South Pacific has long been of interest to the Americans as it has traditionally provided a haven for radical South Asian terrorist cells. As a SEALS Operator you were sent undercover on an oiltanker to investigate local terrorism in the pristine Wilmekea Archipelago. Unfortunately, your tanker hit a WWII-era mine that degraded the hull. Upon arriving to shore it was clear that there were no humans--instead this place seems to have been a terrorist biochemical facility gone awry.\r\n\r\nA virulent rabies strain had been developed at Wilmekea and has since spread to every island. A crewmate has been bit by an infected rat and quickly turned. You must reach the local Fishing Village for extraction, and await further orders. Paradise is over, son.\r\n\r\nMap by: Butterknife (Jaekto)\r\nTexture support: Japetheape\r\nFlora & Fauna: Stene, Raptor Phillips\r\n\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my other maps: Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Teen Pregnancy!"

Also, As you might have noticed, I have NOT described this new level -I won't-. I want you to legally beat the WHOLE map, and because of that I will only say one thing about the last level: if you fail, you go back to MASSACRE. Sounds hard, huh? We will see. \r\n\r\nPS: There's a way in which you can actually disable that level loss; read what Console says (it might help)."
