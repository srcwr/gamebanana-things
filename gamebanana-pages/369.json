WHen the flags reaches top the point is fully captured.\r\n\r\nWhen a team wins a checkpoint their ballon will get a speedbost for 16 seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen race ends both teams will be disarmed and will be teleported to the kill room, winners will get equiped with a m249 and will start a rampage, after 10 seconds all losers will die and a new round will start.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nChangelog\r\n\r\n--v1--\r\n\r\nFirst release\r\n\r\n--v1b--\r\n\r\nFixed Flag bug, now respawns correctly.\r\n\r\n--v2--\r\n-Added lighting, also added HDR.\r\n-Balloons and boats now have reflective surfaces.\r\n-Added startmusic (Lets get ready to rumble).\r\n-Fixed old bugs.\r\n-The hangar doors now rotates instead to move up, allowing players to rush to the enemies base but can't enter in the enemy spawnroom.\r\n-Time until door opens increased to 20 seconds\r\n-Inside the boats players can get now grenades and AWPs.\r\n\r\n--v2b--\r\n-Fixed server crash\r\n-Improved lighthing and shadows on displacements.\r\n\r\n--v2c--\r\n-Excesive dropped weapons wil be removed\r\n-Added 3DSkybox\r\n-Bug fixed on checkpoint 3 & 4\r\n\r\n--v2d--\r\n-Less dropped weapons in the map will be abled.\r\n-Fixed the weapon spawn glicth.\r\n\r\n--v3--\r\n-Bigger map with improved design.\r\n-New boat design.\r\n-Alternative tracks for later ballon that makes shorter tracks.\r\n-AWP replaced by scouts.\r\n-Balloons max speed increased.\r\n-Less time to increase 20% speed and more time to decrease 20% speed.\r\n-Medical kit gives x2 HP.\r\n-Players spawn with usp and 1000 ammo.\r\n-Now weapons are locked, when a balloon reachs first CP or both balloons are near from first CP players will be able to use strong weapons.\r\n-Checkpoint 1 and checkpoint 3 with new desing that improves fights.\r\n-Now Flag dont need to be dropped unde the arrow to win the point.\r\n-When a player pickups the flag he must capture in 30 seconds, after this time flag will respawn.\r\n-Fixed bugs when CP are captured incorrectly."

I saw that people use to play maps of  jails that have got always the same form and only change the  textures so i decided to make one a bit diferent ( for example the jails will open with a scanner eye) ^^.\r\n\r\nThe map has got  a game like stepmania. There is a pool and somes rooms where you can escape of the Cts and  vents with witch T can escape from the jail and get a weapon to kill CTs. There are lasers on the vents so if someone touch that a sirene will play the sound and somes lights will turn on.\r\n\r\nI create a form to kill Ts if CTs want that ^^. There is a room. If where you can lock the door and open other that  will push him to the space and kill them because they havent got oxygen ^^ \r\n\r\nI wish see my map at diferent servers and that people will have fun with it ^^ thanks"
