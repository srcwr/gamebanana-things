Easy!\r\n\r\nYou start in one of the spawns (T and CT are blocked with 2 barriers and an invisible block bullet texture) and right in front of you there is a weapons menu. The Spotlight that is lighting up the weapon group means that the weapon group is enabled for use, even tho, you dont spawn with ammo. So watch for your ammo in the magazine.\r\n\r\nAfter you choose your weapon you press the red button (on left side for CT, and right side for T), by that lights go on and a bullseye appears. You must destroy the bullseye with your team, so that a wall to the exit breaks and you can go out surfing.\r\n\r\nNotice that only on the 2nd round you will be able to pick up newer weapons like Deagle, 5-7, elites and p228 + a random group of weapons (which are SMGs; 1 scout sniper; \"M3 group\" (M3, xm1014, Sg552, AUG)). The group with AWP will be unlocked by reaching the \"awp temple\", which appears to be at the house below the spawn.\r\n\r\nIf you get in jail, there are 5 houses, which have 1 button in each. Every button unlocks the Exit door, but after the button gets locked.\r\n\r\nTo unlock the buttons you must reach the top of the jail and press the green button on the rotating cross. The red button smashed the players with the roof if they are inside of one of the 5 houses. The 6th house is the exit house.\r\n\r\nFor first time you may not understand how to play the map, but it's quite easy after all. I already experienced on my own map. :')\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nIf you may need a video to understand how to surf on the map, I made one already.\r\nGo [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_1qnv5UGtE \"here.\").\r\n\r\nI hope you like the map. Thanks for your attention!\r\nTill the new projects!\r\n\r\n-Mr. Darkness\r\n\r\nEDIT: If you click the video, then turn off the sound, please! :')"

For that I need some more testers, helping me to find bugs and improving my map. Any constructive feedback is welcome, excluding that the design is copied from BuckNasty.\r\n\r\nAt this point I need to say that I've already talked to Buck Nasty about the design sheme and it's textures. He helped me finding a new collection (thanks for that) which <b>I didn't use in this version yet </b>. So don't worry, it's gonna be changed on further versions.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who helped me with this map yet.\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- On the big half-cicled ramp you get stack sometimes but mostely it will work fine. (Most annoying)\r\n- Some spotlights, spawning under water, have some strange lighting errors.\r\n- Sometimes you don't get a knife, if you fell down into jail.\r\n- You can walk in the middle of the spawn (the wall) tought there are 2 trigger_pushes in 2 different directions (like one to the left, one to the right, if you stand in the middle you won't be pushed anywhere).\r\n- In the middle of the map, on the round platform, the push sometimes doesn't push you far enough (to jail).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nThis is a fast map with all its boosters and fast weapon spawners without pressing buttons anymore. Also you don't need to wait for somebody to help you, if you fall to jail, anymore, as you can simply walk away - but without weapons.\r\nAll ramps are smooth and can be surfed from both sides. Buyzone and \"secret\" shotgun are still included. The bomb-target activates itself after 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it and please post as much feedback as possible, whatever is in your mind.\r\n\r\nCheers, Krusty"
