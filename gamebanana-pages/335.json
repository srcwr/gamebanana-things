The elements are:\r\nWater, Fire, Leaf, Light, Shadow, Mechanical.\r\nEach element has it's own \"style\".\r\nThe Water temple consists of water skipping.\r\nThe Fire temple consists of upward boosts.\r\nThe Leaf temple consists of bunny hopping.\r\nThe Light temple consists of tele hopping/speed gaining.\r\nThe Shadow temple consists of illusion/deception.\r\nThe Mechanical Temple consists of moving obstacles.\r\nWhen you start the map, you are given 500 hp (server with spawn protection, you might want to sit in spawn for the extra 6 seconds before you run off).\r\nIf at any given time you notice that you are running low on health, you can go back to spawn and re-up. This of course will cost you time, but if you're desperate enough you will be willing to sacrifice.\r\nThe \"systems\" of the map. There is no specific order for the temples to be beaten in. Any order that pleases you will do. The map is team oriented, if a team gains a check for ALL temples they are sent to an arena to eliminate the opposing team.\r\nIf the teams don't gather enough checks within the 4 minutes given, the temple with the most falls is found and a jail corresponding to that temple will be activated.\r\nYou will also notice a Triforce on the floor where you warp back at, through out the map there are 1/6 Triforce pieces on each level. Collect all the pieces and create a full Triforce at the element selection zone. The rest is for you to find out.\r\nOnce you've reached bonus, everyone will be teleported to a room that is approximately 2 seconds behind you, you will then have to race through obstacles from each element and the winner is brought to a box where they can choose an element. Depending on which element they choose, they losers will be faced with a mini-game of that element."

Surf_Dynasty is a brand new, fully original linear/combat map that satisfies just about any surfers desires. If you're more into the combat side, there are copious amounts of weapons to acquire at spawn for you to duke it out with. For someone looking for a serious surfing experience, anti spawn camping precautions have been set up so no one can interfere with your surfing.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 minutes, your screen will shake indicating the round is over. all players will be teleported to the lower tier of jail on their respective side if they haven't left spawn or have failed since time ran out. If you reached the checkpoint, you will have been teleported to jail with a better weapon and position advantage. You will also retain a higher health. If you finish the map or bonus, you will get the strongest weapon plus the best location in jail as well as your health.\r\n\r\nThere is a bonus located somewhere in the middle of the surf, be warned though, many have attempted this secret stage, but very few have succeeded.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is an abundance of secrets in the spawn area, some are easy to attain and some are quite dastardly. Also, shoot the gong."

It's about 2x bigger than the original, so it may be on bigger servers.\r\n\r\n**The map has:**\r\n\r\n- 60 sec bomb-planting protection,\r\n\r\n- 8 different trail nades,\r\n\r\n- Secret teleports (with the windows, shot it and u will be teleported. Firstly find out which window it is),\r\n\r\n- Jail with weapons strip and deagle recieve,\r\n\r\n- 2 bombsites,\r\n\r\n- Buy Zone at the middle of the map,\r\n\r\n- And of course weapons set at the whole map,\r\n\r\n**Known bugs:**\r\n\r\n- Lighting problems (shadows where they shouldn't supposed to be),\r\n\r\n- It is possible to get on the \"walls\" of the middle map and just walk on it, but I can't fix it in 100%, because it's just good in Hammer Editor, but I made everything I could to fix it,\r\n\r\n- bad optimalization - when looking at the whole map it drops to about 160, when just being on ramps, etc. - 300. Just didn't want to waste my time on optimalizing it, sorry. I don't know much about it.\r\n\r\nTHIS MAP PROPABLY WON'T BE EVER UPDATED.\r\n\r\nThanks for playing anyway.\r\n\r\n@EDIT: Recommended RPG mod, it has been tested on RPG server and gameplay is so nice!"

Its a big map so i recommend the MAPTIME TO 4.0 or more! \r\nThe first stage leads you to a small platform and second one leads you to weapons or (lower one) directly to the battlefield/jail. \r\nThere is a bombspot at the end of the map and the jail can be escaped with a teammate ^^\r\n\r\n\r\n... so please give me some nice comments and have fun with this map - Rebell <img src=http://www.deltaforceteam.de/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif>"

(six in all)\r\n\r\nThere are other weapons on the map than shotguns and HE grenades, but frankly, the shotguns are probably all you'll need. (3 awps, about 3 paras, a bunch of pistols and some mp5navy's.)\r\n\r\nThere are alot, and I mean ALOT, of trigger_pushes on this map, so expect it to be a twitchy and fast surfing map, it has no invisible walls, so feel free to cut around the map as you see fit. But you'll have to either know the directions the paths take or guess it by the layout of the map, otherwise you'll end up falling off the ramp when you run headfirst into a trigger_push going in the opposite direction. So perhaps at first just follow what appears to be the logical path. Later, you'll be able to cut around and pull Top Gun like tricks to get behind your enemy and shotgun the hell out of them, at least, in an idealistic movie-based world.\r\n\r\nThe \"bowl\" on the map has trigger_push'es that go around it's rim in a counter-clockwise fasion, this is used to get to the second level of the map (and there's a second way to do this aswell, but if you happen to have come this way, you can use the bowl to go up to the next level. \r\n\r\nOh, and there's a bunch of useless space in the back end of each of the spawns, don't bother looking for secrets there, later versions might utilize this space more efficiently. \r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditions in final2 version:\r\n\r\n-bomb site at the top of the map\r\n-water in the teleports (for non-block mod servers)\r\n-shoutout to faj in map\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to:\r\nFAJ (assorted help throughout the whole mapping process, compiling surf_dune_v1/v2)\r\nChaostheory (compiling surf_dune_final)\r\nAssaulted Combat (for finally getting a due date set so I wouldn't procrastinate anymore)\r\nBuck (compiling surf_dune_final2)\r\n\r\nThey see me rollin, they hatin, patrollin, and tryin to catch me ridin' dirty."

There are four surf paths or varying difficulty giving you a pistol. Obviously the better pistols are on the harder paths. From the secondary run you are teleported to the Primary Run. The primary run has the same idea as the secondary run; four paths of varying difficulty giving you a primary weapon based on the difficulty, except the primary surf paths are much longer and harder. From the primary run you are teleported to the Combat Arena. Each team has its own (yet identical) secondary and primary runs. In the combat arena you will meet the other team and there you do battle.\r\n\r\nHere is the catch; you only get one chance at each run. If you fail in the secondary run you are teleported to the primary run without a pistol. If you fail in the primary run you are teleported to the jail in the combat arena without a primary weapon. The player must think a little about how confident they are with their surfing ability to decide what path to take.\r\n\r\nOn the primary paths, there are blue sparkles. Going through these will give you grenades. They are positioned to make the run slightly harder. There is an afk timer. People who are afk or camping in the runs get teleported forward (eventually to the combat arena). There is no fall damage for the whole map.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secrets around the map. Including a hidden Zanz the NERD Run, which is the most difficult and gives the best rewards."
