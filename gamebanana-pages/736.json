A team of terrorists has infiltrated the base, intent on disrupting their foreign enemies at any cost. A team of counter-terrorists has been dispatched to protect the facility and to eliminate the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\nThe map is built for teams of 5 or more. It easily supports 16+ players and encourages organized teamplay above other maps. The map is built in such a way that no matter where you are, you’re never safe from attack. Most locations in the map that give players an advantage over one location are vulnerable from another. This forces players to be vigilant, and to stick together to cover each other.\r\n\r\nGameplay is a mix of short- and long-range combat, though rifles seem to serve players better overall. There are plenty of sniper spots and flanking opportunities.\r\n\r\nFor comments or questions email cesig.moreis@gmail.com.

The priceless treasures within this church have yet to be discovered by the occupying forces. Insure that these relics remain sacred, at all costs.\r\n\r\nBomb Target B:\r\nThe enemy has been stockpiling countless artifacts within the Great Tower until their relief can arrive to transport the treasures away. We must cause as much damage to the Great Tower as possible, but because of the occupation our access to the tower is greatly limited. Our best chance of saving the artifacts is bombing the mouth of the tower. Doing so will seal the tower shut and delay the evacuation of the loot. And this, our father willing, will cripple our enemies and insure your righteous glory in the everlasting."

The priceless treasures within this church have yet to be discovered by the occupying forces. Insure that these relics remain sacred, at all costs.\r\n\r\nBomb Target B:\r\nThe enemy has been stockpiling countless artifacts within the Great Tower until their relief can arrive to transport the treasures away. We must cause as much damage to the Great Tower as possible, but because of the occupation our access to the tower is greatly limited. Our best chance of saving the artifacts is bombing the mouth of the tower. Doing so will seal the tower shut and delay the evacuation of the loot. And this, our father willing, will cripple our enemies and insure your righteous glory in the everlasting."

A group of terrorists is showing sudden interest in the abandoned facility. Intel suggests that an attack is\r\nimminent at sunset to blast open the sealed doors.\r\n\r\nThe map is reminiscent of old-school deathmatch maps for Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force in regard to visual theme and general ambience. Those maps had great influence on me as a level designer some 12 years ago (the nostalgia :) especially \"boot camp\" and \"lambda bunker\". The Black Mesa inspiration can be seen throughout the map in several design aspects.\r\n\r\nde-derelict-base features indoor locations as well as some outdoor areas. The gameplay is fast and distributed between narrow hallways and large tunnels and outdoor sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual, the map is fully optimized to ensure fluid gameplay and consistent high FPS.\r\n\r\nThe map has:\r\n\r\n- 64 spawn points (32 vs 32) \r\n- radar overview\r\n- Soundscapes\r\n- Nav file with place names\r\n\r\nFor installation, simply extract the 4 files in the zip archive (bsp, nav and 2 txt files) to your \\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps folder.\r\n\r\nI really hope you enjoy this map as much as I did creating it.\r\nComments and constructive feedback are always welcome.\r\n\r\nWill2k\r\n\r\nNovember 12, 2011"
