Sometimes a player needs to activate a monitor or key, this is shown by having a green glow. Green glow means it must be pressed, default key is E. Red glow means it is locked and something must be done to unlock the button. If there is no glow, it is of little interest. To obtain the plans/coordinates simply walk to the table.

There is a window into it and the 4 options are available. On choosing a difficulty the game will restart by killing everyone.\r\n\r\n### V3 Changes\r\n- Nerfing the octagon to 1 on easy, 2 on normal, 4 on hard and 6 on suicide\r\n- Changed secrets to p90 with UNLIMITED ammo!

Hate my songs? mute it!\r\n- Added a paypal sign at the start for those warm hearth-ed fellows!\r\n- Fixed the voice acting lines not being packed into the map! It NOW has actual voice acting!

I got puzzled by how to do them so I need more time to do some tests on my own. If anyone knows how to add difficulty levels, please let me know and I will get to it ASAP. For the time being, the map is “stucked” on the normal difficulty. I really want to add this feature soon as I think it will improve the life time of my map greatly.\r\nI just realized that I forgot to add an afk killer.

Note, i have fixed one bug that hardly any one knows about, this bug can kill the game if found out. So i deeply suggest updating to v1_8b to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nBut on another note, this map was made for a challenge ageanst The-Gregster-101. In this challenge we hope to replace the old Boat Escape, with something more better looking and more fun to play on. I allready seen Gregster map and it alot of fun to play on, so if you havent seen it yet give it ago if its on a server."

This update aims to improve the game play of the level by making it easier for humans in certain areas.\r\n\r\n.Gives more time for humans to get into the fort after boat ride.\r\n\r\n.Harder for zombies to cut people off near tram area.\r\n\r\n.Two shotguns added to fort. \r\n\r\n.Made it harder for humans to get onto the boat, this forces humans to be a tad more pro active and move. \r\n\r\n.Lots of little fixes.*\r\n\r\n*Update; ok ok.... This is hopefully going to be the last update. This update fixes all missing sounds and music that did not get adding when I was using Pakrat...*\r\n\r\n*Updated; this update is only for people with more than 62 player servers. All this patch does is increase the number of player spawns to fix problems some servers were having.*\r\n\r\nHi all, this is a big update for Grand Boat Escape. It comes in two versions, day time version set during the day, and night time version set during night time with a little lightening going on in the background. Both night time and day time versions come with the same amount of fixes and optimizations. \r\n\r\nThe main improvement in this update is with the increase of fps. Overall there should be around 100-200 added fps what should smooth out everyone experience during play. There also a whole host of other features and bug fixes that should improve game play but also looks.\r\n\r\nSadly to improve the fps some visuals needed to be toned down but hopefully it will not be too noticeable when you guys are playing online.\r\n\r\n**'Posted on older version, but still applies'**\r\n\r\nThis is Grand Boat Escape, its a massive update that took me a little while to do. It recreates tons of features within this map to improve game play and scenery. Overall, this map has been made to be MUCH harder, I felt that the older version out currently was way too easy and got boring very fast, but that should all change now with the amount of changes that has been added in version 3_6. Hope you guys/girls really like it.\r\n\r\nIf your interested in seeing what the old version looked like, go here: Grand Boat Escape\r\n\r\nAdded Feature List:\r\n\r\n.More routs, this to hopefully give the player more power on witch way they go instead of just straight.\r\n\r\n.Added boxes, they need to be jumped over by humans, but can be instantly be destroyed by zombies touching it. This is to slow the humans down and allow the zombies to catch up.\r\n\r\n.Added douche bag doors, These doors can be permanently closed by a human. Thing is, they don't even block out zombies that well. I added them to block out other humans by slightly faster \"trolly\" individuals forcing the humans to take other routs.\r\n\r\n.Greatly improved end fort, what has multiple layers and a Air Ship at the end that the humans must defend, and many more things.\r\n\r\n.Changed the boat, hopefully will be better than the old one, It also allows the zombies to get in from the water, very hard though.\r\n\r\n.Greatly improved the lighting and effects.\r\n\r\n.3d Sky Box has now be finally added, this makes the map look much more larger.\r\n\r\n.A lot of optimization has been done, to make way for all the improvements.\r\n\r\n.In-proved sounds/music.\r\n\r\n.and allot more! probably."

		"_sText": "*Update; Well... I would like to say this will be the last update, but as you can see that's been happening for a while now. This update aims to improve the game play of the level by making it easier for humans in certain areas.\r\n\r\n.Gives more time for humans to get into the fort after boat ride.\r\n\r\n.Harder for zombies to cut people off near tram area.\r\n\r\n.Two shotguns added to fort.\r\n\r\n.Made it harder for humans to get onto the boat, this forces humans to be a tad more pro active and move. \r\n\r\n.Lots of little fixes.*\r\n\r\n*Update; ok ok.... This is hopefully going to be the last update. This update fixes all missing sounds and music that did not get adding when I was using Pakrat...*\r\n\r\n*Updated; this update is only for people with more than 62 player servers. All this patch does is increase the number of player spawns to fix problems some servers were having.*\r\n\r\nHi all, this is a big update for Grand Boat Escape. It comes in two versions, day time version set during the day, and night time version set during night time with a little lightening going on in the background. Both night time and day time versions come with the same amount of fixes and optimizations. \r\n\r\nThe main improvement in this update is with the increase of fps. Overall there should be around 100-200 added fps what should smooth out everyone experience during play. There also a whole host of other features and bug fixes that should improve game play but also looks.\r\n\r\nSadly to improve the fps some visuals needed to be toned down but hopefully it will not be too noticeable when you guys are playing online.\r\n\r\n**'Posted on older version, but still applies'**\r\n\r\nThis is Grand Boat Escape, its a massive update that took me a little while to do. It recreates tons of features within this map to improve game play and scenery. Overall, this map has been made to be MUCH harder, I felt that the older version out currently was way too easy and got boring very fast, but that should all change now with the amount of changes that has been added in version 3_6. Hope you guys/girls really like it.\r\n\r\nIf your interested in seeing what the old version looked like, go here: Grand Boat Escape\r\n\r\nAdded Feature List:\r\n\r\n.More routs, this to hopefully give the player more power on witch way they go instead of just straight.\r\n\r\n.Added boxes, they need to be jumped over by humans, but can be instantly be destroyed by zombies touching it. This is to slow the humans down and allow the zombies to catch up.\r\n\r\n.Added douche bag doors, These doors can be permanently closed by a human. Thing is, they don't even block out zombies that well. I added them to block out other humans by slightly faster \"trolly\" individuals forcing the humans to take other routs.\r\n\r\n.Greatly improved end fort, what has multiple layers and a Air Ship at the end that the humans must defend, and many more things.\r\n\r\n.Changed the boat, hopefully will be better than the old one, It also allows the zombies to get in from the water, very hard though.\r\n\r\n.Greatly improved the lighting and effects.\r\n\r\n.3d Sky Box has now be finally added, this makes the map look much more larger.\r\n\r\n.A lot of optimization has been done, to make way for all the improvements.\r\n\r\n.In-proved sounds/music.\r\n\r\n.and allot more! probably."

The only way into the 'Other' is through a large portal. this portal will take you to the 'Other' and will be the main host of all the areas, on this map.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots show the first area in the other. But all together there are 6 areas, includeing spawn, some defending spots and some runing spots, and a citadel what holds the gods heart.\r\n\r\nand dw the spawn is split up into 3 areas, and should keep 'zombie powning' to a min.\r\n\r\nNote... i have only said some of the few things that are on this map, but there are many others. ALSO this is alpha, so bare with there may be bugs...\r\n\r\nFixed in v3_2b\r\n\r\n.fixed spawn\r\n\r\n.fixed ending \r\n\r\n.added zombie blokers\r\n\r\n.made the hole thing a bit more easyer for humans\r\n\r\n.fixed glitch on first area, under ruin temple\r\n\r\n.afk mover\r\n\r\n.and more\r\n\r\nDONT RESUBMIT MY WORK OR I SEND MY DRUNK FRIENDS AFTER YOU!"

Marines have the safety of numbers, well stocked ammo and teamwork, where as the Predators must use their cunning and stealth abilities to kill the marines.\r\n\r\n**Where do I get the mod?**\r\n===========================\r\nI am aware that there are not many versions of the mod available in the source mod world, but I have scripted up my own version with a lot of customize-able options for admins. If you would like to download this mod, please visit [THE MOD DOWNLOAD PAGE](http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/hideexecmvp \"\") to do so.\r\n\r\n**Story**\r\n=========\r\nThe map is based at the top research facility for genetic experimentation, high up in the hills of the Blue Mountains has been attacked.\r\nThe screams at the other end of the radio were horrendous. The Elevator was on lock down while the initial attack began, so your team was trapped on the lower floors of the facility, so you could do nothing but watch on the monitors as scientists and security guards were ripped apart by invisible creatures.\r\n\r\nThere is silence now. No one is left but your squad.\r\n\r\nYou are marines, you are strong, you are smart...you are being hunted....\r\n\r\n**The mechanics of the map**\r\n============================\r\nThere are 2 parts to the map. The topside, surrounded by hills with a house and a tool shed in the middle, then the underground complex where the research is done.\r\nThe marines have just made it through the service elevator onto the second floor after a 12 hours lock down.\r\nThere are creaks and groans that can be heard in the distance, as well as a faint sound that could be mistaken for an engine.\r\n\r\nThe marines must brave the corridors of the lab and have 2 ways to reach the surface (via an elevator or through the pipe work).\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n=========\r\nThis is the first map I have done that I incorporated soundscape scripts into the level. I have found they create a nice atmosphere and surrounding. For those of you who don't know what soundscapes are, they are background sounds that trigger when a player moves into the target radius (ie when walking from indoors to outdoors). The soundscape triggers and the player hears a variety of sounds, for example: The outdoor area of this map is raining, so the primary soundscape is raining, but has wind howling, crickets etc in the background as well, where as inside, underground, you hear the humming sound of lab equipment.\r\nFor those of you who have never used them in your map, look at a tutorial and do it. Makes it so much more immersive.\r\n\r\nI also had a bit more of a play around with cubemaps. They made the glass look at lot more solid and the reflective capabilities blend nice with the reflective floor. This is especially good when the lights are turned off and the backup power turns on."

While deep in the forest the convoy was ordered to stop.\r\nThe forest went silent. No howls from the winds or birds singing.\r\nThen they attacked.\r\nIt all happened so fast. There were screams in all directions; torsos flying through the air.\r\nWe couldn't see the enemy, we could only hear their roars of satisfaction as each man was cut down where he stood.\r\n\r\nWe have managed to push them back, but our vehicles and radios have been damaged. \r\nIt has started to rain now; lighting and thunder crashing through the sky.\r\n\r\nWe will not survive this.\r\n\r\n**The mechanics of the map**\r\n============================\r\nThere are few things to this map. The Marines start at the opposite end of the map to the predators. There are 3 weapon cache's filled with AK47s, M4A1s and P90s. There is also an awp and 2 m3's around the corps' of your fallen comrades.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high rise points in the map to make your final stand, as well as a cave leading from the marine spawn to the broken down bunker further up the track.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n=========\r\nThe map is filled with tree and bush props and some uses my first ever custom displacement (was a good project to learn on).\r\n\r\nThere is also func_precipitation throughout the entire map causing heavy rain and some ambient generics and lights to cause a random thunder effect from 2 different sounds.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have used soundscapes to create the atmosphere of a horrific storm both indoors and out."
