This is my first map ever, however I hope it doesn't show :P  Thanks to kaddar for creating the original over 6 years ago.  And a special thanks to [FF]Elite.Jack Daniels for being my mentor, brainstormer, and advisor throughout the whole creation process.  I would very much enjoy receiving feedback on this map.  I would like to tell you that it is tested and this is the final release, however it has not been tested on a large scale and it is not the final release.  The map is optimized and ready to be played on.  Up to 32 players can enjoy this map.  CCB = Cr4zYcH1cK3nB0Y.  If you need to tell me anything about this map, you can contact me through steam.
