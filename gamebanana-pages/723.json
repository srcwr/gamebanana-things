My goal was to create something unique, and I believe I have succeeded. This difference is first apparent aesthetically, and is further exemplified in the map's layout and the way it plays. A haven for those who fear (or loathe) sniper rifles, de_gallery's focus on close quarters combat forces players to leave their instagibbing AWPs at home. While relatively small from an orthographic, top-down perspective, the Z axis received a lot of love, which adds excitement to fire-fights and allowed for a plethora of routes to be woven into the map's sequestered confines. This provides the player multiple, viable paths to any given location and allows the clever man (or woman) to outthink an opponent as opposed to simply outgunning him, while still adhearing to a coherent, linear design.\r\n\r\nTwas a long, seldom frustrating process, but I learned a lot along the way, and am proud of what I've ended up with. I hope you'll enjoy it. It is good to finally be done.\r\n\r\nThe map has a lot of variety in its envrionments, and due to the indoor nature of it, it is hard to take screenshots that do the thing justice (it must be seen!), but here are a few more shots;\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0001.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0005.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0006.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0007.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0008.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0009.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0010.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0012.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0013.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0015.jpg\r\nhttp://esunfx.com/images/finalgallery/de_gallery0003.jpg"

But this time our goal was base on red planet,\r\nnot just landing, that hapends one year after first one, in 1990.\r\nAfter 4 years, our base start to operate in 1994, but let's get to the point now.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur curiosity rover II, after daily routine exploring found some object or thing, we dont know jet what was that object\r\nbut we know that thing completlly destroy's our rover, the rover was just totally meltet down, only black box survived.\r\nOur team found black box and we linked into our computer in storage area whitch we call A section. For that operation\r\nof reading hemical materies from melted rover, and from black box we called some specialist's form international space \r\nstation.\r\nBut instead we get specialist's we got secret agent's or we can call them terorrist's in our base.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there was one more problem... in the lower part of base in section B we almost finish experiment of white \r\nenergy program, that will provide on earth free energy for all people on earth that will resolve all the problems.\r\nBut in this greaddy world that was the problem... someone want to stop our program at all coast.\r\nWe must defend this base at all coast, and if we win, we will bring nice and beeter age on earth.\r\n\r\nGood luck men."
