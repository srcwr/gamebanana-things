Originally i had the plan of getting rid of the Plaguefest sign in one of the secrets and make a seperate release for the public, but it doesn't really matter. If you need to change it on your own, just message me for the VMF and i'll gladly give it to you.\r\n\r\nAlso, i don't know why the file size is so big, i probably used a rediculous model or didn't scale down custom textures.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- Can get stuck in some displacements\r\n- Water can reflect weird sometimes (cubemaps issue i think), couldn't figure out why at the time"

THE OTHER ONE ALWAYS LEADS TO DEATH.\r\n-Redesigned the structure on the CT side cosmetically.  Took out vents and added another perch.\r\n-Enlarged inside hideout of T structure making it alittle more possible for zombies, also added glass rooms outside of there.  Outside wall of the glass will eventually break if shot too much.\r\n-Added breakable openings to the large rooms on the big building.\r\n-Lowered upper blocks and platforms to be a tad easier for zombies.\r\n-Added two more hovering platforms with teleports leading to them.  Locations of the teleports are hidden, but not too hard to figure out.\r\n-Took out second floor wrap around.  Just wasted space.\r\n-Added a couple more boxes to truck area.\r\n-Doubled damage of the killing floor so zombies die faster.\r\n-Turtles strewn about the map.  Why?  Cause I can.\r\n\r\nPLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS. \r\nLIST OF KNOWN BUGS BELOW.\r\n-For some reason the launcher that goes over the trucks on the T side launches really far, so more control is needed on that, but it's still usable.\r\n\r\nVIDEO SHOWING THE MAP WILL BE POSTED SOON WHEN I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG ADOBE PREMIERE PRO 2."

Anyone who leaked the map didn't have a working version for their server, since it didn't apply the surf settings how it regularly should have. I did a lot of balancing over time on this, and got this to a working, public state. This is by far not the best surf map, in fact, it doesn't have a whole lot of surf at all. It's basically just do a quick surf to the location you want to go and hold it.\r\n\r\nThis surf n cade style map was presented as an idea on the Plaguefest forums, but nobody had taken up the idea. Eventually after being bugged enough, i gave in and created this. Mind you, i had never really ever played surf, so i was terrible at it and didn't really know all the mechanics to surfing. For what it is, it's definitely worth giving it a try. It even has a Cade Only location for players who aren't good at surfing or can't at all.\r\n\r\nThere is only 1 secret, and it is just music. 4 different songs, 1 troll song that you need noclip to access. Songs are:\r\n\r\nWolfgang Gartner - Redline\r\n\r\nZedd - Push Play\r\n\r\nNoisecontrollers - Unite\r\n\r\nMen Without Hats - Safety Dance"

Well the reason is I havn't had a chance to test the gameplay of it with ZombieMod. So what I want from you is alot of feedback and ideas on the gameplay of the map! This is my first ZM map so I have probably done some really noobish things with the barricades or something, so tell me if I have. \r\nOfcourse, if you find any bugs or other things that ruin the map, tell me that aswell!\r\n\r\nThe map is complete with Cubemaps, Playerclips, Soundscapes and all that good stuff.
