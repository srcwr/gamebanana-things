You are on the top of the m.i.s.a. tower, more specific, in the Gallery known as \"the Junkyard\".\r\n\r\nIn 2050 the world started to recycle everything, so there was no junk of any kind left by 2080. That made junk, which was found in the dephts of the ocean or woods and swamps, extremly valuable to the collector who has everything else. Your first adress would be \"the Junkyard\", established in 2085 the Gallery sells only high class junk.\r\n\r\nOf course valuable stuff always lures some criminals. But the security team has already found out and locked the escalators.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Fight off the security team and watch out for your hostages, they are your only way out know!\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: Your first objective is to rescue the hostages. As for the intruders ...shoot on sight!\r\n\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/171/f/f/mapdetails_by_mikael_hakase-d5456iz.png\">\r\n\r\n- made for Counter-Strike: Source\r\n- cubemaps\r\n- small 3d skybox\r\n- HUD\r\n- NAV\r\n- Custom Textures\r\n- 32 Playerspawns\r\n- Ventsystem\r\n- 4 Hostages to rescue\r\n- All content is packed into BSP\r\n\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/171/9/9/credits_by_mikael_hakase-d5456eu.png\">\r\n\r\nPlease see the \"credits\" Box on the right side.

This is my entry for the Junkyard Contest and my second released map. It was made on 3.5 weekends consuming lots of Red Bull and Doctor Who. And its actually the first time I got the HUD to work, so yay for that.\r\n\r\nThe idea is kind of a longshot, but I didn't wanted to do just a \"simple\" junkyard. So thats what I came up with, I hope you like it. As always, feedback is very welcome.\r\n\r\nPlease don't decompile. If you need anything or want to know something about the map, PM me or post a comment.

Very well optimized, should run well on almost any semi-decent platform. I get a constant 100+FPS on a 4 year old machine. The map has seen a huge change since it's last release, mostly texture aligning, got rid of some brush clutter, soundscapes, a new 3d skybox, and bumpmaps for VALVe textures. This comes with a NAV file as well including info_nodes and other entities of that sort to help the hostages and bots navigate the map better. Have fun :)\r\n\r\n<fieldset><b>Change Log:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Version 3.0</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Additions</b>\r\n\r\n-Optimized the hell out of the map (nodraw plays a huge part)\r\n-Added numerous soundscapes (for better reverb and sound effects). \r\n-Added more Cubemaps (for more accurately shown reflections)\r\n-Added step in front of Podium \r\n-Added more money props, desk and office chair to left hostage room\r\n-Added tons of Info_nodes and info_node_climbs\r\n-Added button that plays church music\r\n-Added Powerbox and buttons in basement\r\n-Added immense 3d skybox\r\n-Added several bumpmaps to 3-4 textures to correct visual errors and add realism\r\n\r\n<b>Changes/Fixes</b>\r\n\r\n-Fixed Cubemaps that were being displayed from the floor below/above\r\n-Fixed Texture mis-alignments\r\n-Fixed Incorrect spawn points\r\n-Fixed color and brightness of basement lights\r\n-Fixed Mis-aligned brushes\r\n-Fixed some mis-shaped brushes effecting gameplay and lighting\r\n-Improved brush work of podium, grass, and walls.\r\n-Changed complicated objects to func_detail for a raise in performance\r\n-Changed the directions terrorists were facing when spawning\r\n-Deleted a few ambient generics that didn't play a significant role\r\n-Deleted insignificant brushes that created clutter and dropped performance\r\n-Other small changes and fixes that I forgot and really don't matter\r\n\r\n<hr></hr>\r\n<b>Version 2.0</b>\r\n<b>Additions</b>\r\n\r\n-Optimized greatly, saving 40+FPS since last version\r\n-Added 3d Skybox\r\n-Added Parking Lot\r\n-Added green window lighting effects\r\n-Added Small plants and other props\r\n-Added a few decals\r\n-Added More cubemaps\r\n-Added Ambient sounds\r\n-Added ramps on most entrances (realism sakes)\r\n-Added Front doors (doors?! holy crap really?1!?)\r\n\r\n<b>Changes/Fixes</b>\r\n\r\n-Fixed cubemaps\r\n-Fixed Water rendering\r\n-Fixed small cracks in ceiling, walls, and ground\r\n-Improved the Pews \r\n-Made ground, windows, walls, and other miscellaneous brushes thinner (realism sakes)\r\n-Changed ropes from brushes to move ropes with invis ladder textures\r\n-Changed texture of outside wall\r\n-Changed lighting in basement, nixed a few lights to make it darker\r\n-Changed front gate from crappy brush to props\r\n-Changed health of all breakable brushes (realism)\r\n-Re-built and edited nav file greatly improving efficiency of Bot gameplay\r\n-Re-arranged static props for better gameplay and hiding spots.\r\n-Some small other fixes and changes</fieldset>"

It is loosely modeled after the music building on Capital University's campus in Columbus Ohio.\r\n\r\n     HDR was not added to this map because it acted glitchy when applied.
