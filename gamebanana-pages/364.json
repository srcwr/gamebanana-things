I added HDR lighting and gave it a more natural look, like Nature is taking over. There is volumetric lighting as you can see from the screenshots. That may or may not get removed in the final, which will be version three. I think it's feeding on performance in the map, and the map is already laggy enough.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this map is to just have laggy fun, really. Yes, it can get pretty laggy sometimes. I will most likely be expanding the space between each trap in the final, and reducing the amount of traps in the map overall to try and eliminate as much lag as possible, but still have the explosive, hazardous fun that is the Source Engine. The map also features an interactive mortar that players can operate and shoot grenades out of that explode on impact. And yes, it does kill people. There is a box next to it that, if broken, will disable the mortar for the remainder of the round. You will have to figure out how to get up to the mortar to use it first though, but it's pretty easy. The map also features a funny mechanic that is a crane magnet which will move from end-to-end in the middle and pick anything up, including players. This adds to the insane fun of the physics in the Source Engine. During play-testing I got crushed countless times by objects that fell from the magnet, and other players get picked up by it, making them an easy target. \r\n\r\nThere are a few custom models in the map, so this will increase the file size obviously. I believe it's around twenty megabytes compressed and forty megabytes uncompressed, so be wary server owners; if you don't have a fast download server, this isn't a good map for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Credits:</b>\r\n\r\nMap- Me (Nubblecakes)\r\n\r\nFern Models & Monkey Flower model- From Background_Mill map\r\n\r\nPlum Tree- Stromy\r\n\r\nBrambus Model- Cheroke Team\r\n\r\n"

It's plain fight-yard stylish gameplay, except you buy weapons, and each team has a car cannon they get to use. :D\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is attack and defend. Rounds can be quick or slow depending on how people play with the traps. I'm not sure if the traps will become boring for you since a they all are duplicates of others. I think all in all there is about 6 or 7 different kinds of traps that have duplicates of themselves placed strategically around the map (if you consider senseless explosions and cars flying as a strategic thing).\r\n\r\nAnyway, you may think that the car cannon is prone to a lot of spamming, but I have a logic_timer which will remove any of the cars shot by the cannon at a 40 second interval. So every 40 seconds the cars will be randomly removed from the map. Remember, ONLY the green cars shot from either cannon. They shoot pretty fast so watch out. :D\r\n\r\nThe center pillar's base is breakable, and will make the weird shield thing at the ceiling collapse and sorta kill you all I guess (it just falls then the map explodes). There is also a little sawblade cannon that rotates slowly and lets you shoot flaming sawblades around. It won't really kill anyone though since props shot from an env_shooter entity NEVER collide with players. Too bad I can't fix that. It's just there for playing with I guess."

Don't complain that it's too dark because the idea of the Stalker gameplay is that all players have knives at the beginning of each round and must use the shadows to sneak around and ghost other players. The dark lighting in this map is exactly what you need to do this.\r\n\r\nThe map has a few glocks hidden about that you must find. Some are blatantly obvious if you have a sharp enough eye. You will have your weapons stripped at the beginning of each round in order to balance the gameplay. It would be pretty lame if you found a glock and got extra ammo the next round while everyone \r\nwho didn't only has their knives.\r\n\r\nThe map has a point_servercommand entity that functions in turning off flashlights (mp_flashlight 0). To turn it back on, simply put a 1 instead of a 0 in the parenthesized command. I disabled flashlights because it makes it boring and near-pointless to hide in the shadows if people have flashlights. If Source had the feature that actually showed the light that players casted on the map (not just the light BEAM, the actual spot of light that hits the surfaces) then I would have kept it in, but since the lighting in Source is savvy and boring, I had to remove it. I will not be removing this module, so if you want flashlights, either have an admin in the server whenever you play the map so they can set the flashlights to on, or just use Entspy to delete the point_clientcommand entity then save over the BSP. JUST DON'T UPLOAD IT HERE OR I'LL REPORT IT! You may want to give it a different name in case someone tries to join your server when they already have this map in their files. If you don't give it a different name, people with the original map will simply get \"Map differs from server.\" when they try to join. So rename it if you do this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nOriginal Map: Makkon\r\n\r\nBackground music and additional work: Nubblecakes (ME!)"

That map has the same exact layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Makkon (over at interlopers) is the original author of this map! All of the brushwork is his original work. Credit goes to him for his fantastic job. I only take credit for my additions to the map!!\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n \r\n(Can hold a max of 24 players. But I recommend 12)\r\n\r\nThe map is very dark in-game, and IT HAS LIGHTING. The reason for this dark setting is to stalk (that's where it gets its name) and try to hide from the enemy. There are many features that you can use to your advantage. There's a few light fixtures which are dynamic and can be shot out. The doors in the map will be kicked out of their foundation if you walk into them. It can go either way depending on where you enter. You really need your flashlight to navigate well, but using it exposes you more, so you want to limit the use of it. That's my only reason why I used day-time shots (the day-time version is for the ZM version of this map which is almost done). \r\n\r\nThere are many weapons hidden throughout the map which you must find. Eventually you should figure out where every gun is. If I do ever release a v2 of this, there will probably be less weapons in the map. You will lose any found weapons at the beginning of the next round though to prevent unfair advantages (EX: Guy finds an m249, and everyone else has a knife). You, of course, start out with only a knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Info:\r\n\r\nThe map has navigation but it's not perfect. The second floor is literally unnavigable for BOTS because of the sparse terrain it possesses. The nav works fine for the first floor of the map though. If you do play with BOTS, one CT point is located on the second floor so make sure to check up there every round in case a BOT decided to get stuck up there. They do manage to pick up pistols every now and then so watch out.\r\n\r\nI will be expanding this map and turning it into a ZM map. It's architecture is well-suited for ZM gameplay. \r\n\r\nThe map features an ambiance created by me. Every round it will play, but it's not looped. I hope you find it creepy."

		"_sText": "I made this map fairly quickly for the \"ThePwnd\" community Playground server. It's sort of a remake of TV Tower I guess, since that's a fairly fun map to play, but this one is far better looking and has more balanced gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the Terrorists wait at the top, and the CT have a choice of 4 elevators on the inside which they can mix up their group numbers in to try and disorient the Terrorists' judgement. The Terrorists must guess which elevator will be the most occupied. CT can choose from many combos like all in one (or if there is a lot of players, two elevators might be necessary), or a few in all.\r\n\r\nThere is also four elevators outside the tower on the corners which allow the CT to enter the Terrorists' spawn from the single vent duct at the center. This entrance is very risky since it exposes you in the middle from all sides. This is more of a last resort for CT if they have had their numbers cut drastically.\r\n\r\nThe elevators will go up and down, allowing the Terrorists to gain access to the CT spawn. I really made this in case someone wanted to be a douche and camp at the CT spawn, or if someone were AFK. That way the round wouldn't last forever.\r\n\r\nThe inner elevators will go up a second after a player steps on it. The outer elevators require a button. The only bug in this map is two of the outer elevators will operate from one button. Meaning if you press one of the elevator's button, the other elevator comes with you, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the mushroom models are from Shantytown if you are wondering. Those are the only mushrooms I used. I made the custom soundscape including the sounds it uses. I also used dynamic color correction in this map, but I don't know if it will work for you or not. I had a premade color_correction_volume entity at the T spawn that SHOULD activate a color correction file I made after compiling, but for some reason it wasn't working for me. Maybe it will for you.\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering why the walls of the fungi room are black, <b>read the Programs & Design Process paragraph.</b>"

I was watching Mythbusters and they created a chicken gun, that got me thinken, why not make a watermelon launcher, so I did.. Its pretty hard to shoot those watermelons in mid flight, so good luck :D.\r\n\r\n   theres 3 stationary targets that have audio and text when you hit certain parts of the target. Also there is 2 moving targets that go side to side and fall over when you hit em. By the front fence is a switch to bring the targets back up. A little bonus feature I decided to add was 3 cars that blow up when you shoot the red gas cans inside the car, one is hard to find :P.\r\nThe watermelon gun is quite simple theres 3 switches, Load, rotate, and fire. BTW It must be in the vert position to load it or the melons just fall behind it. You can load it all the way to the top but it gets glitchy so be warned. There some bottles on top of the hay stacks on sides by the spawn points as well. I have custom textures for the ground, mountains,some grass sprites and the switches for the watermelon gun plus I redesigned  the militia rocks for the ground. Custom Sounds for the ambient back round, cannon, car explosions ect.\r\n\r\nHave fun !"
