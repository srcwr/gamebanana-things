The way I personally view this map is something along the lines of a surf_skyscraper in that it's more about the combat than the long surf sessions. This map is really free form in that I did not create any death fields, so a player can hop from ramp to ramp at will (permitting they have the speed). Therefore, a player can chase down another for the kill.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nThe map was made entirely by me, BANORRACHY. Testing and refining suggestions were givin thanks to my clanmates. Marksticked looked at it one time really quickly for the heck of it. Sonic was my inspiration for some odd reason. And my thanks go out to Sh!zz for no reason in particular.\r\n\r\n=L= The League"

After I saw a version that Sync made, I was spurred on to retexture the map. The colors are mostly the same so that map has the same aesthetic, but the new textures provide more feedback to the surfer. \r\n\r\n  I believe this is a better version since it does not diminish the original, but enhances it. If you are unaffected by the problems many people had with the original textures, then you will remain unaffected. However, if you felt like the original textures didn't give you enough feedback while surfing, then hopefully this version will solve those problems for you.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to Sync for helping me, FalseLogic for the test server, and Nyro for the textures. Give it a try and tell me what you think. As always, I hope you enjoy it!"
