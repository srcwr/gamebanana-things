		"_sText": "STORY \r\nIn the mountains of northern Afghanistan, is a small village of stone houses nestled up against the base of a mountain. It's early spring, and the snows that cover the mountains have started melting. The stream is still covered in a layer of ice, and just after dawn on this march morning, the air is cold and foggy. The sheep huddle together on the still barren fields, and the soft thunder of the waterfall can be heard from a distance. The village appears abandoned, and the area is quiet. But Terrorists live there, where they grow poppies, and make heroin for sale in the west, and they keep the village for use as a hideout and as a factory for their profits. Unfortunately, a spy has found the village, but he was caught, and is being held hostage in the center of the village. Now, Blackhawk helicopters have landed on the southern edge of town. The Terrorists know that a rescue mission has been launched. \r\n\r\nSTRATS \r\nThe approach routes are very carefully timed so that rushes result in conflicts in specific locations. And while the layout is deceptively simple, the number of strategies you can use is almost unlimited. In particular, how you split your teams will greatly affect the game play. \r\n\r\nThe map's layout is a cyclone model with both teams spaced equidistant from the hostages, and rushing to a center arena. The village is constructed so that the terrorists come in either straight or to the high side, and the CT's either straight and to the low side. Both can flank the other team within the village, or by the ground route around the village. You can get in and out of the buildings, and easily onto the roofs, and there are at least three different ways into the village center for each team. This layout creates the effect of the teams coming out of the woodwork in a central arena, if they both sprint to the center. The teams can also try to flank the low route outside the village, and the timing is set so that smokes, flashes, and snipers all play in that tactic. \r\n\r\nMost of the routes that are interesting require you to break down a door or window, and this includes getting the hostages. The sound gives away your location. \r\n\r\nThe web site has a full list of the different strats that I used to plan the game play. "

E-Mail me at [shiroko@dune2k.com](mailto:shiroko@dune2k.com).\r\n\r\n### Version 0.2 - Beta\r\n<li> Bridge made static, I was dreaming anyway.\r\n<li> Added some clip brushes to prevent players from getting stuck in walls in the middle of firefights.\r\n<li> Bots still lag, if anyone could point a solution it would be nice.\r\n<li> Fixed some bad texture alignments.\r\n<li> Edit nav area names in radar map, sorry for the silly names, they're are limited to what's available.\r\n<li> Removed the func\\_dustmotes in the meanwhile because they were causing a bug that made all the muzzle flashes, smoke and explosions invisible.\r\n\r\n### Version 0.3 - Beta\r\n<li> Added occluders, FPS is up to 15% higher in some critical spots, but more than that I couldn't do.\r\n<li> Nav file fixed, it's not 400k instead of 2MB and fixes hostage movement (They won't dance around the garage and follow better in the woods) and also eliminates the bot lag. Bots can now be added freely (Well, as free as in any other map) and they now know the paths to all hostages and the path from the overpass (Though, they're don't seem to use it)\r\n<li> Fixed the rocks that were standing in air on the ledge of the cliff\r\n<li> Blocked some areas that let you get on the cliffs (Special thanks to games for finding some weird spots)\r\n<li> Added an Easter egg, as a signature for people that get the map without a readme.\r\n<li> Fixed some invalid CT spawns, map not officially supports 40 players (If anyone actually manages to get so much players on a server, I'd like a mail about that)\r\n<li> Fixed some points of awful mapping techniques, nothing you'll notice but took down vis time for compiling and I think it's more fair in the balance of things...\r\n\r\n### Version 0.4 - Last Beta?\r\n<li> Nav file improvements, bots still don't use overpass (They know it, but unless following a human, they don't like this path), Hostages problems solved a little, but seems no matter what I'll do you have to wait and give them time to catch, as they simply cannot keep in pace with a player, otherwise they preform good (Just make sure you give them a sec to figure when they need to jump).\r\n<li> Clipped some odd areas once more, and all the horizontal trees so you can stand on them.\r\n<li> Made the invisible blocks less apparent, APC in CT spawn and a tree to block some of the river passage\r\n<li> Overview added for the 3 people that might actually use it, the rest now have to download an extra 1.3M cause of the overview texture.\r\n<li> Fixed a bug where one CT spawn was outside the buy zone\r\n\r\n### Version 1.0 - Final release (Or is it?)\r\n<li> Fixed a lot of plants that were actually hovering.\r\n<li> Made the beam in the T Spawn stairs illusionary, so you can get stuck in it.\r\n<li> Added a cubemap for the APC\r\n<li> Rounded one of the rough cliffs.\r\n<li> A few other pointless things.\r\n<li> Unless something critical happens to this release this would be final one. If you still want to comment, you're welcome, it'll just have less of an effect like that.\r\n\r\n### A few basic strategies to keep in mind:\r\n<li> Move slowly in the forests unless you're in a rush, it's very easy to miss people hiding in the shadows.\r\n<li> Which points the next thing, use the shadows and the bushes in the jungle, don't move on the road in the middle. You can frequently kill someone from behind because he passed you without noticing\r\n<li> Terrorists have a camping advantage, if they use it the CTs can always use the overpass for sniping them (Use the area with the bushes, not the exposed area, it is meant only to avoid damage when going down)\r\n<li> When sniping hide in foliage and don't move, moving is the most exposing thing. (Until someone saw you, then you better move if you don't want to get hit)\r\n<li> If you go for hostages, try letting two people get them, each from one house. This will simplify bringing them back. Remember there are two Hostage rescues, so if you suspect someone camping the rescue, go to the farther one.\r\n\r\nAll models and textures were created by me, but can be used by any other mapper for his map freely. As long that he doesn't make any profit of this work. In the later case, E-Mail me at shiroko@dune2k.com for resolving the issue.\r\nAlso in both cases, credit should still be given to me.\r\nIn case anyone wants the source file of the art he's welcome to E-Mail me (Again, [shiroko@dune2k.com](mailto:shiroko@dune2k.com))\r\n\r\nThe following textures are not original work, and therefore are free for any use:\r\n<li> dirt01, mud01, cliff05a, cliff05b, grass01.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOmer Sturlovich<br>\r\nShiroko<br>\r\n[shiroko@dune2k.com](mailto:shiroko@dune2k.com)<br>"

I must test it on other cpu's and see if it is because my cpu sucks or it is just too much for the source engine. xD Tell me your opinion and fps while the wall is breaking (if possible) and your cpu specs (ghz and number of cores). thanks guys!"
