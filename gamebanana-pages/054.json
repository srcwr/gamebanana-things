At the top of the tower you can shoot the vent so you drop down. (No hp lose because of water). Then you just can shoot down the walls at the end so you can pass in like 4 directions.\r\nIn general it's just a really simple gungame map.\r\n\r\nAnd now I just want your opinions about it.\r\nI'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nGrtz Jens "

The map isn't designed to be looked at from outside the map, and the sky didn't come out that great.  Also, I did what I did with complex by taking pictures of my TV and converting it to a vtf format for game usage.  Some of the textures are great, some are horrible.  \r\n\r\nThe map has hostages, but to move them you need to add a bot to create the .nav file.  bot_add_t  or something.  The rescue points are the ct spawns and under the bridges (push off the hosties to win).  Also, be careful on your jumps on this map, because you will take damage jumping down to just about anywhere.  Especially on the bridges... or beneath them...  I didn't use a map protector on this map, so if you want to know how to do trains with sky textures you can decompile it.

It isn't perfect, but you'll definitely feel like you're playing complex when you play this map.\r\n\r\nThe map was originally a DM map, but I changed it to a GG/DE map.  I didn't add DE to the name, it's meant for my clan servers (one of the mods of which is Gun Game, thus the GG).  It is a bomb map with two bomb sites.  Buy zones for both teams, I added stealth bombers that circle around the map for kicks.\r\n\r\nIf I feel like it, I'll make later versions for DM and I'll use the map for surf_oblivionarena and call it surf_oblivioncomplex.\r\n\r\nFind a bug?  Leave feedback.  Need a version?  Leave feedback.  \r\n\r\nEDIT1:  I'm going to do some revisions on this.  Apparently there are some purple textures in the map (hearing mixed feedback on this, so I'm not fully sure).  Also, I'm going to release a new map that is smaller for the purpose of gun game.  I will leave this map under the de section and rename it to a DE map later.  I also have to add more direction (bomb sites, etc.).\r\n\r\nEDIT2:  Cancel that.  I think I've done everything right (except I could have used better names for my custom textures) but whatever.  As for a shrunk version I'm not going to do it.  Not in the mood of renaming it either.  And if you guys beg me I can try a DM version (or if someone wants to make a DM version, you can ask me for the vmf)."
