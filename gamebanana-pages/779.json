Its architecture fascinated me, and therefore I decided to try and make a Counter-Strike map around it. \r\n\r\nThe hall has been reconstructed using pictures and a sketch (see screenshots, note: drawing not made by me). The area around it is purely fictional and adjusted to fit a CS Counter-strike map.\r\n\r\nIt is currently in development and halfway done (T-side done, CT side just a box :P). The roof is still to come as well. See the development tab above for more pictures and the whole process. \r\n\r\nIt has been uploaded for testing and fun, to let the public see the map, test it and tell me what I can improve :)\r\n\r\nIt is made for max 20 players (10vs10, obviously), but it has not yet been fully optimized in brushwork and VISleafs (for those who know what I mean), I cannot guarantee optimal fps in large groups. In addition, it works nicely in 3vs3ish as well.\r\n\r\nKnown bugs at the moment: \r\n# In the secret passage vent from the storage room to the upstairs office, people can have problems climbing the stairs and jumping from it. Face the stairs, press crouch and jump to get there.\r\n# When 1vs1 Bot remain after a while (T bot camping the Hostage Rescue zone and CT bot rescuing the hostages, they might get stuck and look at a wall for a few minutes before continuing to their confrontation. \r\n# Lag problems due to no complete optimization\r\n\r\nHave fun testing and debugging. :D"

Also in a near by house they have\r\nHacked central stations CCTV cameras and have rigged\r\nUp a monitor overlooking the station, although \r\nConnection is not 100% clear, it should aid in\r\nLocating any suspects\r\n\r\nRescue points are located at central stations\r\nSubway exit and outside near the northern petrol\r\nPumps, safely navigate hostages to the parked vans\r\n\r\nEmail: nayisdeath@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n..:: Overview\r\n\r\nCs_central started out in March 2006, And ive\r\nbeen on and off with the project, initally it was\r\nmeant to be a rebuild of an old 1.6 map known as\r\ncs_intercept but after some thought I changed it \r\ninto what is now known as cs_central.\r\nIt was meant to be a piece of art at first, it was a test\r\nto see what i could do with the source engine, but after\r\nconstructing a major part of the bridge and station \r\n( which is based on a true place where i live )\r\nI then decided to try and make it into something playable \r\nwith reasonable frame rates.\r\n\r\nThe train bridge and passing road and the station itself are \r\nall based around the real place but the petrol station in real\r\nlife is just an old long distant car park looking over the town.\r\n\r\nThe beach area is a large outdoor area with a bus station,\r\nWhen i started the project it was acutally the back of the shopping centre\r\nwhich has recently recieved millions of pounds of rebuilding work \r\nto make it into a 21st century bus station\r\n\r\nand the edge of the road in cs_central which points in the direction of the\r\nold cottage near the petrol station runs to the rubgy stadium.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t..:: DETAILED MAP INFORMATION\r\n\r\n: \tThe map comes with LDR and HDR cubemaps compiled.\r\n: \tRadar Overview.\r\n: \tHighly Tuned Bot Navigation File.\r\n: \tAll Custom content is embedded into the BSP. ( 68.4mb )\r\n: \tThe map has a point_servercommand to allow servers to automatically\r\n  \tlet users download the map.\r\n:\tThe dynamic camera does seem to make users loose a fair bit of performance\r\n\twhen running around, once it is destroyed it returns to normal\r\n:\tThe Stations toilets can be entered, \r\n:\tOverhead powerlines are Electrical So dont touch them when jumping \r\n\ton top of the parked train.\r\n:\tLightmaps are only Lower on the station, rest of the map are \r\n\tgenerally higher than default.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t..:: Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to Valve, I used there Coke machine from de_nuke.\r\nPlus The custom soundscape i used in cs_central is built around \r\nserveral of the official maps, including assault/port/office and train\r\n\r\n\t\t\t..:: Performance\r\n\r\nI know the map is not amazing in terms of performance, This is \r\nbecause i didnt plan the map very well from the begining as explained above\r\nbut i believe it gets as good as it can for whats being rendered.\r\nI spent various amounts of weeks hinting and using areaportals and window portals\r\nto optimize the map, and using nodraw and func_detail."

IF anyone knows of a better texture that could be used, or for that matter better textures to be use ANYWHERE in the map, let me know, I will gladly change any textures in the map if i think it will look better\r\n\r\n**Hostages are ALWAYS in the way and dieing, sometimes its funny sometimes its annoying, if anyone has some ideas that will help get them out of the way? even just deleting them and making it a skill map? Once again open to anything =)\r\n\r\n**Try to get the hostages out 2 at a time (its pretty impossible to get them all out at once before everyone is dead)\r\n\r\nmax player = 18 (it's too crowded with more than that and people spawn on top of each other) I could add more if its wanted.\r\n\r\nthat being said . . . I'm quite open to ALL feedback (preferably constructive) adding entrances and exits and this and that here and there is no problem so please tell me what to do!\r\n\r\nIF theres anything i missed putting into this please tell me, if i think you can help me I will give the .VMF(T?) out on request, please help me make it better! or at least make my next one better\r\n\r\nwo woo pan"

There are many different passageways, and lots of different strategies to use. The bridge down the middle can be quick escape, but there is no cover from many sniping spots. Sometimes the games can last quite a while with all the different routes (especially if the bots get stuck in the water). There are two ladders to get out of the water on the wall of the little  platforms that stick out from the side, and another two vines to climb up on closer to the center (all vines are climable on this map). The hostage rescue point is the top floor of the side that the Counter-Terrorists spawn on. That rope like thing is also climable, but the AI seems to just disregard it. Overall it is a great map for medium/large size groups."

After all, cs-calm-source was itself a quick remake of my map cs-calm for CS 1.6 from 2003. It actually helped me get back to business after I stopped mapping for almost 7 years. \r\n\r\nMany people also indicated that the map needs some adjustments and more details; so after releasing de-spezia last month, I went back to cs-calm-source and what actually started as slight modification ended up as redesigning and rebuilding around 70% of the map from scratch :)\r\n\r\nNew areas and routes were added, old layout was heavily modified; textures, lighting and props were completely replaced and the overall map area was slightly increased to ensure smoother gameplay.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the map is fully optimized to ensure fluid gameplay and consistent high FPS.\r\n\r\nThe map has:\r\n\r\n- 32 spawn points (16 vs 16) I considered 64 spawn points but I think it would be too much for the size of the map.\r\n- radar overview\r\n- 3D skybox\r\n- Soundscapes\r\n- custom textures and models\r\n- Nav file with place names\r\n\r\nAll the custom resources (except the nav) are embedded in the bsp.\r\n\r\nFor installation, simply extract the 4 files in the zip archive (bsp, nav and 2 txt files) to your \\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really hope you enjoy this map as much as I did creating and testing it.\r\nComments and constructive feedback are always welcome.\r\n\r\nWill2k\r\n\r\nOctober 22, 2011"

		"_sText": "Another quality map i never made, not sure why this has never been uploaded before or if it has why was it removed its great\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of CS_Cabaret is that a group of Terrorists have taken control of a gentlemens club, while taking a few hostages at the same time. Its up to the Counter-Terrorists to break in and save the day. Theres quite a few entrances on all different sides of the club, allowing both quick entry and quick exit for both teams while providing both outdoor long range combat and indoor CQB action.\r\n\r\nCabaret has been heavily balanced and fine tuned to make sure that no team has a clear advantage, and that each team has equal opportunities at victory. Through countless hours of playtesting with both humans and bots, the map has proved to be amazingly balanced for a assault-styled map.\r\n\r\nThe custom hostage models included with the map are strippers, as it definetly suites the map more than the original (and boring) worker hostages. Theres also a ton of custom textures, models and sounds which are completely new, so it definetly gives the map a unique look and feel which is unlike any other map around. The downside of all the custom content is that t he filesize of the map grows considerably. The materials, models and sounds account for about 20mb out of the 60mb bsp, while almost all the rest of the filesize is due to HDR lighting (it nearly triples the filesize). Its good to use new technology, though. I also spent alot of time making sure that the map was balanced for each side, allowing fair and maybe even competitive gameplay. I tested the map with both human players and bots for balance, and after lots of tweaking, the map eventually became even.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of bots, there is a heavily tweaked .nav file included in the map which I created almost from the ground up, which will make those with unstable internet connections happy as the bots preform quite well around the map. The only issue which I couldent figure out a way to fix (but did manage to lessen its occurrence) was how the bots interact with doors. Sometimes theyll get caught on the door and wait for a few seconds before managing to get by. Since the hostages also use the .nav file aswell, they run around very well and will rarely get stuck on anything (unless you decide to lead them through the entire building while running as fast as possible).\r\n\r\nRecomended Players: 6-20 Maximum: 40"
