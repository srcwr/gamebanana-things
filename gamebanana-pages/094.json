The map currently has our founders tags on a rotating cube in the center, as well as large version of our clan logo.  There is also one painting with my Steam ID tag inserted.\r\n\r\nThe art gallery is a maze setup, while the front and rear sections are straight through sniping zones.   The large upper atrium area is a shoot'em out section with only sparse cover.  The atrium also has jump down access into the gallery.\r\n\r\nQuestions remain on whether the map is too big for gungame.  We could remove any combination of the front, rear or atrium areas."
