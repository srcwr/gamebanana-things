Their new aim is to do as much damage as possible using \"Clashpoints\" under some of the area's buildings.\r\n\r\nThere are two clashpoints on this map:\r\n1) There is a clashpoint in a small office close to the Docklands tower. This is located at the base of the Canary Wharf building.\r\n2) There is a warehouse that hosts a lot of documents to which could also be destroyed in order to bring about a long financial halt. This could also be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs with any \"de_\" map, the terrorists are the ones with the explosives, the the counter-terrorists are out to stop them.\r\n\r\nI've also added a secret access area which has reasonable access from both terrorists and counter terrorists. It's not very obvious, but it's quite rewarding. If you manage to find this out then you can tell me about it, studio@sixdimensional.com - well done."

The most impressive feature of this map is it's TWO HUNDRED spawn points (half and half) leaving the possibility for MASSIVE multiplayer battles.  The army of terrorists have one goal-- bomb the massive gate built into the fortress wall, while the counter terrorists must use all means to prevent the bomb from going off.  Terrorists have lots of cover from the oppressive firepower raining down from the looming walls.  CT's have two sniping bunkers to use and also have massive boulder defenses which can be released to crush approaching enemies.  \r\n\r\nThis map was a lot of work for me. Not sure how many hours, but it was a lot more than de_fireinthehole (it is my second map, so im still learning, but I think it's pretty good) ;)  \r\n\r\nSpread the word about the 200 player capability and hopefully we'll see some HUGE games in the near future (on servers that can handle it!!!!)"
