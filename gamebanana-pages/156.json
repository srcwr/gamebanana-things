I believe this is the first escape map which has Italian styled environment and buildings. Named it after Sorrento, an Italian coastal village near Napoli where my mother used to live. Easy name to remember....\r\nBut it's construction is inspired upon Scheveningen. A coastal town in Holland with a huge pier and boulevard. But I thought it would be nice to have an Italian styled environment in an escape map since they are more exciting to build then Dutch buildings. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* 64 spawnplaces\r\n* 5 different routes to the end\r\n* including 1 SECRET route\r\n* 3D-Skybox\r\n* My trademark: \r\n   a building which holds grenades and guns\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n- i3D.net for their great servers and because I am admin on it \r\n- Salem from i3D for putting up my maps and being a great support\r\n- Skaelman for helping and solving my 3d-skybox problem\r\n- Many others, including the people I see in servers and on my Steam friendlist\r\n\r\nROGER GARGANTUA \r\n\r\naka GARGANTUA[i3D]\r\n\r\nMap changes in version 5 ( ze_sorrento_escape_v5 )\r\n- Less barrels \r\n- higher crates at seadome tower\r\n- minor changes here and there"

In this version, I've added some more running to the start of the map, so that the map will now also be fun in servers with a longer time before the first infection.\r\n\r\nI didn't remove the v2 from FSPB because it is still playable. This version can be used in all servers, but I have made it especially for servers that have set time until first infection to 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: v2\r\n- Changed the end of the map. It was too hard to defend and you could get hit by the nuke even when inside the area.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start with, this map is not about the looks, but about the gameplay. I can't guarantee you that it will be fun, but I sure hope so. My intention was to create a map in which the survivors have to defend and run. I tried to make the spots that they have to defend not too easy to get into by the zombies. Therefore the defendable spots on the way to the end should be fairly easy to defend. The end should however be balanced :). If you find any bugs, please report them to me. Also if you have any comments, feel free to leave them here :)."

Having reached abydos you have to get some C4 outside the pyramid. while you run back into the pyramid and plant the c4 the others have to cover your back at the entrance until the door closed. Then you rush back into the catacombs of the pyramid until you get back into the gate room with daniels stone tablett and escape with the ring transporter system to a save goa uld mothership.\r\n\r\nMission Stargatecenter:\r\nThe Zombie race is coming through the gate. To hold them back you try to close the iris but it doesnt hold them off long. Run into an elevator and make your way til the generator where someone has to jump in and overheat it by this. Officially he dies by jumping in but you \"respawn\" as a survivor in another room where the others have to free you. with you the replicator disruptor :). Run faster and get outside by repairing the final elevator before the whole complex explodes.\r\n\r\nWeapons:\r\n\r\nSGC Mission: Replicator disruptor\r\nDamage: 200 per second\r\nLasts: 2 seconds\r\nSpecial: backboost for zombs\r\nCooldown: 20 sec\r\nUsage: rightclick\r\n\r\nAbydos Mission: Zat nikitel\r\nDamage: NONE\r\nLasts: 5 seconds\r\nSpecial: Stun for zombies\r\nCooldown: 20 sec\r\nUsage: rightclick\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- 2 incredible missions with special weapons and high detail.\r\n- nice fps\r\n- radar\r\n- 64 spawns\r\n- 2 separate spawns of which one divides into 2 again. so very nice balance at start.\r\n- missions activate randomly every round.\r\n- 1:1 stargate dialing sequence as in the movie.\r\n- working ring transporter system as in the movie.\r\n- usable zat\r\n- usable replicator disruptor\r\n- and pretty more stuff like many custom models etc.\r\n\r\nHave Fun.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\n\r\nFreeZe"

Anyway this time added much bigger heli so it takes off proper and added more custom content, including 4 player models as dead npc's from the upcoming Halo:Source mod (Link <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/6197\">here</a> ). Anyway added some new traps  and most importantly added another alternate route to the top of the buildings! So if you miss the heli you still can go through the emergency door located at the back of the heli area, you cant miss it, the door has radiation signs all over it =-p. \r\n\r\nAnyway if you find any more bugs or glitches plz pm me and I will either put up a patch here, or if its HUGE, ill make <i>another</i> new version o_0...\r\n\r\nOld Post:\r\n\r\nOkay so after extensive bug testing and testing it online I have decided to realese this version of runaway. This version fixes several bugs and glitches such as:\r\n-Water not rendering\r\n-Being able to glitch of map at gas station\r\n-Being able to glitch of map at back buildings\r\n-House with steps now has breakable wall (old one wasnt cliped far enough)\r\n-Filled in empty glitch spot for nuke\r\n-Ect\r\n\r\nThis version also includes several new enhancments such as\r\n-Alternate heli board point!\r\n-Several new secrets\r\n-Removed easy buttons and placed harder ones so prevention of secret spammers\r\n-Uberkirsche gun prefab as a secret\r\n-Hidden wall door\r\n-Ect.\r\n\r\nSo hopefully this version will be much better with way fewer bugs to be found. Hope you like the new content (if you can get to it =-p).\r\n\r\nOriginal post from old, old map:\r\n\r\nFinally got this finished. It includes rogergargantua's original map runaway2 (link: <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/48435\">here</a>) and extended it and added a secret room, which you can see in one of the screenies. Anyway added a heli and everything, few custom sounds ect. Please dl and put it on your servers!\r\n\r\nBTW I had gargantuas permision for this map. Just so you know.\r\n\r\nFor people with fast dl servers, the .bz2 files go on your fast dl server while the normal .bsp goes on your server."

A lot easier to shoot zombies off.\r\n- Replaced the boxes at the end escape point.\r\n- different lighting ( changed settings in the light_sun entity ). It now has more of a sunset light.\r\n- Added one secret spot which has some grenades lying. \r\n\r\nStory: After you and your military team got away with the train ( ze_rooftop_runaway 1 ) you arrived at the city's trainstation. Some roofs at the station have collapsed because of the airstrike and the trainrails are now blocked. You have no choice now but to go back in to what's left of the city and get to the secure high grounds. \r\n\r\nObjective: You are part of the military and your objective is to get back into the city.
