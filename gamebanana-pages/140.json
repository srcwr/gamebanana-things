Basicly, the maps are different parts of a giant facility, this part will be the office part of the facility, where the people who have no idea whats going on below work.\r\nThe other parts will be a recycling facility, Labs, Chemical storage, and power.\r\n\r\nI will also modify the maps to be playable in Hl2 single player mode.\r\nthese will be the map names:\r\n\r\nInfiltration (lvl1)\r\nGreenhouse (lvl2)\r\nNightmare (lvl3)\r\nUnder the Rug (lvl4)\r\nNight light (lvl5)\r\nEscape (lvl1 modifyed)\r\n\r\nThe best part of this map that I think is the secret. \r\n\r\nthe secret is a safe room where no zombie can possibly get to you.

It's also a good idea to explore the map before playing because there are lots of secret places."

I used a new lighting technique I've been absolutely dying to try out, and I think it came out really nice. The interiors of both buildings are covered in decals and barricading areas, while the outside receives the nighttime lighting and plenty of areas to climb. This is a beta version, and there's no 3D skybox as I didn't get around to making one yet, but you can be sure that it will be included in the next release, so please try not to complain too much again that.\r\n\r\nAs always, feel free to express your own opinion about the map!\r\nI'd love to hear what players have to say. ^_^\r\nIt's been a while since I've gotten around to releasing a map on FPSB. =D\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho"

Don't let the time I spent on this map fool you though, as I worked very hard on this one.\r\n\r\nThere's two main areas to the map. First, there's an aboveground area with a radio tower of sorts in the middle of a storage yard. This area involves a lot of climbing and some barricading. Additionally, there's an underground office-type area filled with barricadeable rooms. This way both parties are pleased, and there's plenty of places to support up to 32 players, though 24 is probably ideal.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone asks, I created this from scratch with little to no reference material. That being said, I think both areas look pretty realistic and came out quite well. And yes, there is at least one secret to be found. ^_^\r\n\r\nOh, and before I forget, check out my gaming community @ <a href=\"http://www.ke0.us/\">www.ke0.us</a>! We have this map running on our ZombieMod server if you'd ever like to test it out.\r\n\r\nIf anyone ever feels like making a remake of this map, that's fine, but please contact me before you release it and be sure to include my name in the credits as the original creator of the map as I have here.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, thanks for downloading and enjoy the map! =D"
