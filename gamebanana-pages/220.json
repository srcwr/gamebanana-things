It looks good and I think everything works good too! You have only a knife on this map.\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n\r\nYou are a Ninja! Yes you are! On spawn you can choose your skill and after 30 seconds everybody'll be teleported to an arena.\r\n\r\n**Classes:**\r\n\r\nRunning Ninja.\r\n\r\n- Fast (80 hp)\r\n- Very Fast (60 hp)\r\n- Fast Like Hell (15 hp)\r\n\r\nShy Ninja.\r\n\r\n- Gravity - (80 hp)\r\n- Gravity - - (60 hp)\r\n- Gravity - - - (15 hp)\r\n\r\nFat Ninja.\r\n\r\n- Slow (135 hp)\r\n- Very Slow (200 hp)\r\n\r\nNudist Ninja.\r\n\r\n- Stealth + (80 hp)\r\n- Stealth + + (60 hp)\r\n\r\nJunior Ninja.\r\n\r\n- Normal (100 hp)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"

Maybe I can get around to doing that in v3... I was kind of aiming for the look of Utah beach, but I failed at that and now it looks like something you'd find in a snowglobe...
