Changed the textures of some blocks.\r\nEDIT3:Added a playerclip near the secret AWP so people can not fall off.\r\nChanged the Citadel 'change' activation area. Now it activates at the end castle.\r\nAdded env-sprites.\r\nRemoved Citadel Explosion.\r\nChanged the skybox, and placed the sun in a new area accordingly.\r\nChanged the sun/env-enviroment color.\r\nChanged teleports so that they teleport to random locations rather than just one.\r\nAdded new console messages to facilitate actions.\r\nAdded portal effect on top of citadel.\r\nAdded thumpers around the landscape to force people to run around them.\r\nChanged some music to fit players' request.\r\nChanged the water texture in some areas.\r\nChanged the timer for the teleport at the second Combine Access Wall.\r\nChanged name of map to avoid a map error.\r\n\r\nVERSION 3:\r\nRemoved the 'portal spire' and added the Citadel (THAT MOVES) instead. Added a sound that goes off when the citadel moves.\r\nAdded a 'surprise' at the end.\r\nAdded random props along the running areas to slow people down.\r\nCreated teleport occasions that bring the zombies closer to humans.\r\nThe strider has proper animations now.\r\nAdded a thumper with animations.\r\nFixed some lights.\r\nRemoved rain and fires to improve frame-rates.\r\nReduced file size.\r\nChanged some music to reflect players' interest.\r\n\r\nA SMALL UPDATE:\r\nFixed the open displacements.\r\n\r\nVERSION 2:\r\nAdded another hold area.\r\nAdded walls to make the map smaller/less open space.\r\nIncreased the trigger times on the bridge(now you have to hold for longer).\r\nLovely Cube maps are back.\r\nThe map is only 5 mb larger in real space, but the zip file is only 1 mb larger (if not less.)\r\nAdded a door that opens when you get to the castle.\r\nChanged the inner door at the bridge so that it starts closed.\r\nAdded a button to open the door at the front of the bridge. (You have to hold while it opens, then run it to close it.)\r\n\r\nORIGINAL TEXT:\r\nMake your way through the strange blend of old and new so you can survive!\r\nThis is my first map! Hopefully, it will be worth the download.\r\nIN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING:\r\nCaptain Cliche created the landscape, objectives, water, 3d skybox and main buildings. I fixed nearly every error in the map, added the tower in the 3d skybox (as well as the portal effect and the lasers) changed the textures of things, added more console messages,created the teleporter boxes, changed the variables of certain entities  (such as the door closing times), removed the fog present in the original map, added music and random song choosers, fixed the path-chooser entity, removed and added rubble, and many other things."

You must run, drive, and shoot your way to freedom through a pristine jungle habitat where every creature is a threat and every man a meal. Welcome to the food chain.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Open ended environment. Unlike other escape maps, there are no unnatural perfectly square corridors that confine you to a very small area. Run in any direction at your own discretion.\r\n\r\n-Drivable Mobile Command Center. Improve your chances of survival by commandeering the abandoned RV at the hunter's camp, but don't let it sink!\r\n\r\n-Dynamic spawn location. You have just twenty seconds to flee from a falling plane before it crashes and burns, with you in it!\r\n\r\n-Dynamic, deadly predators. I'm not just talking about the zombies, either. The local inhabitants have a fondness for human flesh, and they have the teeth and claws to help appease that huge appetite of theirs.\r\n\r\n-Powerful electric fences left over from the failed Site B experiment.\r\n\r\n-Ambient wildlife, sounds, and theme music.\r\n\r\n-Multiple routes to the embryonic research compound.\r\n\r\n-Custom built V-22 Osprey VSTOL by Butterknife.\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n\r\nIsla Sorna, 0300 Zulu:\r\n\r\nShortly after the Nublar incident, Peter Ludlow acquired control of the inGen Corporation. The ruthless nephew of John Hammond, Ludlow is bent on turning the previously failed experiment of prehistoric genesis into a profitable enterprise. InGen hunters have already been dispatched to Isla Sorna to gather specimen for the new JP: San Diego amusement park.\r\n\r\nBiosyn has sent a contingent of mercenaries to hamper InGen's expedition to Site B. As a merc, your mission was to perform a HALO insertion at base camp-however disaster struck when your transport's right wing was torn asunder from a tropical storm. Your only hope is to reach the embryo research compound further inland to signal the nearby U.S. fleet for a search and rescue.\r\n\r\nYou will most likely be put on trial upon your return.

Right click is his \"Fus Ro Dah\" shout (Pushes zombies very far, 80 sec cooldown).\r\n- Level 3 \"Archmage\": Left click shoots a ball of electricity (Pushes and damages zombies, 9 sec cooldown). Right click works like a flamethrower (Damages,puts zombies on fire and slows them down for 6 seconds, 60 sec cooldown)\r\n- Level 4 \"Daedric\": Left click is melee attack (Pushes and damages zombies). Right click for his \"Nuke\" (Deals 20k damage in a fairly big radius to zombies, 60 sec cooldown and only 2 uses)\r\n\r\nAll the Human items **SECONDARY ATTACK** deals damage to the final boss, it is up to you if you want to use them.\r\n\r\nZombie items:\r\n------------- \r\n- Level 1 \"Werewolf\": Left click for melee attack(Deals damage to humans,2 sec cooldown).

		"_sText": "This map is something I have been working for about 40 days now, on and off. I started 'strong' and got the visuals done in about two weeks, along with the interesting entities, and then did the boring bunch of things later.\r\n\r\nThe map is set on an tropical island -called Isla Bonita- somewhere near something, perhaps in central/south America. It is composed by two acts (which I tried to make different in terms of feel, dunno if I achieved it). \r\n\r\nI made the map with the intention of hosting a global server contest (like I already did with paper escaper but without being a bitch and actually rewarding people). Because of this, when the beta testing period is over (two weeks should be fine for it?) I will upload a new version with the proper contest billboards and everything being explained on them.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay should be stealth-styled, meaning you have to infiltrate and unlock doors/things while the rest of the team holds. The map is probably a bit too hard at this point (but I don't believe it is broken hard, just a bit different and therefore harder by the general effect of new-things-that-people-have-to-learn). The first act is doable in 9 minutes (in fact, on a perfect run, 7:30 minutes would do fine, perhaps 7:45). The second act shouldn't be affected by round time because timings don't depend that much on players.\r\n\r\nIt is a perfect streak map. That is, once you fail, you go back to the beginning. Think of it as a very long round. I know it can be annoying and bother some (and I wasn't fully sure of doing it until I kept testing and testing it), but I believe this can keep the map interesting without relying on an absurd number of long, half assed levels.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are not too good in my opinion, specially lighting. On these terms, I recommend every player to enable color corrections (mat_colorcorrection 1) because the map came out a bit too bright. We will see how/in which terms does this change.\r\n\r\nFinally, the map is the first to feature a score system, at least in Zombie Escape. The map will keep track of your progress and, upon being beaten, will output a number in the range 0-255 that will be your final score. I suspect the score might be a bit unbalanced on this beta version (perhaps you can't get more than 150~ points because I left by accident a few things out). This, however, will be fixed for the contest/upcoming versions, so you can at least get a taste of it at the moment. The map will also output your score in terms of the state of the mission, time consumed to fulfill the mission and number of tries to fulfill the mission.\r\n\r\nThe map features:\r\n\r\n- Two acts\r\n- Score system\r\n- Overwrittable config system (the map forces configs but server admins can overwrite them if they find them to be too much - only the one forced by the server will be considered valid [YES IT DISABLES YOUR FUCKING ICE/LIGHT NADES - DEAL WITH IT])\r\n- C4 Bombs\r\n- A terrible story that doesn't help at all written by a non-native speaker\r\n- Color corrections and color correction based dynamic effects\r\n- Particles\r\n- Hacking\r\n- Pew pewing\r\n- Stealth styled gameplay\r\n- Radar (I fucked up a bit, but nothing too serious)\r\n- No item copypaste\r\n- A cinema\r\n- Secrets\r\n- More pew pewing\r\n- Y CAN'T METROID CRAWL!!!!!!!1!11\r\n\r\nYou are allowed to do as you please with the map, decompile, open it and ruin it or shove it up your ass. I don't mind if you claim it as yours, if you think you created whatever the fuck you want to get from it or whatever. You didn't. And I didn't either, I just made some entities work together over an engine that is open enough to let me do it. It would be nice, however, to at least mention that you didn't fully do it (but please, don't mention me at all ever).\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOn a side note: while testing the map we noticed it is specially suited for co-op gameplay and training modes. As so, the upcoming versions will, hopefully (if entities aren't a bitch, which is something I am afraid of as of now) have a training mode. Said mode will have regeneration areas and ammo refills (and will be meant for playing with friends in LAN/through Hamachi).\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nb2 changes:\r\n\r\n- Changed a few teleports (they enable later)\r\n- Elevator vent @ Act I breaks 2 seconds later\r\n- Warehouse hold takes 5 seconds less\r\n- Cave hold takes a bit less\r\n- Added a floor marker with caution textures so people hold and only a few go into the vent. It's not really needed since they shouldn't run like little bitches and people would learn the way in the long run, but whatever.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nb3 changes:\r\n\r\n- Changed the first teleport to avoid zombie hunting.\r\n- Fixed a broken displacement near the first area\r\n- Fixed the last teleport in Act II that wouldn't work at all\r\n- Tweaked the score system a bit, now it would be quite close to the contest version's score system\r\n- Minor visual tweaks\r\n- Added a guide to get to the penisgun somewhere in/on/under/through the map\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe contest version (v1) has been released. It hasn't changed much, although I've done a few balance tweaks here and there and fixed a few issues (let's hope for the shake of it that I didn't fuck up while doing so). The contest, as explained in the webpage I've set up for it (<a href=\"http://taboocarnation.tk \"http://taboocarnation.tk\"\">http://taboocarnation.tk</a>) will depend on the score you get when you with both levels in a perfect streak; however, I'll take into account how well played the map was. To measure everything, I'll need both levels being demo'd (I know it can be a hassle, but hey...). Another submission requirement will be to send the complete player list and a few other thingies (the score, temporal satisfaction grade, etc...).\r\n\r\nAdmin help is not allowed, and there have to be at least 30 players playing (spectators are, as so, not counted).\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe final (I hope so) version (v2) has been released. Aside from edict optimizations, the contest winner billboards and the cvar system nothing else has changed. For servers that would rather play the map in a casual fashion, I'd recommend using the two following cvars:\r\n\r\n- taboo_extra_tries_enable \r\n- taboo_items_enable \r\n\r\nThey will enable both 5 tries on the second act (instead of going directly back to the first act; this will, however, imply a penalty points-wise) and the map items (which feature a medikit, an ammo box, explosive landmines and an experimental deathray)."

Do not worry, with the included tutorial level, you will get your head around the basics in no time!\r\n\r\nStory\r\nFor some reason, you are in a facility where they only way to escape is through surfing and defending!\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n-Automatic map settings! No need for admin to change any accelerations!\r\n-A TUTORIAL LEVEL for new players to get their head around surfing in no time!\r\n-NO FALL DAMAGE! \r\n-Fell of the surfing block? Get tele'd back to your last checkpoint and try again!\r\n-Teleport campers and people who didnt finish a surfing stage, so you get to carry on!\r\n-Random route is chosen, so show your abilities in a varied surfing way!\r\n-Up to 12 combinations of route! (3 and 4)\r\n-Carefully design defense areas\r\n-Open minded defense area, with up to 5 different holding places, so spread out!\r\n-King of the hill style defense \r\n-Corridor defense area. Team work and shooting coordination required!\r\n-10,000 hp for zombies who finish final surf in less than 15 seconds after the first humans finish!\r\n-Can you get a surf board? ( replaces deagle, you need ot throw before hand).\r\n-5 second afker killer. 5 seconds for those who who do not need afk killer because people like to respawn\r\n-PLAYTESTED!

If you have version z then you're fine, zz is just  a small balance update.  ZZ just changes the teleport secret to the new shuttle, and makes it harder to figure out.  It wasn't fair to humans when zombies could teleport on top of them.  Now it's a much more difficult secret.</font>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#4444FF\" face=\"helvetica\"><b>ze_space_stationzz\r\n\r\nNote:  This is released with the permission of JJ45 and Archanor, the original creators of this map.  Zekeus co-authored this with me as well, but I'm the one uploading it here.</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless there are bugs or something, this will be the FINAL version of ze_space_station, at least that I make.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n64 Players\r\nRadar\r\nCubemaps\r\nNav File\r\nCustom Textures\r\n4 Minor Secrets\r\n3 Medium Secrets\r\n1 Insane Death Secret\r\n3 Escape Shuttles\r\n2 Main Routes\r\n\r\nThis version here was made to correct two problems...  First of all on a respawn server, players would get killed by the nuke, then respawn.  Then they'd get killed again and respawn again.  This would continue until the round end or until they went spec.  That doesn't happen anymore.  The nuke turns off after 3 seconds here.  But then this lead to players respawning on the station while all zombies were on shuttles, and they couldn't kill each other.  That being a problem as well, I went ahead and made the map prevent players from respawning.  So this problem is effectively 100% solved.\r\n\r\nThe other problem was that humans would all get killed the second a zombie spawned on a server with a fast zombie spawn time.  The map ups the zombie spawn time to between 20 and 30 seconds, giving players plenty of time to run.  But there was still a bottleneck where they would all get killed at the computer room.  So to get rid of that and split players up I added a third mini-shuttle which one can get to by taking an entirely new path out of spawn.  That way not everyone is in the same spot when a zombie appears.  There is also a good camping spot right before the third shuttle, so it's not too hard to hold zombies off.\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n- Area Portals for anti-lag.\r\n- Shuttles all move twice as fast as they did in the original ze_space_station release, so less time on them while moving = less lag.\r\n- Couple new secrets.\r\n\r\nThere aren't many other changes, but the addition of the new route was too big to release it under the old map name, so this one has its own map submission.  Also, the radar map here was improved over the previous one.  And that's all I've got here so feel free to ask questions or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE:</b>\r\nIf you don't know how to open a .7z file, just get the map as a .zip here:</font>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/cstrike/ze_space_stationzz.zip\">ze_space_stationzz</a>"

He designed some secrets and the area with the new shuttle pod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, map features...\r\n\r\n\r\n64 Spawns\r\n2 Escape Ships\r\nRadar Map\r\nCubemaps\r\n2 Easy Secrets\r\n2 Medium Secrets\r\n1 Insanely Difficult Secret\r\nPlace Named Nav File Included\r\nX-Wing\r\n\r\nChanges from beta5:\r\n\r\nBenefits for players in T Spawn:\r\n- Sentry guns removed\r\n- Door to one room was moved closer to T Spawn\r\n- Box stack that blocked terrorists from going left out of spawn removed\r\n\r\nAll that was to even out the field because earlier terrorists could count on being mowed down by zombies on the CT team since they would have to wait for the guns to be deactivated, and they had a longer way to walk than CT's.  This makes it a little more even.\r\n\r\nNew Shuttle:\r\nOnce you destroy the generator, if you hide around the generator room for a little bit a new door will unlock that leads to a second escape shuttle.  The door unlocks when the warning voice finishes saying \"Power Movement System Overload.\"\r\n\r\nArmoury:\r\nThis is an easy secret.  If you go to the old shuttle, when you get to the red bit at the end, there is an armoury at the right.  It starts locked, but if you shoot a fluorescent light on the wall near the window in the hall it unlocks the door.\r\n\r\nX-Wing:\r\nIf you complete the ridiculously impossible secret from hell you can fly the X-Wing around the map.  If you can't figure it out, well, there's always noclip.  :)\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n- The shuttles now have two more windows at the back, and all windows are now breakable.  That way you can go from one shuttle to the other.\r\n- New scenery windows near each shuttle.  They add to the environment a little.\r\n- New secret room in CT spawn.  It's easy to find.  A similar room existed in Beta 7 but this map is based off of Beta 5.\r\n- Red siren lights look different now.\r\n- Most walls are now reflective metal and look cooler as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or problems please ask!!  I will be more than happy to assist you.  Also, this map has a working .nav file so it could be used for Headcrab Hunter Mod, but the Headcrabs won't be able to enter the escape shuttles.   That's about it.   All that's left here is my crappy preview video of the X-Wing:</font> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<embed type=\"application/x-mplayer2\" src=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/cstrike/Station2.wmv\" name=\"MediaPlayer\" width=\"360\" height=\"280\" autoplay=\"0\" autostart=\"0\" />"

In the middle, they are 2 \"control panels\". when you press them, a lasser blocks every1 to enter by about 40 sec, then, they swap their status to off and then need some seconds to be online another time.\r\n\r\nBehind the space port, they are some tunnels. you can enter there by the 3th door at spawn. the tunnel's door will open when the scape pods are ready to fly.\r\n\r\nWhen the scape pods are ready you have 20 sec to enter and hold them (3 scape pods) . If any zombie take a scape pod, they will selfdestruct, so, good luck."
