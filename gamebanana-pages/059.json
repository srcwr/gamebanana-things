It was while designing the side exit that the curved minimlist structures took shape and i thought it looked great, so ran with the idea. By the time i got to the bridge section it had evolved into what it was, but this also presented a problem. Players could see eachother from either spawn, so i needed to block this off. Once players reached Deagle, Rifles and scoped Rifles, spawn kills would be a big disaster, so i placed the center structure to deal with that. Couple of glitches appeared on final compile, it would take me ages to remove, so i'll either move on or come back and fix if people like the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528.

This is infact my second design based on that map and this is the one i feel best portrays my work. The original map always brought a problem on the servers because the Spawns we're raised and there was no way to get back into them once you'd left. Spawn Campers had a pretty easy time picking people off at the back and other players could only attack directly in their line of sight. To combat this i've altered the height and added a staircase to the side. Using the custom dev textures as well the curving techniques i use, i'm proud of the outcome and hope others enjoy playing on it.\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528.
