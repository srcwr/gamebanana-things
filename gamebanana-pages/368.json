I also changed the back of the jail to a new way of getting to a secret area. -Made by Pwn3r1001 -Brought to you by Dooz Mapping Studio.\r\n\r\nRequired\r\n********\r\nCounter-strike:Source.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n************\r\nDownload the file, extract the breakfloor_jail_v2.bsp file to  steam/steamapps/{yourusername}/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps/\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n*********\r\nJust delete the map.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n*****\r\nYou can test the map by going to start a new server in CS:S then pick the map and start. \r\n\r\nAdmins\r\n******\r\nI would suggest using bzipper from here: http://www.fpsbanana.com/tools/1495 . Extract the .bsp into the folder and use the bzipper tool to compress. Then take that compressed file and put it into your map folder in your server( usually at C:\\Program Files\\Valve\\HLServer\\cstrike\\maps) or if your using a webserver for downloads it's the same idea. Also add breakfloor_jail_v2 to maplist.txt in your server folder so it shows up in the ingame maplist.\r\n\r\nMappers\r\n*******\r\nIf you would like to customize/modify breakfloor_jail_v2 email me at pwner1001@hotmail.com and I'll be glad to give you the .vmf as long as you give proper credit to my name in the readme and installer if you make one. \r\n \r\n\r\nThanks to\r\n*********\r\nzymex for original breakfloor map, and valve for all textures.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangeLOG\r\n******************************************************\r\nVersion 1.0 (First Version)\r\n-Released\r\n\r\n******************************************************\r\n"

		"_sText": "This is the same breakfloor all you breakfloorians like but modified by me. I added of course a jail hence the name breakfloor_jail. So when you fall down by some idiot teammate or by an enemy you won't die at the bottom, rather you teleport to jail. At each spawn point there is a surf sign on the walls. Shoot down the floor and the last glass block is where you can exit the enclosed breakfloor and surf down to the jail to open the jail door if a teammate is stuck in there. Even if you don't need to free a teammate there are blocks on the way with shotguns and smoke grenades on either side. On top of jail which is sort of hard to get to is where the snipers and semi-auto snipers are. In that same spot there are 3 teleport doors to get to either CT base T base or TOP. But since the floors might be broken when you teleport to the CT or T base you spawn on top of the light so you don't die.(water wouldn't work there) Also at the jail you can shoot and see through it from the outside but people inside it cannot. When you teleport back to the top middle wall I made it a bit wider only on the top part and put some weapons along with HEgrenades. There is also two ladders on both sides of the top middle divider because if you jump from there your health gets lowered, and like I said before water cannot work there. I also put a ladder at the top of the jail where the snipers are going down so that you don't die when you fall. I know it looks pretty pointless because people can just jump into the water at either side outside of the jail but it is an alternative. Another thing I added is another ramp by the jail that makes people surf into a wall that trigger teleports all the way to the top of the map. Yes I added a ceiling at the top, made of unbreakable glass that you can also shoot through from both sides. I placed a few weapons up there along with a couple flashgrenades. And to get down from there you just start walking towards the opening and it will boost you forward to get back to the ramps. \r\n"

I ended up spending a lot of time at buildingblockscs.com’s servers (now defunct), where Supa’s maps were featured and where he was the resident mapper.  This release was the latest version of my previous break-map attempts, taking the hex-block idea from Supa’s works.  The hex-block is the perfect shape and size to maximize the potential breakable area of a Source-based map.\r\n\r\nXero's description: \"This is the second version of Coestar's map 'CSS:Breakem' and it is a great change from his first one (Not saying that it was bad it was good) it is now based in a new arena: a warehouse that is completely destructable as well as other little 'Tit-Bits' you can now climb up vents to be a sneaky little bugger and snipe/own anybody that is unlucky enough to pass your way the werehouse has an underground area for god-knows what but it is a tunnel full of water and other things the design of this map is solid and it is great for big firefights great for a 'Break-Fest'\"\r\n\r\nThanks for posting my map and your good description, Xero!"
