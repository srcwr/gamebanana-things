The decaying bunker prison can still feel the effects of what is going on above, with earthshattering vibrations, slowly tearing away at the foundations.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe idea for this map is that it would bring back the old style of jailbreak, but incorporate some newer ideas. By this, I mean, the jailbreak days whereby maps were empty, and the Guards had to think of the games, without reliance on \"easy games and control areas\". The map is balanced for both sides, with oppurtunities to rebel in some areas, and far safer zones in others. This will hopefully allow players to re-live the olden days, when jailbreak was interesting, rather then just playing simon says round after round.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe modern twist I've added is a couple of interactive games for the prisoners to occupy themselves with. These include a football shootout area, based of the gameplay of ka_soccer. This includes automated settings to allow for better play. A total wipeout swimming pool, based on the TV series - whereby prisoners stand on risen poles in the pool, while dodging a spinning blade. The boxman game - whereby 1 prisoner is made into the \"Boxman\", and has to track down his teammates and kill them while blinded. The final game is a twist on mg_buses_from_hell, and all time minigame favourite. This consists of a room with the ability to lockdown, trapping prisoners in a enclosed area. Two drivable forklifts are then released, creating \"Drive-by Forklifts\".\r\n\r\n==================================================================================\r\n\r\nThis map has been tested with 20+ players and runs with high fps, reliable rounds, and a small size of just 24mb, a godsend in comparison to these new 50mb+ jailbreak maps.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe map also includes a minimap/radar, with full detail of rooms. Additionally, the map includes a vgui map image for the server list.\r\n\r\nFor an earlier release of the map, refer to: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/134650"

The layout is different, which makes it unique. Uniqueness is a good thing in my eyes. You'll notice that T's need to swim under CT spawn just to get to big cage. There a door opens which allows them to a hallway leading outside.\r\n\r\nI do hope you enjoy this map. Feedback is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-its soldier time"

		"_sText": "Ba Prism DTK\r\n============\r\n\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThis is a JB I whipped up out of boredom. I wanted to make a map while our development team was planning its new project, and I have been playing a lot more Jail break since the Mario map project, so I thought what the hell.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty simple map. It has a heap of space for wardens to get creative with games, but also hosts a lot of mini games for those lazy wardens.\r\n\r\nI will go through each part of the map the best I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nCell room/Gun room\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe first thing people notice about the cell room is the short ceiling. I designed it that way to give CTs a bit of a challenge from the get go.\r\n\r\nThere is a button in the middle to open cells, and an auto timer to do the same after 45 seconds of round start. There is an isolation room at the end of the room, and next to it is a roulet table. I originally had the table kill players automatically, but there were chances where both colours would die so I put it up to wardens discretion. \r\n\r\nMedic is the large cross (not solid) that rotates in the corner.\r\n\r\nThe gun room is equipped with selected weapons, which rotate/hover above futuristic shelves. The weapons will kill themselves after 0.5 seconds if no players pick them up, to save on resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outside\r\n===========\r\nOn the outside part of the map, it displays the position of the jail (space).\r\nThere are 4 mini games outside:<br>\r\nDiving Game<br>\r\nConnect 4<br>\r\nWipe Out<br>\r\nObstacle<br>\r\n\r\nThere is a large pool and 2 secrets gun outside (hint - for 1 gun, you need to press a combination of the letters on the banner).\r\n\r\nPretty simple and enjoyable games\r\n\r\nInside games\r\n============\r\nThe inside games have had a little more thought put into them.\r\n\r\nThey consist of:\r\n\r\nInterrogation\r\n-------------\r\nCTs move the Ts into the interrogation room and locks the door. 1 T at a time walks into the Square marked out by the hazard tape and is asked a question. \r\n\r\nThe Warden sets the answers using their True or False buttons on their side, and the Terrorist must guess the answer correctly, or they will be hit for 15 damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPacman\r\n------\r\nInspired by another jailbreak map (can't recall the name) I decided to make my own pacman game. 1 Terrorist moves into the Pacman door and the remainder move into the other side.\r\n\r\nPacman then has to kill the enemy terrorists as quickly as possible - ideal for getting to last request quickly. The game is stopped when the stop button is pressed and all terrorists are teleported to the corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunger Games\r\n------------\r\nThis one was inspired by a fellow DTK member. It is a take on the Hunger Games books/movies where Terrorists are teleported into a chamber with platforms (no weapons - not even knife).\r\n\r\nWhen the CT presses the start button, the doors above will begin to open and the players will be raised up on the platforms (any players silly enough not to get on a platform will be auto killed).\r\n\r\nWhen the doors close, the guns will spawn around the map and the 10 second timer will begin. Once the timer reaches 0, mp_friendlyfire is turned on and all Terrorists must scavange for guns and kill each other.\r\n\r\nThe game can be ended when the CT presses the stop button (teleports everyone out).\r\n\r\n\r\nDisco memory\r\n------------\r\nThis game is played on the dance floor of the disco. The CT enables the game (showing the colours of the dance floor) and selects a colour.\r\n\r\nThe terrorists have to remember where the colours of the floor tiles are, and then the floor is changed to black and white checkers and a colour is shown on the wall. Players must get to the colour before the dance floor changes  back (3 seconds).\r\n\r\nOnce the timer is up, the real dance floor is revealed again and all ts are locked into place until the CT stops the game or selects another colour. The CT can do what they like to the losers.\r\n\r\n\r\nShapes\r\n------\r\nThis is a simple game inspired by Nos Pro on his minecraft JB map.\r\n\r\nTerrorists are moved into a room and must jump through the walls as they move towards them. if they touch the hazard line they die.\r\n\r\nThere is a tricky wall that looks solid, but has 1 func_breakable square.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map also features basketball and Soccer, and has plenty of hidden guns and rebel options for Terrorists.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thats enough info. Download it and try it for yourself!\r\n\r\nCheers."
