It has more features, but that's largely because it's much bigger. At any rate, this map is very fun, too, and much more suited for smaller matches.\r\n\r\nThis map supports 40 players max.\r\n\r\nThe T and CT side each have 1 spawn on top of the UFO. This should add some fun!\r\n\r\n*** ALSO ***\r\n\r\n* VARIED SPAWNPOINTS !!\r\n\r\nEach team has 3 areas to spawn in on their side. It's now impossible to know exactly where your enemies will come from each round. 4 areas including the UFO spawn!\r\n\r\nIn the playtests with this new map I've had on my server, the map's been an absolute blast. VERY FAST playing map, too! No boring rounds on this map at all!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"
