The Terrorists can either assault the courthouse and plant the bomb, or rush through a motel and into an alleyway to blow of the attached prison complex. Counter-Terrorists start off in the courthouse, and must defend the area from the terrorists at the key bottlenecks. In the courthouse, there is a break room and lobby where the CTs can hold off their attackers, while a vent system can give the Terrorists a chance to flank around, it is easily defendible by one or two CTs. The other path is just as much as a bottleneck for the Ts, who must jump out of one or two windows on the second story motel. From here they can go through a sewer system, or try to attack the bomb site through a blind corner in an alleyway. Both bomb sites are quite hard to attack, and it takes team coordination and skill on both sides to win. This map is tricky, but I consider this good, because I don't like over-simplified maps one or two obvious routes. This map can support up to 64 people for the ultimate experience in mayhem.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: yellow; font-size: xx-Small\">Review by Milkman.</p>"

		"_sText": "### Cortona - Bomb/Defuse\r\n#### by Will2k\r\n\r\nde\\_cortona is a bomb/defuse map based on several old and historical towns in Tuscany, northern Italy. The inspiration was mainly drawn from the following cities: Cortona, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano, Montepulciano, Montalcino, Pistoia and Siena. This is not an accurate recreation as I took the creative freedom to merge several elements from real life counterparts into one old town in the map.\r\n\r\nThe map presents many authentic aspects from the above towns: The coat of arms of Tuscany on the town hall, the coat of arms of Cortona on the old castle, the church of Monteriggioni, the tower and gate of San Gimignano, the town hall of Cortona, the well of Montepulciano, the monastery of Pistoia and many others. Some landmarks were faithfully recreated in-game while others served as an inspiration to create something similar in the map.\r\n\r\nThe map is highly detailed and most of what you see is hand-made using brushwork; since this is potentially my last project for Counter-Strike Source, I decided to unleash my creativity on the brushwork to create the most complex of shapes without resorting much to custom models. It was somehow an exhausting task as it involved lots of precise clipping, vertex manipulation, texture scaling and rotation and so on. Almost all of the arches and buildings decorations are made of brushes while a smaller fraction is made of displacements. The brushwork load reached 91%. \r\n\r\nThe layout is the classic figure of 8, made popular by dust/dust2. It's easy to remember and navigate through while offering plenty of tactical options for both sides.\r\n\r\nThe optimization process was a little less demanding than my last map [cs\\_east\\_borough](http://gamebanana.com/css/maps/164363 \"\") and took me around 4 days to finalize and to find the optimum locations for hints and areaportals and the optimum fade distances for models. The high FPS is consistent around the map and provides smooth gameplay for players. (Stable 300fps on my system at every location in the map while walking alone without bots/players).\r\n\r\nAdditional optimization was done to the gameplay flow by heavily implementing clip brushes to ensure a smooth and fluid gameplay/motion for players. The last kind of optimization was for lighting through modification of lightmaps and smoothing groups. This step was necessary since the map has lots of arched brushes and many of them managed to confuse Vrad which made my manual intervention a must to avoid poor lighting optimization.\r\n\r\nThe map has:\r\n\r\n- 64 spawn points (32 vs 32)\r\n- radar overview\r\n- 3D skybox (actual Tuscan landscape)\r\n- Soundscapes\r\n- custom textures \r\n- 3 custom models (2 trees, 1 shrub freely available from STALKER game, courtesy of the now defunct GSC Gameworld)\r\n- Manually-tuned Nav file with place names\r\n\r\nAll the custom resources (except the nav) are embedded in the bsp.\r\n\r\nFor installation, simply extract the 4 files in the zip archive (bsp, nav and 2 txt files) to your \\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps folder.\r\n\r\nThis project had a lifespan of 4 months: I started it in May 2012, stopped in June, resumed in July,  picked up the pace in August and went into overdrive in September. As I mentioned earlier, this is potentially my last level for CSS as I shall be moving to CSGO (a map is already underway for Global Offensive).\r\n\r\nI really hope you enjoy this map as much as I did creating and testing it.\r\n\r\nComments and constructive feedback are always welcome.\r\n\r\nWill2k\r\n\r\nOctober 1, 2012"

The terorist need to plant the bomb successfully and the Counter terrorist need to prevent them from planting it or defuse it if already planted\r\n\r\nThis is my first map ever, I never mapped before. I started three weeks ago. Now everything is advancing well and was able to start optimising part of my map. I had like 27 FPS in one part of the map and raised it to 110 using areaprotal to seal those room. Still this map is not yet intended for a wide public release. More aiming at releasing it to get feed back to improve it.\r\n\r\nThis map does not yet work with CS bots because of door they can't seem to open. So not a good idea to put in rotation that use bots.\r\n\r\nMost of the map is over 60 FPS now but this is with P4 3.0Ghz in LAN. But I tested it on our server and ping were similar. Still many thing to add in and around the street. This will be probably my last CS map. Next one will be DOD Source, the game I play everyday.\r\n\r\nExpect a final build around end of March 2005.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment on the map and submit idea via e-mail: coolhandluke@907th.com\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this map.\r\n\r\n[907th] CoolHandLuke"

Sorry i'm late for about 15 years=), but i think not to share this map would be a crime.&nbsp;<br>So, let me introduce my new map - de_convent.&nbsp; A frivolous idea, to hastily make a map for playing with my buds on LAN, became a serious work for an entire year! A comment, I came across on the de_island_v2 map page, which reads: \"..one of the rare CSS maps that looks as good as it plays!\", became a motto for a time of bulding my map. And since I am a very stubborn guy, the work was fully completed. Initially, the map was supposed to be smaller (8x8) and simplier, but over time it became clear that it was not enough to implement all the ideas, and it had to be expanded to 32x32. The two planned buildings turned into a fortified island, with a&nbsp; medieval monastery, ruined by tsunami, and its huge dungeon.<br>It may seem that some locations suffer from gigantism, but, as a rule, this is a necessary measure, because I didn’t want to constrain the player (tightness is the problem of many CSS maps), and a room for tactics now more than enough. And, as the area grew, so did the need for decorations, the modeling and drawing of which took most of the time. As a result, despite all the vagaries of the early Source Engine, the map came out pretty solid, the gameplay here is extremely variable and interesting, even with bots, that use the entire area to the fullest. In addition, I spent a long time for layout, so the map is well balanced and optimized as much as possible. What can I say, it is better to download and familiarize yourself.
