It's purpose is to reduce filesize and provide more normal \"classic\" gameplay. The things that affect gameplay and are not found in normal maps are removed (the built-in speed &amp; gravity mods etc). This is for all the CSS junkies who get very angry when they can't buy their own gun, can't run up a ladder or can't fall 4 meters without getting hurt. So if you want to play this unique map but with normal gameplay, this lite version is for you.\r\nI have worked very hard on this for more than a year. Much time and research has gone into making the ship and its layout as realistic as possible - gameplay balance was less important. Most time and work has gone into getting this huge map to compile without critical errors! Please provide constructive criticism and bug reports to help me improve later versions.\r\n(If you really want a version with only 1 Terrorist spawn area, just ask and I will make one for you)\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nmap, custom textures, most custom sounds &amp; all sound editing by Olivier Doorenbos\r\nwww.CGTextures.com - source of most raw custom textures\r\ndasboot music by Klaus Doldinger\r\nship horn sound from www.youtube.com/BIGMIKESOCAL\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES:\r\nYou can do whatever you want (distribute, edit the VMF file, release modified version etc) as long as you give me credit where it is due and do not profit financially.

The main layout is the same but some areas have been changed completely. The textures are all new and most of them are custom. \r\n\r\nThe map is set in a roadhouse out in a desert close to nowhere. After an initial firefight the Counter Terrorists have fortified in the roadhouse. The terrorists have regrouped in the mountains and plan a second attack to cause havoc and destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no drivable car in this version of the map as there is in the old map. Because of this changes have been made to the tunnel to help the T approach to the fuel station. Displacement maps have been used to create a more realistic environment. The Doors Roadhouse Blues is still playing in the restaurant area.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the people at <a href=\"http://www.deadmen.co.uk\"><b class=orange>Dead Men Walking</b></a> for testing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't forget to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/53929\"><b class=orange>de_astute_dMw</b></a> and <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/54083\"><b class=orange>deagle_crypt_dMw_b3</b></a>."

The map is based around two main buildings the larger of which links all levels of the map from three storeys above ground to two storeys below ground. Bomb site A is located underground whilst site B can be found on a balcony leading from the top floor office. I have tried to ensure balance and sufficient time to get from one site to another meaning there is always a final face off while the timer is ticking. I have spent a lot of  time tweaking bot navigation to ensure they use the map as intended. There are 12 spawns per side. All areas are named and contain ambient sounds. Please remember this is my first map so be honest to not too harsh with your comments, all feedback will be gratefully received. Hope you enjoy. Rick_0_Shay."
