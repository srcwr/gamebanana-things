And finally there is another group of floodlights in the sewer that can be turned on with a switch as well.  I put a delay on how long before they can be toggled because i worried about some jackass flicking it on and off over and over, pissing everyone off. \r\n\r\nApart from that its straight forward. 2 entrances to the camp, the main gate and the sewer, and 2 entrances to the sewer (from within the camp and in a bunker outside.)\r\n\r\na train will bring the players to the camp, although they can jump off whenever if they like.  havent tried it on a zombie server, so im hoping that everything fits together nicely.  there are plenty of hiding and hold-out spots so it should work just fine.\r\n\r\nI didnt make the guard towers, but i cant remember the creator's name. and the buildings in the camp are from Half life 2.\r\n\r\nanyways thats about it, give it a try and please let me know what you think!"

Basically you're on a small cruiser, Star Ship Nehellenia.  However, the T-Virus got into the air supply, triggering the alarms.  You can try to escape to the smaller ship off the port bow, or you can see if you can hold off the zombies by barricading one of the many rooms on the main ship.  There is also a smaller shuttle in the shuttle bay.  It's a modified version of the third escape ship from ze_space_station_zz and zm_salon_moon that is slightly smaller, but set so that it can be piloted.  The view is not that great though so I gave it a display screen that shows what is in front of the ship, so between that and the radar map you can navigate easily.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIf you have a server which gets rid of point_servercommand entities, you must make a custom config for this map with the following command:\r\n\r\nsv_turbophysics 0\r\n\r\nThis is so that no one will glitch out of the drivable shuttle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom Models:\r\nThis map has many custom models in it.  I got them from rp_evocity, but I don't know where they came from before that.  Please don't disapprove me right off the bat for not crediting their original author, just PM me if you know who made them and I will get them listed on the authors section.  rp_evocity does have some props from The Ship, but I made sure not to use those ones, so it's not illegal in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, post them here or PM me.  I am on FPSB almost every day.  Thanks for playing!!</font>"

There have been many changes, and I will now go over all of them for you...\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst off, the fps on this map has been dramatically increased from what it was on _v2a.  By using area portals and hint brushes I was able to raise the FPS quite a bit for the outside of the ship.  This was probably the biggest thing I did to the map, and took the most time of all of the changes, giving me a solid foundation for everything else I did with the map.\r\n\r\nNow for the interesting stuff...\r\n\r\nThe German FlaK .88:\r\nThis was originally a prefab made by uberkirsche (now banned from fpsb) and could be found in the original version of zm_runforyourlife by Markokka.  However, for my map, I have edited it substantially.  It now fires a double-shell for both physics and actual damage (so it can knock the boats around when it hits them) and it has been edited to remove a crash bug.  The map will NOT crash your server even though it has this cannon in it.  The FlaK will kill a human outright in 1 hit, even if it misses by 10 feet or so.  7-8 hits are required to kill a zombie, depending on how much health they are given and the accuracy of the gunner.  Occasionally it will get stuck for one round, but during beta testing this only happened twice.  This bug doesn't affect the rest of the map.\r\n\r\nThe Island:\r\nIt has been completely redone.  It is now a fortress instead of a radio tower.  There are two doors to the stairs to the FlaK on top.  The doors can be closed from the stairwell.  Once closed, you can't open them from outside, but I have put a secret passage that will take you from the basement of the island to the inside of the stairwell.  It's a difficult secret though.  The basement is almost exactly like it was in previous versions.\r\n\r\nThe New Ship:\r\nThis is a small Polish barge.  It has one secret on board, and has a few camping spots.  Watch out for FlaK fire though if you're near a window.\r\n\r\nGlass Platform Secret:\r\nThis has been modified.  Try to re-learn it.  :)  It still gives 999 kills.\r\n\r\nBoats:\r\nThis map has the two boats from _v2a as well as the mini boat from the original zm_natalyas_ship, except it actually works here.\r\n\r\nOther Changes:\r\nI have changed some areas of the big ship...  Some like the command tower and bridge were changed to improve FPS, while other spots were edited elsewhere.  Notably, the area with the truck has been re-done with two more spots, and the rafter over the spawn in the aft section of the ship has been given a block of invisible texture so that zombies can't kill the humans on it just by jumping up and stabbing.  I also modified the skybox some, and changed the lighting of the map.  It's now a lot brighter, but it isn't quite day.  It just makes it look more picturesque.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>A Note to Server Administrators:</b>\r\nThis map has a point_servercommand inside it.  Without it the boats will not work and the cannon won't function properly.  If you have a point_servercommand override plugin, then you'll need to make a .cfg for this map with sv_turbophysics 0 in order for the boats and cannon to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Thanks go to:</b>\r\nZombie Network III and Vs3 Zombie Mod servers for running beta tests of this map, and to Vampy and MoOnLiGht for running the betas for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>If you would like to assess this map, download it first and play it.  I don't want meaningless assessments from people who just looked at the screenshots.</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nAllright, that's about it.  Please post any questions or comments you may have.</font>"

Please go download it instead:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/54958\">zm_natalyas_ship_v3</a></font>\r\n\r\nThis is the second version.  I made this version because there were a number of minor problems with the first version, and, most importantly, the boat did not work properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn This Version:\r\n48 Spawns (4 Areas)\r\nCubemaps\r\nRadar Map\r\nHDR Lighting\r\n2 Drivable Boats\r\nVideo of the Map\r\nModified Secret\r\nNew Camping Spots\r\nsv_turbophysics 0\r\nNew Crate Skins\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the two 100% functional drivable boats I had to have a point_servercommand set sv_turbophysics to 0.  This causes a number of problems involving barricades...  Zombies can no longer pull on objects, but can walk into them and push them that way.  This is not conducive to barricade play.  As such, I updated the map with some more climbing camping spots and modified a few existing ones for firewalls.  The map is now a more difficult map overall, but it will also be a lot more fun.  :)\r\n\r\nLike the older version, this map has custom Cargo Container and Vending Machine skins built in.  They only appear on this map and won't over-write any skins you already have.  This one has two different cargo container skins from the last one...  A 1337 UP container in place of the DHL, and another Umbrella container.  There is also a flag skin (The Latvian Flag) and a plasma tv skin.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n-Nav isn't paked with the map.  If you want it, get the nav separately <a href=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/cstrike/zm_natalyas_ship_v2a.nav\">here</a>.\r\n-The only bug I've seen so far is that a desk doesn't appear in the command portion of the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems don't hesitate to let me know.  As far as I can tell there are no texture packing errors like there were with the previous version, but occasionally someone will say they don't have them so speak up if you don't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave Fun!!\r\n\r\n*EDIT*\r\nI have added a gameplay video...  Shows you how the boats might work on a reload server with !propmenu.  There were only 4 or 5 of us playing though...  I haven't played on a full server so we've yet to see what that will be like.</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<object id=\"MediaPlayer\" width=720 height=480 classid=\"CLSID:22D6f312-B0F6-11D0-94AB-0080C74C7E95\" standby=\"Eating Chicken...\" type=\"application/x-oleobject\" codebase=\"http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/mplayer/en/nsmp2inf.cab#Version=6,4,7,1112\">\r\n<param name=\"filename\" value=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/cstrike/zm_natalyas_ship_v2a.wmv\">\r\n<param name=\"Showcontrols\" value=\"False\">\r\n<param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"False\">\r\n<embed type=\"application/x-mplayer2\" src=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/cstrike/zm_natalyas_ship_v2a.wmv\" name=\"MediaPlayer\" width=720 height=480></embed>\r\n</object>"

(Actually, you'll find that the hull for roy's ship is actually a modified and carved out version of the oil tanker in de_port.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, here are some specific features:\r\n\r\n48 Player Slots\r\nRadar Map\r\nDrivable Mini-Boat\r\nCubemaps\r\n1 Easy-To-Find Secret\r\n1 Very Hard Secret\r\nElectrocution Trap Room\r\n\r\nThat obviously doesn't sum up the map, but whatever.  The map is more of a climbing map, but there are a bunch of barricade spots as well.\r\n\r\nThe drivable boat is a little mini boat.  Press \"use\" on the little red button to activate it, then press \"use\" on the steering wheel to control the boat.  Just use your forwards//backwards and strafe left//strafe right keys to pilot the ship.  Once you reach your destination, or fall out (It's not perfect) just press jump a few times to disengage the controls.  Then press the red button again to turn off the ship and freeze it in place.\r\n\r\nThe map has custom textures paked into it for the cargo containers, bookshelves, vending machines, and water bottles.  Any other skins you might see in my screen shots are not included.\r\n\r\nThere is one known area in the main storeroom of the ship where a texture is missing...  That might get fixed in a future release, but I don't know when I'll put the map out there again.  If you have any other texture problems aside from the door frame, let me know and provide screen shots if possible.  I had trouble with pakrat but I think I've fixed everything.\r\n\r\nThe Radar tends to repeat itself, but that's just got to do with the size of the map.  It still will show with accuracy the player's position on the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's it for now.  I hope you enjoy the map.  ^_^\r\n- Natalya[AF] -\r\n\r\nAnd thanks go to Seraphim for her translating efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*EDIT*</b>\r\n\r\nOkay, I have released a zip of all the custom textures used for this map, along with a few other miscellaneous files that should also be paked into the map.  You only need this if you have texture missing errors everywhere.  It also might get rid of that door frame error too so if that's really bugging you, download <a href=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/cstrike/zm_natalyas_ship%20pack.zip\">This</a>.</font>"

		"_sText": "An open zombie map with a bunch of small huts which you can hide in, theres also a pyramid which is useful if you want to put your back to a closed space and watch the door with your team mates to keep out those pesky zombie critters! zombies may have it tough in this map if the humans gang up on them from the hiding spots, but if anybody leaves the safety of a hut, pyramid or tower, they'll be easy targets, the key to this map is using teamwork to keep bombarding the enemy faction. It is a night tim map as well to make it even CREEPIER!!! just kidding, i just wanted to play around with the skybox and the light levels. This is the second zm_ map i have uploaded, and the first is MUCH better if you'd care to check it out =)\r\n\r\nplease leave comments with suggestions as i am planning on working on this map more through the ages to make it better.\r\n\r\nalso, if youd like to request a map, you can add me on steam or shoot me a mail"
