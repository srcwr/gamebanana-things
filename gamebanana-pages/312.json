I was really bored around 1 o'clock in the morning a few weeks back, and I decided to give myself a set amount of time to make a map. For some odd reason, I decided three hours should be a half decent amount of time to create something well, half decent. I decided to split it into 1 hour for build/textures, optimization, and design.\r\n\r\nThe map itself is pretty straight forward. It is a bit of a get a gun and kill people surf, and it is actually a lot of fun. Yes, for all of you who complain, there is a jail, although there really isn't much of a point to it, but it compliments the map quite nicely.\r\n\r\n**********************************************\r\n\r\nFinal Changes/Additions/Fixes:\r\n-No more spawn jumping/killing\r\n-The first ramp turn around to Awp's is no longer possible\r\n-Re-texture\r\n-Additional entrances to jail/decreased camping\r\n-A friend on UAkron suggested knives only in Jail. Now all weapons are stripped on entry to jail and you are left with a knife. (Makes it easier for the people on top of jail.)\r\n- Took the doors off of the frames. (Another suggestion from UAkron) Now you can just walk through the portals to your destination\r\n-Took out pieces of the awfully cluttered spiral ramps. It's now a bit more difficult to surf.\r\n-Every player is equipped with a P228 and full Kevlar and helmet at the beginning of every round.\r\n- Optimization changes\r\n-Increased some of the sizes of the water pools\r\n\r\n(There have been a lot of changes to this map to make it the best it could be with the design that I originally used. Many will agree with me when I say that the original design could have been more thought out, so I see no point in working on this any further. These changes should increase the popularity of the map, and the enjoyment of the surf.)\r\n\r\nAll questions/complaints/comments/advice/opinions:\r\n\r\nXfire: Wowyourgaiy\r\nEmail: Phantomoper3@comcast.net"

The map has a general theme, you travel through time attempting to assassinate an evil emperor. Pretty generic as far as stories go but hey, I tried. Stages each have tangible themes: stage 1 is ancient egypt, stage 2 is medieval times, stage 3 is the 1800's, stage 4 is the emperor's palace, and stage 5 is the time machine.\r\n\r\nDon't be surprised if you get frustrated, it's a tough map.

It has no jail, but that's because I don't really care enough to make one.\r\n\r\nRelease Thread: http://forums.solidsurf.info/index.php/topic,3455.0.html\r\n\r\nDevelopment Thread:\r\nhttp://forums.solidsurf.info/index.php/topic,3241.0.html\r\n\r\nintox.

I begin my return with this map: surf_the_gloaming (pronounced \"the glow-ming\").\r\n\r\nThis map all begins with FAJ (what good maps isn't he a part of?). He told me to get off my lazy ass and make an \"EPIC\" surf map. After much enticing, I finally got around to doing it. This is the result. I am not so sure how epic this map is; I leave that to you to decide. I incorporated all aspects of mapping in which I am proficient: skyboxes, ramps, neat geometry, flow, learning curves, texturing, and logic systems. This map has taught me much.\r\n\r\nIt's just a linear surf map. Nothing more, nothing less (well, maybe a little bit more). There are a few secrets, some of which I particularly enjoy (Scout Battles!)\r\n\r\nI have MANY people I need to thank for helping me test this map (in no particular order):\r\n\r\nTeeth\r\nshini\r\nintox.Juicy J\r\nintox.japetheape\r\nintox.cLutch\r\nintox.Scarface\r\nintox.waffleburger\r\nintox.Mani\r\n(any other intox members I may have left out)\r\nknife\r\nJesuswashomeless\r\nRyan S\r\nSintaxError\r\nEmmitt Nervend"

The small tear will still be available with access to a knife for players who would like to have weapons while they surf. There will be a single knife at the egg (end of map) to be able to destroy the breakable walls. Failing on any level will bring you back to the beginning of that particular level, the only exception is level 2, floor 1.\r\n\r\nsurf_teenpregnancy_v1 update:\r\nFixed global jail teleport issues.\r\n\r\nSurf_teenpregnancy, for all the kids who slept through 8th grade health class.\r\n\r\nWhy take a life when you can create one? This anatomically semi-correct representation of our favorite subject is now brought to new light in the form of a killer surf map. Three levels, three secrets, and one extremely creative jail makes for an intense, if not freakin' hilarious experience!\r\n\r\nTips: 1. Certain parts of the map are difficult, keep practicing. This is especially true in the beginning. The opening is small but very doable. 2. The \"dome\" has glass doors that break 3. The doctor's utensil's control system is inverted. Use the back key to move the object forward, and the forward key to move the object backwards. 4. The secret room is on the end of the second level to the left, where there seems to be a shadow platform. Bunnyhop it to the corner. Remember to use that well-earned grenade wisely.\r\n\r\nMap by: Butterknife (aka Jaekto)\r\nJail layout idea based on ny_superhappiest\r\nSpecial thanks to all the testers and brainstormers at intoxgaming \r\n\r\n\r\n "
