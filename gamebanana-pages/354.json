		"_sText": "This map is a series of maps that i have started a few years back. Worked on Tron 3 for 3 weeks during the christmas holidays in order to release this for the Jediforces ( http://www.jediforces.net ) Mega Fun night. People really liked this version compared to some older ones and decided to release this map to the public. Since valve has added a cap to the map file sizes, i had to chop the map in 2 parts. You will find Part A and B . In each, you will have 6 mini maps ( Races , Deagles , Shotguns , Cannons , and many more ) . \r\n\r\nThanks again To all that have helped, and Thats a lot to McFluffy for some help on some mario props. Everything is custom in the map. Some map designs we have already seen in the past of course, but everything was made from scratch. I hope the CS community will enjoy this release. And thanks to all the beta testers. \r\n\r\nIf you do find any glitchess, since this seems to be an early release, please submit them on our forums and i will gladly arrange the bugs. \r\n\r\nThere are 64 spawns, thought the map still needs optimizing ... if you do have a low pc ... i would not suggest playing this with more than 32 players. I play it on our 47 man pub, and i do not lag... but i do have a monster for a machine :D . \r\n\r\nHow to play the map :\r\n\r\nThe Ts Will pick a map. They simply have to walk up to a picture for it to break, and then Enter the picture. \r\n\r\nIn the first part ( A ) Most maps have dispensers giving you weapons when you enter the selected map.\r\nIn part B you will have buyzones\r\n\r\nOne of the maps Resembles SpeedCastle, Thanks to the original Author ( Knas ). Remade a new design from its base. \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to all that supported tron for so long. \r\n\r\nEric_Jedi\r\nhttp://www.jediforces.net"

		"_sText": "I made this game based off a game I played recently by armor games, the game can be found here:\r\nhttp://armorgames.com/play/2625/storm-the-house-3\r\n\r\nJust like in the game, storm the house 3, this map has one house and people comming at it. It also has a wall to defend the house with. Although that is about the only similarity between it and the game itself. With this map I changed a few things to help it work out properly for the CT team, being that they're the team that has to rush in to try and kill the T's in the house. I added some destroyed tanks on the field, and since there are tanks in the game \"storm the house 3\", I felt it to be appropriate for the setting. Also, in addition to the tanks, I made the map into more of a trench type of area instead of something like a flat land area seen in the game.\r\n\r\nThe map itself is very foggy, to make it a little more suspenseful on when the CTs are actually going to come up to the house. if you play your cards right, you might actually be able to get to the wall without being seen and be able to safely destroy it without getting shot at all.\r\n\r\nThe wall itself has a health of 500, but until you destroy the wall, you can't get to the base where the Terrorists are held in. But behind the wall are 4 teleporters, each one will send u to a different spot inside of the house. This way the counter terrorists can get back at the terrorists for killing them on their run upto the wall.\r\n\r\nThe counter terrorists start out on the far side of the trench, completely away from the house and not visible at all to the terrorists due to the fog. When the CTs spawn, they will each get an m4. There is an m4 in each spawn point so there will more than likely be more laying around if you are needing more ammo and want to go back to get a new gun. Once the CTs spawn, they will be allowed to immediately rush forward toward the house using the lamp posts and tanks as structure to hide behind. Once you are able to get to the wall, your objective is to destroy the wall, get a new gun and grenades, and jump through the teleporter. This will bring you straight into the Terrorist spawn and will allow you to win the game.\r\nOverall, there are 48 counter terrorist spawn points.\r\n\r\nThe terrorists will start out in the house, spawned on the back wall of the house. On the inside walls of the house there are 6 scouts, but the terrorists are also given a buy zone, giving them a great advantage over the counter terrorists. But here's the twist, you, as a terrorist, only have 8 spawn points in the home. You might have as many guns as you want, but you lack number. You have a short amount of time to eliminate all of the counter terrorists before the reach and destroy your wall. If they get into your base, you might as well kiss your ass goodbye. But if you are able to kill them all before they reach your base, or even if they reach your base and you somehow end up killing them all, you will probably be called a hacker, but you will have won the round. \r\n\r\nGood luck, have fun, and enjoy my map!"
