I got the idea to make a fun CT vs. T rush/camping minigame map from smee tower so I decided to make a map that would have gameplay similar to that, but more fun, more camping spots, more excitement, and more alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe map consists of many spots:\r\n\r\n-outside area where t's spawn\r\n-a basement under the 1st floor of the bar\r\n-1st floor of the bar\r\n-2nd floor of the bar\r\n-a roof above the 2nd floor of the bar\r\n\r\n*There are tunnels that can go from the outside area to the 1st floor or to the basement. Also, there are 3 ladders that can go from the outside area to the roof.\r\n\r\nAs the game starts, T's make their way to the front of the bar (or go the basement route/roof route) then break down the doors and try to kill all the CT's protecting the bar. (CT's spawn in the bar). CT's have numerous places to camp, including knocking over tables and hiding behind them, hiding behind the bar counter, etc. The game is over when all T's are dead or all CT's are dead, or the bomb blows up when planted.\r\n\r\n*There is a bomb site on the large table on the second floor.\r\n\r\n********On the roof facing the T spawn, there is an invisible wall so CT's cannot shoot the T's as they approach the bar.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHave fun and please leave feedback!\r\n"

Check the shading out for yourselves, I personally think they look great.\r\n\r\n### Start Room\r\n- 64 Spawns, 32 for each team\r\n- 8 different spawn obstacles to race for the selection\r\n- Auto-selects a map if one hasn't been chosen 45 seconds after the teleporter to the selection area has been triggered.\r\n- 14 different map selections\r\n\r\n#### Map Size Info:\r\nDownload: 60.7 MB\r\nFull Map Size: 138 MB\r\n\r\nIf it's too big for you, don't play it. Both SWAG and Creative multigames are larger maps. \r\n\r\n###### Dev Log\r\n\r\n- Added a wall in breakbox to prevent players jumping to their death instantly\r\n- [Hopefully] fixed fall damage filter only working on some players--not yet tested\r\n- Fixed blinddeagle spawning bug\r\n- Floor in breakbox disappears after 30 seconds to deter campers\r\n- Added a small console message tutorial on disabling music\r\n- Added my name to the map in a console message\r\n- Made Speedjumps a certain win--you don't have to go back through the level to kill enemies.\r\n- Fixed a double-song bug on finishing Sliderace\r\n- Fixed knife only giving a knife to the person that pressed the button--not tested yet.\r\n- Fixed USP not giving weapons to CTs\r\n- Added two new spawn events\r\n- Trains Floor now scrolls.\r\n- Fixed hiding/camping spots in trains.\r\n- Added a few more boards in trains.\r\n- Speedjumps end sounds don't play every time you drop and pick up the gun anymore.\r\n- New start teleport sound effects.\r\n- Deleted a few start teleport sound effects that didn't work.\r\n- Changed the sound played on selection buttons being pressed.\r\n- Added Random.\r\n- Added Awp [Small].\r\n- Added Popcorn Remix by EON.\r\n- Removed some of the end challenge audios. There are only four challenge maps anyway, and I had like 20 finish audios...\r\n- Pressing the \"Arena\" part of the Arena selection picks a random of the weapons for the arena.\r\n- Cannons in Cannon surf are disabled after five minutes.\r\n- Changed the order of the Slide easy-makers, hopefully it will help noobs a bit.\r\n- Added some lights to shotguns. It doesn't look too good, but it won't be as dark.\r\n- Added a spray wall in the spawn room. It appears after someone wins the selection.\r\n- The person who wins the selection gets sped up [I think it's 1.5x speed?] until the map is selected.\r\n- Added an Arcanine decal in the spawn room.\r\n- Players finishing challenges now get invisibility, as well as invisible weapons. If you switch to knife, however, your weapon is visible on your back. I don't think there's a fix for this :/\r\n- Players finishing Sliderace and Bunnyhop now get knives.\r\n- Added Arcanine decal in the start room.\r\n- Added Wake Me Up [Instrumental] By Avicii.\r\n- Players that did not finish the challenge maps get slowed down. [Half speed] This also adds a one-second delay for finishers on Bhop.\r\n- There are now chat notifications for the \"easymakers\" in sliderace activations.\r\n- Since making the finishing weapons invisible in sliderace makes all the M249s invisible, I added some neat glow effects on them so that you can find them. [Other than the one the winner gets]\r\n- Added a backing to Speedjumps, with a few smoke grenades with sprites attatched to them. This adds several glass pieces in Speedjumps.\r\n- Added an output to set the server timelimit to 40 minutes.\r\n- Random now works 100% of the time\r\n- Changed Iceskate--no more invisible ceiling, now has surf ramps and a leet where you can get a scout which turns off the iceskate.\r\n- Gold checkered spawn no longer kills you if you fall.\r\n- Lowered Trains cars' height a bit to make it easier to get back onto them.\r\n- Spray Wall now scrolls\r\n- Raised the Godlike roof on BoosterKnife\r\n- Fixed trains camp-stopper hurting players between the first and second cars.\r\n- Changed AWP selections to Snipers. You now get to chose between a scout and an awp for these selections.\r\n- Added Backstab versions of Knife and Booster-knife\r\n- Added a second version of shotguns\r\n- Added a second version of breakbox. This also creates an interesting random game easter egg type thing.\r\n- Added a headshot button for Arena\r\n- Iceskate boosters now work and are slightly more powerful.\r\n- Added Iceskate [Backstab]\r\n- Changed the skybox to Icebergs by Komaokc\r\n- Fixed Breakbox bug\r\n- Fixed being able to see glass in speedjumps from shotguns bug\r\n- Added another start room event\r\n- Added a shotguns option for Cannon surf\r\n- Changed some of the spawn room event textures so they're easier on the eyes\r\n- Added another start room event\r\n- Added sayings in the start room with lighting effects\r\n- Added special thanks in the start room\r\n- Added music credits in the start room\r\n- Slightly increased the size of the sayings, and improved the lighting effects\r\n- Added something to stop corner campers in knife backstab \r\n- Updated the music credits image\r\n- Updated the special thanks image\r\n- Fixed off texture on a platform in speedclimb\r\n- Added a final thanks image\r\n- Added speed by Avicii\r\n- Added something to stop Sliderace being spammed. You can now only pick it once before having to choose random to get it. Speedclimb, Speedjumps, and Bunnyhop do NOT have this\r\n- Updated Name wall\r\n- Updated Special Thanks\r\n- Updated iceskate so that you can't corner camp\r\n- Speedclimb, Speedjumps, and Bunnyhop now have repeat-stoppers. Choosing random is now the only way to get them after the first time.\r\n- Really fixed the error messages showing up when there were no errors\r\n- Music in-map now registers as music in game and can be changed using options > music volume\r\n- Deleted the mass of guns in start of breakbox in favor of game_player_equips+server lag\r\n- Fixed broken repeat stoppers on Bunnyhop and Speedclimb\r\n- Fixed broken grenade spawners in Cannon surf and Boosterknife [May have been causing a server crash problem]\r\n- Aimed the initial boosters on Booster Knife slightly downwards to avoid cluster knifing at the start\r\n- Fixed random getting breakbox bug where knives were not spawned\r\n- Added a grenade in the middle of breakbox that appears when it's picked randomly\r\n- Fixed another random breakbox knife bug\r\n- Changed the positions of the sayings\r\n- Changed the position of the name wall, special thanks, last thanks, and music credits to rotating, non-solid blocks.\r\n- Changed the way the teleporters activate in an attempt to make it so the server doesn't crash when a ton of weapons are spawned at the same time."

		"_sText": "A mini game map where you spawn in a fish tank and the water rises and you either have to finish off the enemy fast or eventually you will need to go up to the top for air where everyone is battling for a tiny room where they can breath. Built it in a day took a bit of time, its set up for 16v16 so larger mini game servers can run it to. There is a working water mine in the middle you can shoot it to make it blow up or you can shoot at the chain to make it rise up (sometimes into the room) then blow up any campers up there :) either way its fun to mess with. Prefab credit to Killo$ity for part of the chain used. Please comment and rate the map, so I know if I should release more of these abnormal maps in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks to Borixon for a custom texture and help."
