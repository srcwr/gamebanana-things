I have spent about four days on the map so may need some touching up but it should be pretty well ready to go. The map was completely remade from scratch so there will be differences in heights, wall thickness (Prevent feet from showing through) and much more. I have tested it inside and out seems to be working pretty smooth. There are no buy zones, hostage rescue or bomb sites. I kept those all off as it is more of a DM map. Also there are quite a few screenshots but I wanted to allow you to view before downloading.<br><br>Map Objective<br><br>The sole purpose of this map was to make it so the map is not one sided. If you have great players on a single team they will eventually destroy the opponents to the point you can't even leave spawn. I also wanted to make a few differences to allow some what of a change to the map. Adding in a few extra spots and changing already existing areas. Also of course I wanted to make it FUN!<br><br>I am open to critique and ideas. So if you play it and think something may be better please do not hesitate to ask and or point it out! All in all I hope to see this map on the cs_crackhouse server in the future and I hope all the players enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it! I also do not know the original author of cs_crackhouse but shout out to them as I my map is based on it.<br><br>Below are servers that are running the map. HG is playing on a slightly different one that is missing the windows and all breakable walls. Other than that it's the same.<br><br>F5 Site: http://factor5gaming.com<br>24/7 Crackhouse DM: 104.207.138.195:27095<br><br>Hellsgamers Site: http://hellsgamers.com<br>Deathmatch Rotation Server:&nbsp;67.228.181.64:27015<br><br>Enjoy,<br><br>OneShot23<br><br><br><br>"

It is symetrical for t's and ct's so there is no real advantage for either... at the center of the course is the mausoleum, there are two doors, one for each team, hit \"use\" to open the door. A flashlight is recommended for inside the laberynth style mausoleum, as it is entirely dark, adding to the experience of the course. A flashlight is not required for the outdoors however. The outdoors consists of the two starting graveyards, and the two paths around the mausoleum. One side is an extended graveyard. Tombstones and rocks may provide cover. the other side is a spooky forest. both sides are divided by a river, one side has a bridge, but the other does not. Fun for teams of all sizes, please Download and tell me what you think! :)"

Whats In The Folders:\r\n\r\n1xReadme.txt file\r\n1xtdm_shipment.vmf file\r\n1xtdm_shipment.nav file\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n2.Description:\r\n\r\nThis is a remake(an entirely rebuilt version)of the map called Shipment that was made for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare that I made using the Source SDK from VALVE. I really liked the CODMW map and thought it would be fun not only to play in CSS but also to better my skills in VALVE's Source SDK. My remake is slightly different mostly being that I added a closer crane and a few more trees(I think)and obviously the map is sized and textured different but for the most part it resembles the main idea of what the original map looks like. Though nothing will ever replace the original.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n3.Known Issues:\r\n\r\nFirst off the map is NOT done I'm just trying to get feed back from any body who likes to give others feed back.\r\n\r\nIts also not tailored to be used on line yet.\r\n\r\nIt has lighting issues, as I am not as good in the SDK as I wish I was(yet!)\r\n\r\nSome of the props are out of place. And a few other set pieces need to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nTextures are not 100% fitted to there brushes yet ether!\r\n\r\nUm...Oh! There is no water 0.o! Some times when I work in the editor for to long or some times after I've added to much stuff, any water no matter dx7 or above, nor cheap water or nice water will render after this odd problem first occurs. Not sure why yet but I'm gonna try and figure it out.\r\n\r\nThat is about it I suppose, hopefully you be letting me know whats up/wrong from this point on=)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n4. Why I Made This Map:\r\n\r\nNot much to say that isn't already known about why any body would wanna remake this map...ITS BECAUSE ITS AWESOME! I've seen a ton of remakes and remixes on youtube so I think the original map speaks for its self in the reasons why it deserves to be worshiped(not really I know I'm just kidding)\r\n\r\nAnd that's it...\r\n\r\nThanx for taking the time to check out my map and I hope you ether have playing it or getting to rip/critic it.\r\n\r\nAs always,\r\nArrogant Orange\r\n\r\n\r\nA youtube preview video for your viewing pleasure:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/evDcU5LCtYo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/evDcU5LCtYo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>"

		"_sText": "This map is in development and will any moment be finished.\r\nI released .VMF below which you can use to edit the map or compile it... you will have to add proper spawnpoints. The map works great with bots!\r\n\r\nThis map can be either long range or CQB.... If you choose to stay in buildings you will have CQB. If you stay outside you would rather be carrying long range guns. This map will maybe become a Demolition map! This map also requires teamwork if you don't want to become overrun!\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\nMore advanced lightning is being added\r\nEnhancement of environment (market being built, props in buildings etc... )\r\nFixing some textures :)\r\n\r\nWhich might be considered as bug:\r\nGetting on roofs by jumping on walllights...\r\n> this was possible in SOCOM too (but on another method...\r\n\r\nThe map is somehow rdy to be played, but you will not notice any enerving bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the most played map on a FPS game named SOCOM 2 US Navy SEALs\r\njust google for it\r\n\r\nnow i need comments or suggestions what to add or edit"
