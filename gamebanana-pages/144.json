There is also a sewer system that connects the two houses with plenty of quick exits. The map has great creepy characteristics great for zombie invasions.\r\n\r\n**Secret**: There is a Hondo (old TFC/AHL mapper) inspired secret within the game-play.  Read the map description to figure out the clues to begin the secret.\r\n*Note* When in the secret, don't hesitate to use the \"use\" button to progress though it.\r\n\r\n**The Story to the Secret**\r\n\r\nOnly days ago, Mr Russell (owner of the white house) went missing after the the murder of his wife. Reports state from his neighbor, Mr Durant, that he was last seen on the dock bringing in his boat. The report also indicates that only 20 minutes later, Mr Durant reported hearing someone at his front door. Thinking it was Mr Russell, Mr Durant went to answer, but no one was there.\r\n\r\nEverything about Mr Russell's disappearance and the murder of his wife correlates with the trail of a serial killer who investigators have been in pursuit of for 25 years. This serial killer has always left his murder weapon near the scene, but never left any clue to his exit. Investigators still have yet to locate the weapon at the lake, but are sure it is there somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the killer, you must find his weapons. They will lead you on the path through his memories of murders, and ultimately to him.\r\n\r\n**Preview Video here**: [zm_countrylake](http://youtu.be/y36OEkzVE2c \"zm_countrylake preview\")\r\n\r\nPlease give me input!

I got a solid 40-60 FPS in-game, which I ALWAYS get in CSS.

If you hate HDR so much, DISABLE IT IN YOUR FUCKING VIDEO OPTIONS AND STOP COMPLAINING! And remember, the FPS WILL most likely drop a bit more when there's 12 humans in one camping spot because they fail so much they can't defend themselves and need 1089127312 other people behind them to survive, and especially when they're all constantly firing their mile-long clips and ejecting 100s of shells on the ground.

		"_sText": "Makkon, the original author of this map, is given full credit in his original work. I take credit only in porting his map to Zombie Mod and updating the lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map is small-med and I'd recommend no more than 24 people (that's max anyway). The map is the same exact layout as fk_stalker_concrete, but this one is daytime.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally I only intended this to be a private release at my friend's ZM server but I think other servers may find it useful. The map features camping and a little bit of barricading. Some of the good areas are only accessible by doing  difficult things. \r\n\r\nFor instance:  The metal scaffolding tower at the back left corner of CT spawn has a little suspended metal grate in it that you can get into only if you shoot an oildrum below it, have someone crouch on top of it and boost you up to it. This is a rare occasion because people usually don't cooperate and it's hard to get the oil drum in the right spot and angle. By the time you have it set up to where you can access it, someone is already a zombie, and are probably right next to you. :)\r\n\r\nThere is one secret in the map that I will not give away. All I shall say is that it only works between the first and second minute of each round. After that it becomes constantly working until the round ends. This secret spot is virtually impossible to be penetrated by zombies (unless they get to the secret area before the access to it is closed, or until the zombies wait until the 3rd minute of the round); or on a rare occasion, they are blown towards it by a grenade. Even if the zombies do get to this area, it will still be kind of hard for them to get any players. But again, it usually takes like 10-30 seconds before the first zombie spawns, and you have a rare chance of getting to this said secret area anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map is in Final Beta, so I am releasing it as beta before the Final Final version (Confused?). :D\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that you all enjoy this. And please spare the time to assess if you post or even view and are a registered user here at FPSB. I don't care if your assessment isn't a 10, or a 9, or an 8, or even a 7; AS LONG AS YOU SUPPORT IT AND JUSTIFY WHY YOU GAVE ME THE ASSESSMENT! \r\n\r\nPlease don't just say \"This map is gay\" and give it a 1/10 or something. \r\n\r\nAnd remember, most of the credit goes to Makkon for his original work.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Coming Soon in Final*\r\n\r\n-Improved Volumetric Lighting (more accurate)\r\n\r\n-Full HDR Lighting\r\n \r\n-More spots\r\n\r\n-Brightening of certain dark areas.\r\n\r\n-Improved shadows. A lot of areas are a bit high in lightmap scales. I'll probably just go ape shit and make all the faces have a lightmap scale of 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas!"

Coupled with using fun_details from the very start, the area portal doors have let this map have wildly improved frame rates.  On my junk computer, the average rate is around 40FPS, but I've seen up to 70 in some areas.  On my dedicated server  test players with better comps have reported even better rates.\r\n\r\nThe map has three custom textures packed into it, they're humorous motivational posters and can be found in the security rooms next to T-Spawn.\r\n\r\nThe map itself isn't particularly complicated like it's name suggests, but it's got some very abstract features, such as a barn house outdoors underneath some rooms which can't be seen because the sky is in the way.
