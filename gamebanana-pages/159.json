The middle one is a boss fight and the other two are normal escapes.\r\n\r\n- Also, there are 3 special weapons. (Cool'r and 2 builders).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Enviolinador for the textures and for all the help he provided me.\r\n\r\nThank you for all the feedback provided in the other version.\r\n\r\nV2:\r\n\r\n- Fixed sound files, now you can turn music on/off by using options - audio - music volume.\r\n\r\n- Added a 3D Skybox.\r\n\r\n- Fixed bugs and changed some holding spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nIt's my first ze map, and pretty much the first \"serious\" map I make.

Although the map itself was done in 6 hours, I overslept the two following days and didn't finish it, so I failed at the 1-day thing. I've probably spent 8-10 hours on it at most. \r\n\r\nThe map features puzzles, music, 64-unit blocks for everything, awful mechanics and stupidity. Although I doubt it has -many- bugs it won't be too enjoyable probably. \r\n\r\nThe first puzzle is basketball. You have to throw the dualies with the attached yellow block over the 'basket'. It is easy but needs some practice; as ZE players won't give a shit the map will probably end here with lots of rage and flying turds. You need to get the dualies into the basket twice.\r\n\r\nThen a shitty bridge appears. It induces seizures, kinda, so it's better to wait until it fully opens. \r\n\r\nThen the typical press two buttons at the same time. The map needed more fillers.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the retardation bridges come. They block your WASD control and make you move backwards always so you have to backpedal. You can only move your camera and jump (while on the air you can use WASD) to get past them.\r\n\r\nThere's a few holds and then a physics puzzle. Depending on how you solve it, one of the two possible endings will happen.\r\n\r\nThe map features:\r\n\r\n- Lots of fog\r\n- Unholdable holds, probably\r\n- No special weapons because they're very expensive and the map is poor\r\n- Dev textures because real textures are too complicated\r\n- 64 spawns\r\n- Music\r\n- Radar to make the path more clear since it's a mess\r\n- Awkward, horrid puzzles\r\n- Lame, unfunny console commands\r\n- The root of all evil\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI will not be updating the map probably as it is just terrible, but if the teleports are retarded or something it might happen. Post suggestions and whatever, but the basketball puzzle stays."

First i decompiled the latest version of this map and i have to say it was so badly broken... leaks, overlapping textures, overlapping objects, wierd looking and stretched displacements etc. So, the only way was to completely remake this map. First i made some plans on paper, took some measurements and started mapping. It took me 8th versions to get this so far as it is :) (4beta versions + 4final versions) \r\nTesting took place in I3d zombie escape server (213.163.68.179:27015)\r\nI hope you all enjoy this map!! \r\n===============================\r\nIf you find any mistakes, bugs, then please tell me :)"

		"_sText": "This is my first ZE map, which I made from scratch taking ideas from here and there.\r\n\r\nThere are three different routes which contain different spots to hold and traps, and that lead to the same place: A bridge and then the lab. From the lab you'll be sent to the lower levels of the building and you'll have to go to the old train station to activate the train and escape. You will have to hold the train for 75 seconds, so you'd better prepare well.\r\n\r\nThis map is a typical Zombie Escape map with lots of places where you have to resist and some secrets, including a code-protected door and a rocket launcher.\r\n\r\nTo make gameplay easier, some console messages will tell you what to do, but basically you have to leave in a train before a missile is launched (As in most escape maps)\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
