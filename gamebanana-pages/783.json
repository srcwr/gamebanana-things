Unfortunately, after they arrive at the VIP's location the Terrorists have blocked their exit.  You must make it back to your vehicles to win the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAME PLAY CHANGES:\r\n\r\nThe original version of my map was too biased towards the Terrorist and that was my number one goal to fix when I decided to redo the level.  The overall map layout is very similar but there have been a lot of small tweaks and additions to get rid of any flaws in the game play.  Things such as; lowering window ledges, opening doors, providing more cover, starting closer to the rescue zone, radar with marked locations, darker environment, and adding another rescue zone have drastically evened out the difference between the two teams.  I have also raised the player count to 40 total but I would still suggest you keep it to 32-36 players max.\r\n\r\nGRAPHICS CHANGES:\r\nBesides the game play changes, I went in and re-did a lot of my earlier texture and model work.  The level is much prettier this time around with a lot more custom content and foliage to give things a much fuller and realistic look.  Overall frame rate should be very similar to the original version as I went through and optimized a lot of my shoddy brush work and vis problems.  However, there is a lot of foliage on this level and there are a couple of sections that you can see a LOT of content so your frame rate my dip some if you have an older computer.\r\n"

It is dark, medium to large in size and has a basement and second floor.<br>Terrorists have taken the place to hold their prisoners. Counter-terrorists must intervene in their actions and end them by ambushing the building. The priority, beyond neutralizing enemies, is to safeguard the lives of hostages.<br>I hope my work is to your liking. Any opinion will be duly appreciated. From already, thank you very much!<br><br>Thanks to:<br>-LucasFacu for testing the map and helping me improve it.<br><br>-Patrick de Arteaga for providing me with the music present on the map.<br>(his music is free, visit his page if you like: https://patrickdearteaga.com/es/index-es/).<br><br>-Chesterfield, since from him I was able to get the hostage skins present on the map. The one who ported these skins to CSS was originally vad36. Credits to both for their respective actions.<br><br>NOTE: If you want to uninstall the hostage skins then go to the \"cstrike\" folder of the game, then go to \"custom\" and there delete the folder called \"my_custom_stuff\".

(the hostage don't like the ladders, and I don't know why)\r\n\r\nAnother first for me: - Random Hostage Spawn - They are in the locations you would find the \"Informant\" in americas army, thought it was a nice touch.\r\n\r\nOne last note: Yes I know there are bits and pieces missing or that are different from the original map, due to the limits of the source engine.  I have omitted certain areas that I thought had no \"purpose\" in this game, Not to mention the vast size of the outside/wooded portion of Americas Army map is impossible to reproduce with the Source engine. (at least for me it is...lol)\r\n\r\nOther than that...it's been play tested for about a month. No bugs remain, If you have any issues, or find any bugs. please let me know, and as always your comments are greatly appreciated."

Armed with submachine guns and grenades, they took 105 children and 4 teachers hostage. A short time later, just outside of town, nine heavily armed South Moluccans boarded a commuter train, taking 60 hostages. After 14 long hours, the terrorists begin issuing their political demands. As negotiations dragged on for an interminable two weeks, the Royal Dutch Marines were taking action. The elite counter-terrorism and commando squad used thermal imaging and listening devices to formulate a rescue plan. This double siege is the most famous mission of the Royal Dutch Marines and is still studied by counter-terrorism units worldwide as a textbook example of how to handle a hostage crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Ducht Marinesgive assault during the night with two groups, one  with a vehicle brokes a door from the school and use flashs grenades and the terrorists have been arrest, the other using a heavy gun and snipers , shoot on the wagon. The hostages are supposed sleeping on the ground, and only 3 hostages have been killed and for the terrorist only 1 or 2 still alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map is inspired by these facts , 2 locations where hostages are be detained with two groups of terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe medium size give a fast action but its necessary to proceed with caution if you are CT, as usual its possible to climb on walls...\r\n\r\nMany possibilities to be hidden, the map is well lighted , in the real facts there was no light during the Royal Ducht action.\r\n\r\nThe maps runs well about 32 players \r\n\r\nPoints Nav for Bots are outstanding  made by CHIZBONE, a excellent naver, i recommend him and i give credits for its remarkable works.\r\n\r\nDont forget to buy a nightvision\r\n\r\nEnjoy It"
