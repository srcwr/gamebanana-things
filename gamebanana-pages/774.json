Your task, neutralize any ghosts that inhabit your country by any means necessary.<br><br>You've received reports of paranormal activity around a rural corn farm concerning a small group gentlemen supposedly trapped there by a small group of ghosts.

Flashlights and night-vision goggles are also recommended to be disabled, the lighting in this map is designed very carefully so that the 2 are not necessary, but still manage to keep the ghosts fairly well hidden. Normal gravity is also highly advised, otherwise players will be able to escape outside the map.<br><br><br><dt>Other notes</dt>A nav mesh is included, but it is the one created by default, there are a fair few errors with it with regards to players getting stuck in the basement and such, but hostages tend to cope a lot better.<br><br>For the best games with this map (if playing with bots, alone), I recommend a balance of 2 CT's to 1 Ghost on normal difficulty with the player being on Terrorist (or ghost in this case) team. That's just my advise though, it worked out quite nicely for me. Otherwise, 4 v 4 with humans works very nicely too.<br><br>Any constructive comments and feedback are appreciated, as always."

If the rescue mission is not going well, there is an old cave that you bring the hostages to where they will be safe.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: You were already given a large ransom payment for the hostages but decided to ask for more money.

I also served as a map reviewer for PlanetAVP. \r\nAbout 6 months ago I jumped in the Half Life 2 and CounterStrike arena feet first. It's been a total blast and I love the HL2 world. \r\nIf play AVP2 and would like to check out those maps please PM me.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUnzip the files cs_forest_insurrection_v1.bsp:\r\nSteam\\Steamapps\\<<your username>>\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\\\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n------------\r\nChanging the map name from \"cs_forest_inssurection_v1.bsp\" to anything else will cause\r\nall the special visual effects (specularity) to stop working as the cubemaps have been compiled \r\nfor this map filename only. Basically the map will look like crap if you change it's name.\r\n\r\nHL2 Deathmatch Maps by Redclaw:\r\n------------\r\n\r\ndm_larkhill_detention_cntr_V1.bsp\r\ndm_narnia_hunting_grounds_v5.bsp\r\ndm_forest_vendetta_V1.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_Vendetta_snow_V3.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_vendetta_sun_v3.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_vendetta_war_se_v1.bsp\r\ndm_narnia_llw_winter_storm_v1.bsp\r\n\r\nOther Notes:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me (tachyonrays@hotmail.com) with suggestions and bugs you might find in my maps.\r\n\r\nI run a dedicated server called \"Redclaws Dedicated Source Server\", please come join anytime.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n* COPYRIGHT/PERMISSIONS *\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAuthors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels.\r\n\r\nYou MUST NOT distribute this level UNLESS you INCLUDE THIS FILE WITH\r\nNO MODIFICATIONS. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"

This is the crappiest example of my work, with this map I was just trying to test the engine's capability to pretty much disregard vis. BTW This is compiled with fast vis, it honestly wouldn't matter. If you're gonna lag from this map, you're gonna do it either way, unless you wanna hide in a house the whole round :D.\r\n\r\nMy next maps will be orig. style (precise skybox and vis limitations, not open massive free-roam areas). This was just for fun.\r\n\r\nThere's no real story to the map, make something up, because its fake. Lol jk, I'm not that lame, it's just that this map is called Fellujah yet the majority of the places that are actually recreated in the map are from Israel lmao. I just want people to see this map and be like \"What the fuck is that giant stupid wall\" and maybe they'll actually realize that that giant stupid wall really exists in real life... and if I was the person building this map (the world) I wouldn't have really put it there. :)\r\n\r\nHere's the pictures I based the map off, you'll notice some parts actually look a lot like the pictures, at least I tried! :P.\r\n\r\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/gal.php?g=04baghdadxlarge1a.jpg\r\n\r\nAnyways, Special thanks to Innocent Hawk, SZFlow, Totenkopf, Fps_2k, EoS, and everyone in the community for helping beta test & assess... and shoot me in the face with an awp like 900 times :D.\r\n\r\nCome check out our site & servers, http://www.claneos.com ...our pub server was playing the beta, although we will be most likely be updating to the full version soon. OPERATION DESERT STORM!!!!! -fps :D\r\n\r\nP.S. If you're going to decompile it JUST ASK ME and I'll send you the god damn vmf file (and textures and sounds), I hate when people steal, if a community can't work together it's not very commune is it?.. Ask me here or on the EoS site doesn't matter. :)\r\n\r\n...god last map I released was either for The Specialists.. but I still miss AHL, anyone still out there? ;D\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************************\r\nI was flagged illegal by anonymous (obviously the person who commented innapropriate), so I'd just like to show you some of the decals around this map.\r\nhttp://img156.imageshack.us/i/fellujah028.jpg/ [img]http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6676/fellujah028.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/i/fellujah026.jpg/ [img]http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/3046/fellujah026.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/i/fellujah021.jpg/ [img]http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/7743/fellujah021.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img299.imageshack.us/i/fellujah017.jpg/ [img]http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/6932/fellujah017.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/i/fellujah016.jpg/ [img]http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/7393/fellujah016.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/i/fellujah015.jpg/ [img]http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/1851/fellujah015.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/i/fellujah014.jpg/ [img]http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/3835/fellujah014.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/i/fellujah013.jpg/ [img]http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/825/fellujah013.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img514.imageshack.us/i/fellujah012.jpg/ [img]http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/8797/fellujah012.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/i/fellujah011.jpg/ [img]http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/3011/fellujah011.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/i/fellujah010.jpg/ [img]http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/6581/fellujah010.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/i/fellujah009.jpg/ [img]http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/9245/fellujah009.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/i/fellujah008.jpg/ [img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/184/fellujah008.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img249.imageshack.us/i/fellujah007.jpg/ [img]http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/3654/fellujah007.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/i/fellujah006.jpg/ [img]http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5744/fellujah006.th.jpg[/img]\r\n"

The geometry was also built by the author based on information found freely around the world wide web.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 hostages in the house. CT forces have the advantage of a quicker trip to the hostages, but terrorists can use the many terraces and exits of the house to take out the CTs. Due to the nature of the building, there are multiple ways to approach and defend the house, making each round different.\r\n\r\nThe performance is still far from optimal, specially when it comes to long-range battles. Hopefully, this map will be more playable as computers become more powerful, who knows. There are several occluders placed to help performance but they don't help as much as we would like... Use HDR only if your computer can handle it. The LDR lighting looks a bit more yellow while the HDR has a prettier orange light. This could be fixed with another 5 hour compile, so I'm sorry if you don't like how the LDR version looks.\r\n\r\nA lot of graphical changes were done to the map. Higher-res pictures, more accurate stone textures, better lighting using smoothing groups, HDR and fixed \"most\" of the lightmap grid problems. Most of the windows and doors now use 2D textures to help with performance. It might not look as good as the HL2 version in that sense, but good performance was seen as more important. The river now uses a new custom material which is refractive, scrolling and mildly reflective. It looks better than the static HL2 water, fits the situation better and also helps with performance."
