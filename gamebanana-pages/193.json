Feel free to download it**\r\n\r\n**The old version can be found [here](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/160178 \"Ba_Jail_Cavewalk_pb\").**\r\n\r\nCavewalk_v2 is under development! It features larger, yet more simple layout for better game play. You can follow the progress [here](http://gamebanana.com/wips/44618 \"Ba_Jail_Cavewalk_v2 - WIP\").\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy latest jailbreak map. This version is drastically different from the first pre-beta release. Almost all areas have been redesigned to meet the standards of modern jailbreak maps. \r\n\r\nThis map started out as a spare time project and ended up as fully functional jailbreak map. Theme of the map is an old underground mining, that has been transformed into a prison for the most dangerous inmates ever.\r\n\r\nThis version of Cavewalk features a completely new layout, which is much more simple compared to the old one. Every tunnel is quite well lit and a lot wider than before. Many secrets still remain for players to explore. \r\n\r\n<legend>Map features...</legend>\r\n\r\n- Armory\r\n- 12 Cells with 4 spawns each (Except vent cell which has 2)\r\n- Large cell area with many places for prisoners to go to\r\n- Medic with two healing beds\r\n- Jump Rope (With Start-Stop function)\r\n- Hot potato \r\n- Dodgeball (With Start-Stop function)\r\n- Colors (With Start-Stop function)\r\n- Climb that changes every round (3 different ones)\r\n- Watch your Head! (With Start-Stop function)\r\n- Vents leading to various places\r\n- Breakable fence that lets you to armory trough a vent\r\n- Hidden guns (Psst! There's a few bodies around the map with glocks...)\r\n- Underground mining theme with random ambient sounds and ground shake\r\n- Random weapon system which spawns a set of random weapons in certain cells\r\n- Hidden flashbangs that have some effects on them\r\n- Some melons you can drop on prioners!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map itself is medium size, with no useless areas. All games are labeled and there's signs in the tunnels that guide players to them. FPS should be quite high regardless of the position. If you however suffer from low fps, I suggest you to tweak your graphics settings. Bear in mind that disabling HDR will result in a darker atmosphere.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFeedback is much appreciated, as always. I do ask you to spend some time testing the map and writing the feedback as it helps me the most. If you decide to rate the map I'd to like hear why you did/didn't like it. Any low ratings without justification will be removed.\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading this map. If you have any questions, suggestions or such feel free to share them with me!"

Currently as prebeta, since I'd like to have some more feedback of the map before I start developing next version. This version is playable, but It may contain some major or minor bugs that might effect game play.\r\n\r\nStarted out as a misc project and ended up as fully functional jailbreak map. Map's theme is an old underground mining, that has been transformed into a prison for the baddest inmates ever. \r\n\r\nCavewalk has many areas and secrets (+30) for you to explore. Some of them are pretty much little Easter Eggs, but some are bit bigger and harder to find. Also to keep the game play fun, I've added some different effects and minigames. \r\n<legend>Map's content</legend>\r\n\r\n- Armory, 12 CT spawns, lots of weapons\r\n- Cellblock, 8 Cells / 24 T spawns, 2 secrets in cells\r\n- Mainhall, Control room, 2 secrets\r\n- Medic\r\n- Cafeteria\r\n- Minigames: Climb\r\n\r\nMap itself is kind a big and the layout might be complex in players' opinion, but as you play it, you'll learn it. FPS was hard to keep around 60, because the huge amount of details. The map is optimized to it's best, so if you have low fps (below 30) around the map, I suggest adjusting your graphic settings to lower values.\r\n\r\nFeedback is much appreciated, as always. But I ask you to really spend some time testing the map and writing the feedback. If you rate the map, I want to hear why did you like/not like it. All ratings without justification will be removed. \r\n\r\nThank you. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."
