It includes a whole swathe of over 100 fixes and improvements, not including the visual overhaul and 2 new stages!<br><br><h2>What is ze_bioshock?</h2>As the name suggests, ze_bioshock is a zombie escape map themed around the underwater city of Rapture from the games series Bioshock. It features some true-to-the-original locations and layouts, as well as some custom ones, lots of custom items, and is in total around 40 minutes of content.<br><br><h2>What features does it have?</h2>Well, the feature list is too long to list in its entirety, so here are a few highlights:<br><ul><li>5 unique stages, spanning 4 memorable locations from Bioshock (Welcome, Fort Frolic, Arcadia, Hephaestus)</li><li>Difficulty scaler - the map makes itself easier if the humans are having a hard time</li><li>6 player items (Plamsids) - Electro Bolt, Incinerate, Cyclone Trap, Insect Swarm, Winter Blast and Gravity Well</li><li>2 player pickups (Gene Tonics) - Static Shell and Flash Flare</li><li>2 zombie items (Big Daddy/Bouncer and Little Sister)</li><li>Multiple boss fights</li><li>Permanent player-independent item upgrades</li><li>Multiple endings</li></ul><br>There is so much more than the above. Now would you kindly give it a playthrough!<br><br><h2>What's new in v6?</h2>Well, I've packed a full changelog in the map, so unpack it if you want to know it all, as there is far too much to list here. I've also included some technical documentation about how some of the cooler features of the map work, as well as some tips on how to play it better, as playthrough of v5_6 made the same mistakes over and over again. I also included a worklog spanning my day-to-day progress from start to finish of v6. While I don't expect 99% of players to look at these, the more vocal 1% may be able to make a difference.<br><br>But anyway, here are the biggest new changes in this release:<ul><li>Complete visual overhaul, load more detail, new textures, models, sounds and particles</li><li>Introduced a warmup round to allow players to download/connect, combined with a redesigned spawn</li><li>Stage 2 has been completely reworked into a new location - Fort Frolic</li><li>Stage 4 only has the bomb building on Hard difficulty. It becomes a linear stage on Easy mode</li><li>Added a final extra-stage named 1999 (a Bioshock Infinite reference)</li><li>Introduced upgradeable Plasmids. Upgrades are permanent, and independant of the player using it.</li><li>2 new plasmids, and 2 new item types (Gene Tonics), 2 playable zombie characters</li><li>Addressed a massive number of balancing issues</li></ul><br>I want to be done with this map for good soon, so thanks for looking, and please report any bugs found.<br><br>Special Thanks:<br><ul><li>2K Games</li><li>Servers: i3D, GFL, UNLOZE</li><li>Everyone else who helped out in any way</li></ul><br>Thank you for playing."

The story :\nThe zombies are everywhere, your only issue is the barrage, leave the road by 2 different ways :\n\n- an old house\n- a gas station\nJoin the barn of wood in the forest and defend a bridge\nAnd to finish blow up the barrage to drown the zombies.\n\n\n[A nice video with the map](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1zfTR7ivVY \"A nice video with my map\")\n\nNew map post on gamebanana because the new version of the site didn't allow me to upload on the other (upload limit reach)\n\nSpec :\n\n- 64 Players\n- 2 different ways\n- Cubemaps\n- Particles\n- differents difficulties depending the numbers of CT \n\n___________________________________________________________\nV1 : \n\n- reduce the road running (around 30s)\n- 20s less of defense on gas station and house\n- 10s more at the bridge\n- 2 bridges now\n- only one batiment to defend at the end, with different entries\n- some trees modifications\n- some modifications in the barn\n- force defending entry of the barn with bloker on the ladders and the handtruck couldn't move anymore\n- 15s of defense at the entry of the barn and 45s for all instead 1 minute\n- Reduction of the size of the bsp to 140 Mo (B4_2 size was 155 and B1 was 189)\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nBeta4 modifications :\n\n- more fog for optimization\n- Optimization of the entities to avoid crash server\n- Modification of roads for optimization also\n- Increase the number of cars at the biginning to avoid a meeting of zm in the crossing\n- Addition of security rails at the beginning on the invisible walls\n- Reduction of the time of blocking the zm in the crossing\n- fix the blocking too, because zm can pass it before the first zm spawn\n- Modify on the house, it is not possible any more to go on the roof if the door is locked, but there is one little pass through a window\n- Modify of the boards of the house, they are outside now\n- Modify on the gas station: explosion of gas pumps happens before the tank explosion\n- Addition of a teleport to avoid that zombies jam with objects not to be pushed away when the gas station explode\n- Modify of timer on the station and the house: 15s the time which that closes and 1 min to defend\n- New part in the hill where it is necessary to defend a barn with wood\n- The opening of 2 buildings to be defended is at 16 players instead of 12 + very visible warning message!\n- Addition of box after the barriers of entry of buildings\n- Blocking of the access to the roof as long as the trapdoor is not opened \n- The roof ladder breaks at the same time as barriers at the entry, do not wait for a long time on ground\n- Modify of the explosion of the dam\n- Addition of a sound of electricity for the electrocution of the losers\n- Addition of 30s on the map\n- trigger of the computer even if nobody press the button but there will be no messages and it is necessary to wait 40s furthermore!\n- Reduction of the size of the map of 10 Mb\n- Modification in capital letter of messages and reduction of the number\n\n********************\nBeta 3 modifications :\nFixing crash map when the players exceed 20, i've test the new version with succes for 3 hours with 32 bots, and 70 rounds later it's still working. on beta2 it previously crash after 2 or 3 rounds.\nI've also make some optimizations.\n\n\n*******************\nBeta 2  modifications :\nCorrection of 2 bugs : 1 teleporter doesn't work so the afk aren't killed and you could go the left batiment at the end by passing over the fence\nI've reduct the map size from 182 mo to 165 mo\nModification, add and remove of objects\nYou can't go to press the last button until the bidge is broken\nI've reduct hp on the gas and house wood fence\nAnd better protection on the colline part\n*******************"

You can make things easier by taking the helicopter on top of the station or take the train itself. Your escape area is the pyramid and you will need to defend it until someone opens the doors back where you started. You can activate the door by taking the helicopter and going on the roof or taking the train and rushing the zombies as the train makes its way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map should offer something a little different than your normal reach from point A to point B but that isn't for me to decide. Hopefully it brings some fun!\r\n\r\nAs a zombie, you're able to pick up rocket launchers in the second door and able to knock out people inside the helicopter! The more damage you do, the less control the helicopter has. The train has a cannon launcher as well which can **OHKO **aiming well at the helicopter blades... as well as any humans!\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n==================\r\n\tb5 - Initial release.\r\n---\r\n\tb6 - Balance changes with vehicles/items being made more cheap. New crates spawn throughout the map to help you playing as a human. Less damage from zombie items and cannonball has less range. The 'barrier' to protect you from these while holding the pyramid is bigger. Upon reaching the end as zombie you will have significantly lower health and should cut the time on killing any remaining zombies inside the pyramid. Hopefully solved the 'random' crash problems?\r\n---\r\n\tb7 - Napalm launcher for humans, ignite and burn zombies down. Minigun available on top of the pyramid at random when a certain amount of players are connected, more zombie rocket launchers will appear as well! Helicopter extra buttons are removed now with no more cruise control settings (Players can no longer spam the buttons). Use Mouse2 when controlling the helicopter to toggle easier flying! The ceiling level is increased in the map as well given the little new feature."

The Mother Zombie appears after 28 seconds (map forced). He has just few seconds to cut many people before being trapped (and the others).\r\nThen, the players go to a door that closes, and they go to escape Aperture Science. They must first activate the pistons (one goes there and the others must cover, if not : addios !). in order to climb on and reach the ladder.\r\nThen, they had to climb up to very fast pistons. They must activate the console and cover for 25 seconds until the explosion of the pistons.\r\nAfter disabling the other pistons, they discover the most difficult room of the map : there will be many dead and zombies).\r\nIndeed, they will climb the pistons to reach and climb the ladders. Humans have 50 seconds before the release of zombies, or 10 seconds if one go in the top.\r\nMoreover, a small course on pipes (be careful : no fall into the water) with piston and cover point.\r\nThe map end in a lift where humans must prevent the zombies to climb in, followed by a slow rise with the song 'Cara Mia', the turret choir of Portal 2.\r\nThe map is punctated with french voice of Cave Johnson.\r\n\r\nFrançais :\r\n\r\nDescription complète :\r\nCette map débute dans une salle de test de Aperture Science. Le zombie mère apparaît après 28 secondes (forcé par la map). Il a juste quelques secondes pour cut un maximum de personnes avant d'être mis en prison (lui et les autres).\r\nLes joueurs se dirigent alors vers une porte qui se ferme et ils se retrouvent dans les confins de Aperture. Ils doivent en premier lieu activer les pistons (un seul y va les autres covers sinon adios), pour pouvoir grimper dessus et atteindre l'échelle.\r\nEnsuite, un petit parcours assez simple pour les faire grimper jusqu’à de nombreux pistons très rapides. Ils doivent activer la console et cover pendant 25 secondes, jusqu'à l'explosion des pistons.\r\nAprès la désactivation de deux autres piston, vient la salle la plus dur de la map : il y aura de nombreux morts ou zm.\r\nEn effet, il faudra grimper sur des pistons en mouvement pour atteindre les échelles. C'est pas facile, on peut se faire écraser ou tomber (les humains on 50 secondes pour monter avant la libération des zombies, sauf si un humain atteint le haut, ils ont alors 10 secondes).\r\nEnsuite un petit parcours sur des tubes (attention à ne pas tomber dans l'eau) avec un piston a désactivé et un point de cover.\r\nLa map se termine dans un ascenseur où les humains doivent empêcher les zombies de monter dedans, suivit d'une montée lente au rythme de \"Cara Mia\", la musique de fin de Portal 2.\r\nLa map est ponctuée de phrases idiotes de Cave Johnson."

		"_sText": "I started making this map about a week and a half ago, on and off. I wanted to do the map as a follow-up of my other recent ZE map Taboo Carnation but, instead of starting over from the first level no matter what, I wanted to have a Life system like in Contra or similar run 'n gun games. I felt tired of the map, however, and just completed it as a normal ZE map with no items and no bosses.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay should be rather straightforward. The map contains 3 chapters, each of them increasingly hard (I hope) with built cubemaps and ambience. The music is different for each chapter too, and so is the path. \r\n\r\nI might do a new version soon including the life system and a 'hard' mode for once it is beaten with less lives for starters and little or no one-ups appearing.\r\n\r\nEverything should work but, as I don't trust myself and vehicles in source are a bit messy, if the ending chopper kills you I am not to blame.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe chapters are:\r\n\r\n - I : Ascension\r\n - II : A touch of heaven\r\n - III : The womb\r\n\r\nOn the first two chapters you advance towards the core of the fortress and to the mountain side so you can see the entire continent below. The third chapter, being the opposite, is all about getting down and rushing out to get the chopper.\r\n\r\nThe estimated lengths of each chapter if you aren't pants-on-head level dumbo is 6:45, 6:30 and 7:45 minutes:seconds respectively. If you surpass that limits by more than 1 minute you should seek medical assistance or, better yet, a well trained neurologist.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI might release the .vmf with the next/final version. You're allowed to decompile and do whatever you wish with the map. I don't like being creditted, please don't do it. \r\n\r\nThis map contains no particles that can be stolen, so you can't get custom.pcf, map_weapons.pcf or map_details.pcf from here. Life's tough for you if you wanted to claim them as yours.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n### CUSTOM CVARS\r\n### ____________\r\n(Fake cvars that can be added to a config file for the map; they work as a normal cvar but they communicate with the map and let you modify how it works)\r\n\r\n\r\n**antartika\\_force\\_stealth**\r\n\r\n Forces the map to always run on Infiltration mode. \r\n \r\n NPCs will spawn, although the map will not change much aside from that\r\n since the NPCs should be enough of a difficulty boost anyway.\r\n\r\n Take note that Chapter 3 has those vents that hurt you if you jump straight...\r\n \r\n**blizard\\_mode\\_enable and blizard\\_mode\\_disable**\r\n\r\n Enable/disable the blizard -hard- mode. Blizard mode adds a bit of difficulty\r\n by applying multipliers on zombie classes.\r\n\r\n Muultipliers applied:\r\n\r\n \tHealth: \t4.0\r\n\tSpeed:\t\t1.05\r\n\tKnockback: \t0.8\r\n\r\n The multipliers can be modified by writing your own blizzard_overwrite.cfg file.\r\n\r\n The mode also features a few visual changes (CC, clouds) and environmental (thunder sounds)"

		"_sText": "Hey guys, Aero here, with my very first map, like ever.\r\n\r\nHope you guys will like this map, because I certainly had a fantastic time making it. It was a little frustrating, but I am pleased with what came out. \r\n\r\nSorry for the net_graph in the screenshots, I forgot to turn it off, but they really don't cover anything important, so I don't think it's a big deal. Sorry if it offends some people. :P\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECS:\r\nThis is a 48-man escape map. \r\n\r\nThis map will start you out in front of a strange white building. It's your first real test of courage. Which platforms are solid? Which ones break? Will you fall into the poisoned water? Well, I guess you're just going to have to find out the hard way.\r\n\r\n(Note: the wall on the entry side is a ladder for you to exit the water. I'm not that cruel)\r\n\r\nThen you have to face the first labyrinth. It's pretty tame, not too difficult. Reach the center and be whisked to the next task.\r\n\r\nThe center teleport will carry players to a randomly selected labyrinth. There are three in total. Players will need to navigate these labyrinths and make it to the ending point, where they will be treated to some alcohol, and some dance music--complete with a stripper pole for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n(PROTIP: To get into the stripper box, shoot the area above the television set, then enter the door next to the bar. To exit the stripper box, well, there's an exit sign.)\r\n\r\nOr, if you choose to hide from the zombies, parking it deep within the labyrinths is a good way to do it. You might die from the nuke, but at least you didn't turn into a zombie.\r\n\r\nThough I have not pictured it here, there is also a secret \"safe zone\" that can be accessed from two points on the map. Though, you will need to find those on your own. I don't reveal my secrets!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime to give credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS:\r\n\r\nHelix - for all the time he spent testing my map and telling me what I needed to fix, and for helping me with a large portion of it. He is super cool, yo!\r\n\r\nWestsid3r - for the nuke prefab I used (http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1848)... it came in handy, because I know I couldn't have done it myself. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, my friends over at the Huggable Gaming ZM server (8.9.15.203:27015) for testing all 6 previous versions of my map. Sorry for all the trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOPLAH! :) that's about all there is to it. Download and enjoy.\r\n\r\n"

Most danger areas, feature cat walks and other high areas, allowing humans to knock zombies down and away from them, with teamwork what seems impossible may very well only be improbable.\r\n\r\nAt times multiple objectives will be up at once, and it will be up to the players to decide in what order they wish to tackle them.\r\n\r\nThe next to last objective is kind of a mini game, failure can cause death for anyone who tries to complete it. If the humans take to long doing it, or are unable to, then they will simply be overrun by zombies.\r\n\r\nThis map features a side objective where you must obtain food for the escape, otherwise a nasty surprise awaits.....\r\n\r\nin an attempt to clear up any confusion, ive included a grainy walkthrough! plz check it out if you have any questions about the objective structure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MOX6FX8kpI&feature=youtu.be"

The history of the beta version that was \"one base on a bottom of the sea\" no longer applies, because we change the end of the map, is now based on a secret military base that was destroyed by a deadly virus. Good. I will cite some changes on the map:\r\n\r\n- Added more ammo in the guns of the map.\r\n \r\n- The doors never close.\r\n\r\n- Time nuke is activated when it gets close to the boats.\r\n\r\n- FOG and SkyBox map have changed.\r\n\r\n- Buttons of the doors that did not work in another room, now work.\r\n\r\n- New changes in the structure of the map.\r\n\r\n- Brightness of the map changed.\r\n\r\n- Balancing entire map.\r\n\r\n- Reduced time.\r\n\r\n- Light marking the buttons on the map.\r\n\r\n- Power Room Door opens automatically.\r\n\r\n- Improvements on the map.\r\n\r\n- Anti AFK on the safe room.\r\n\r\n- Power Room have new structure.\r\n\r\n- The nukes have shake now.\r\n\r\n- New means of escape.\r\n\r\n- Base TR and CT are now together and their structures were modified.\r\n\r\n- Was removed the time of 15 seconds the engine room on the second part of the map.\r\n\r\nThe map has more changes that can only be seen playing the map.
