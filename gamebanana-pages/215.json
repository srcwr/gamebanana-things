(Clickly)](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ghosts_group \"Clicky\")\r\n\r\nBasic Info\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis is a re-make of an original mg map. http://gamebanana.com/css/maps/153563\r\n\r\nI have completely re-made the map for a competition in plaguefest.com\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n============\r\n\r\nYou start in the spawn area. From there there are two randomizing platform which you jump to (,only one platform is active at a time), and then go to the island in the spawn area with portals. These portals give you power-ups and the ability to build the map.\r\n\r\nPower Ups\r\n=========\r\n\r\n###### Ninja \r\nGives you 20% visibility during the game so you can try and sneak around the enemy\r\n###### Roof Sniper\r\nGives you access to the roof which is perfect for sniping. Also give you 300hp, which is enough to take a few hits. You can drop down a hole to get into the map and play with your 300 hp that way. The sniper roof breaks after a certain amount of time.\r\n###### Wall builder\r\nYou are teleported to the start area, on your next spawn you will start on top of the map with an ability to spawn walls under you to build the arena. To build simply look down so you can see where you are placing them and press +attack to spawn walls under you. At the end of the building time you will be teleported back to the spawn and play normally.\r\n###### Floor Builder\r\nYou are teleported to the start arena, on your next spawn you will start on top of the map with an m4. With this m4 you can shoot down under you, where your bullet hits a piece of ground will spawn under you. You will start in your spawn building as normal once building timer hits 0.\r\n###### Music DJ\r\nYou get teleported to a DJ room with a sophisticated music picking system. There are instructions there so you can easily pick a track. Once you pick a track you will be teleported to the start building.\r\n\r\nSecrets\r\n==================\r\n- There is a hidden secret grenade which heals you while you hold it, cannot be combined with other perks.\r\n- The is a hidden song, which I doubt you will find without me showing you or without you decompiling the map\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n==================\r\n- Sometimes people retain the super speed from the builder (count it as a bonus for building)\r\n- Sometimes portal does not de-activate after some-one walks through\r\n\r\nA Final Note\r\n============\r\nShow your appreciation of my maps by joining my steam group here!\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/ghosts_group\r\n\r\nThis helps me know people appreciate my maps and is where I announce new maps! Also this is where I release map I dont upload to GB!"

They CT spawn with no weps and must run to the end without getting killed. Once reaching the end they can pick up grenades in which to throw inside the slots of the Terrorist boxes and blow them up. The glass in which the CT can see T on the top is only one sided. So the T has no idea where you are. The map features a helicopter noise in the beginning and has lighting effect. The secret room includes a lobby with a trail grenade, couches, ipads, music booth, and hot tub. The other room includes a Disco room that has a DJ booth, a bar, and a dance floor. There is a secret music button in this map somewhere. Where is it and what is it? You'll just have to find it yourself. This took some good time of work even though some of you out there can probably do way better than me. But hey, I'm new to mapping ok? Enjoy as much as you want\r\n\r\nNote: Most fun with 8+ people\r\n\r\nTodo List: v2 including grenade fix in which you can get more grenades without having to be far away from it first and glitching."

		"_sText": "**Be aware:** Changes in this version are minimal and it has mainly been released as an attempt at fixing the team switcher in time for Halloween. The map will receive a lot more updates, and potentially even a CS:GO port some time soon. If you have good ideas for improvements PLEASE message me either on here, or YouTube (which I check almost every day) http://www.youtube.com/SpyWhoLovedHimself I **WILL** take your suggestions very seriously. Those who have criticism, definitely message me with ways I can make it more enjoyable for you, I want to make this map fun for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Message\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nCrazy to think I first released this map Halloween of 2009 (3 whole years ago) and have been further developing it on and off ever since! Thank you to those who have supported me and this map throughout! I know it's a bit like Marmite, some will love it, whilst some don't enjoy Hide & Seek (I am always trying to improve the gameplay to make it more fun for those players, hence the CT knife). But to everyone who has messaged me to tell me how much they love the map, thank you... That's what makes it all worth it to me! I take all suggestions very seriously, without user input it wouldn't be where it is now... Again, thanks.\r\n\r\n- Starving Hobo\r\n\r\nP.S. If you have a few friends with mic, try playing this map at night in a small private server. Alltalk on. I personally think it's the most fun played that way :)\r\n\r\n\r\nFright Night: Part 2 (Fix: V3)\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAbout the map:\r\n\r\nIt functions as a hide and seek map with a few twists.  Counter-Terrorists spawn with no weapons and must hide and avoid being killed by the Terrorists who must hunt them down and kill them.  There is a three minute time limit, after which the Terrorists will be killed and swapped with Counter-Terrorists.  There is a maximum of three Terrorists who play as Leatherface, Jack Torrance and Freddy Krueger, each gets a special weapon apart from Freddy, but Freddy can play scary music by right clicking after a certain amount of time has passed.  It is set up to be like a horror movie with some areas being based on movie scenes, such as the kitchen (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), bathroom (The Shining), tool shed (The Evil Dead), maze (The Shining) and the \"bookshelf\" door (horror cliché).\r\n\r\nThere is a single knife which spawns in the tool shed after a random amount of time each round.  When a Counter-Terrorist picks it up he assumes the character of Ash (The Evil Dead) with matching quotes on right click.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrorists: 3\r\nCounter-Terrorists: 29\r\n\r\nMaximum of 32 players.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-BLOCK SERVER PLUGIN VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PLAYING THIS MAP\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog [CURRENT VERSION] (mg_frightnight_final_v3):\r\n\r\n- REDRUM added to bathroom door\r\n- Title screen music fixed\r\n- Team switcher altered as the old one did not work\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog [CURRENT VERSION] (mg frightnight final v2):\r\n\r\n- Team switcher, switches Terrorists with surviving Counter-Terrorists if Terrorists lose\r\n- Added new tool shed\r\n- Added a knife which spawns in the tool shed\r\n- Added Evil Dead quotes (Ash) for the CT knife\r\n- New exit from the mansion in the bookshelf secret compartment, locked if there is only one Terrorist\r\n- New Jack Torrance quote when trying to open a locked bathroom door as Jack\r\n- Leatherface screams and cries like in the movies\r\n- Fixed ghost, new scarier model\r\n- 3 ghostly experiences to find\r\n- Alternate Freddy music (there are now two tracks)\r\n- New intro view, very horror movie-esque title credit roll\r\n- Various added detail including a head in a saucepan in the kitchen\r\n- Attic extended again with a secret compartment at the back\r\n- Attic lighting dimmed\r\n- Counter-Terrorists can't get a Terrorist weapon anymore\r\n- Fixed bug where a Terrorist could use a flashlight\r\n- Fixed attic window glitch\r\n- Added 3D skybox (credit thegregster101)\r\n- Altered fog settings\r\n- Secrets more user friendly (e.g. door lock pulsates before use to make it more obvious)\r\n- New skybox texture (credit Hip Shot)\r\n- \"Cheap\" hiding spot in the maze lit\r\n- \"Cheap\" hiding spot in the gallery lit\r\n- \"Here's Johnny!\" quote can only be used once every 30 seconds now (used to be 10)\r\n- Axe now also swings on right click\r\n- Axe can't be spammed anymore\r\n- TV may or may not come on at random intervals instead of always turning on every 100 seconds\r\n- Small cubemap fixes\r\n- Added more hiding places in attic\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog 2010 (mg frightnight final):\r\n\r\n- Added cellar with trap door into maze\r\n- Scream sound effect when the first Counter-Terrorist is murdered.\r\n- Soundscapes to make the rain quieter inside\r\n- Window models added on the back of the house\r\n- Attic smaller and lit\r\n- Bathroom door can be knifed anywhere to break it down in sequence\r\n- Round time shortened to 3 minutes to cut down waiting time for dead players\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog 2009 (mg frightnight beta2):\r\n\r\n- Quotes for all terrorist players by right clicking\r\n- Terrorists have a chainsaw, axe, and knife (no glove model for Freddy exists)\r\n- Living room TV plays the video from The Ring, and illuminates the room\r\n- Awesome thunder weather effects\r\n- Closet on the second floor of the mansion you can hide in\r\n- Flashlights disabled\r\n\r\n\r\nMap Story\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nIt's 3 minutes to midnight on Halloween! A group of CTs have seeked refuge from the storm in an old haunted mansion. Just when everything seemed okay, a huge lightning bolt struck three graves outside of the mansion! Shocked, the CTs watched outside, as three killers rose from their graves wielding scary looking weapons! The CTs desperately searched for their own weapons but remembered that they had lost them a long way back! The murderers have just 3 minutes until Halloween ends and they must return to their graves for another year, but can the CTs survive for that long as they are chased and taunted in the dark scary mansion?!\r\n\r\n\r\nGhost Hunting Side Quest\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThere are 3 ghost sightings hidden in this map. The ghost is of the caretaker (you can find his hanging corpse in the tool shed basement). If you want a little ghost hunting fun see if you can find them all. One of the sightings is only enabled on certain rounds randomly (1/6 chance).\r\n\r\nVideo Showing Secrets & Lesser Known Gameplay Features\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n**Warning: Ghost hunt spoilers.**\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSC7Mb1-g3Y\r\n\t<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YSC7Mb1-g3Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nTrivia (A.K.A. sh*t nobody cares about)\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n- The map was originally going to be a spooky version of item battle until during play-testing, one of the players without a weapon commented that it was really scary being chased without any way to defend himself.\r\n- The attic of the original map prior to release was the full length of the room and completely pitch black, terrorists would run around using radar to find any CTs hiding up there.\r\n- Before the gameplay was changed from item battle, the crypt outside was going to be an entrance to a ghost train which would take players around the map and through the mansion.\r\n- The TV works by using a series of doors, a logic_timer and a LOT of hard work syncing it with the original video (it used to have audio)... The title screen works the same way."

With friends\r\n. With mic\r\n. With alltalk on (sv_alltalk 1)\r\n\r\nIt's nowhere near as good when nobody uses mic. It's best when everyone is creeping each other out and getting jumpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists have no weapons and must survive for 3 minutes by hiding and running from the three Terrorists who play as famous movie killers, Freddy Krueger (the knife), Leatherface (the chainsaw) and Jack Torrance (the axe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n. The bathroom door can be locked with a bolt on the inside of the door. When it is locked, the Terrorists can only get in by breaking one pane of the door which mirrors a scene from The Shining.\r\n\r\n. By right clicking as a Terrorist, the players who are Freddy Krueger and Jack Torrance can shout movie quotes. Freddy does an evil laugh taken from the school scene in the original Nightmare On Elm Street, and Jack Torrance shouts \"Here's Johnny!\" Which is a famous quote from the bathroom scene of The Shining. After a certain time period, right clicking as Freddy will play tense chase music from the original Nightmare On Elm Street movie. Leatherface doesn't have a special quote or function, but the chainsaw is always buzzing which scares Counter-Terrorists as it gets closer!\r\n\r\n. There is a closet on the second floor which can be opened and Counter-Terrorists can hide inside if they are feeling brave!\r\n\r\n. The living room is in pitch black and is a good hiding spot until the TV comes on. The TV plays the video seen in The Ring, and illuminates the room.\r\n\r\n. Other similar events can light up rooms and make Counter-Terrorists easy to spot, for example, upstairs there are two windows from which the room is illuminated from when the lightning strikes.\r\n\r\n. Flashlights are disabled by default. Terrorists search by standing far back to see players in the fog, or by hovering their crosshair over the darkness in suspect locations until names appear.\r\n\r\n. When playing Counter-Terrorist, it is best to choose to be the SAS otherwise your visor may be visible in the darkness!\r\n\r\n. The resident ghost lives in the attic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW:\r\n\r\n. There is now a cellar.\r\n\r\n. By going in the cupboard in the cellar, you can go through a secret tunnel and through a trap door in the maze.\r\n\r\n. Time limit shortened to cut down long waiting times when dead.\r\n\r\n. A scream is heard when the first CT is murdered.\r\n\r\n. Soundscapes added which make the rain quieter inside.\r\n\r\n. Secret hiding location by opening a bookcase which is really a door in the first floor library.\r\n\r\n. Window models added on the back of the house to improve looks.\r\n\r\n. The door can now be knifed anywhere and the pane will break down in sequence.\r\n\r\n. Attic is smaller with a small light on one side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\nStarving Hobo\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors, problems, or you have any suggestions for the next release, please contact me by sending me a PM on my YouTube account, http://www.youtube.com/spywholovedhimself/ as I check it regularly. Thanks! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It's best when everyone is creeping each other out and getting jumpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists have no weapons and must survive for 4 minutes by hiding and running from the three Terrorists who play as famous movie killers, Freddy Krueger (the knife), Leatherface (the chainsaw) and Jack Torrance (the axe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n. The bathroom door can be locked with a bolt on the inside of the door.  When it is locked, the Terrorists can only get in by breaking one pane of the door which mirrors a scene from The Shining.\r\n\r\n. By right clicking as a Terrorist, the players who are Freddy Krueger and Jack Torrance can shout movie quotes.  Freddy does an evil laugh taken from the school scene in the original Nightmare On Elm Street, and Jack Torrance shouts \"Here's Johnny!\"  Which is a famous quote from the bathroom scene of The Shining.  After a certain time period, right clicking as Freddy will play tense chase music from the original Nightmare On Elm Street movie.  Leatherface doesn't have a special quote or function, but the chainsaw is always buzzing which scares Counter-Terrorists as it gets closer!\r\n\r\n. There is a closet on the second floor which can be opened and Counter-Terrorists can hide inside if they are feeling brave!\r\n\r\n. The living room is in pitch black and is a good hiding spot until the TV comes on.  The TV plays the video seen in The Ring, and illuminates the room.\r\n\r\n. Other similar events can light up rooms and make Counter-Terrorists easy to spot, for example, upstairs there are two windows which the room is illuminated from when the lightning strikes.\r\n\r\n. Flashlights are disabled by default.  Terrorists search by standing far back to see players in the fog, or by hovering their crosshair over the darkness in suspect locations until names appear.\r\n\r\n. When playing Counter-Terrorist, the GSG-9 is a bad class to pick as the visor is usually visible even in the darkness, but players who are brave can pick this class!\r\n\r\n. The resident ghost lives in the attic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\nStarving Hobo\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors, problems, or you have any suggestions for the next release, please contact me by sending me a PM on my YouTube account, http://www.youtube.com/spywholovedhimself/ as I check it regularly.  Thanks! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is 4 minutes to midnight on Haloween!  A group of CTs have seeked refuge from the storm in an old haunted mansion.  Just when everything seemed okay, a huge lightning bolt struck three graves outside of the mansion!  Shocked, the CTs watched outside, as three killers rose from their graves wielding scary looking weapons!  The CTs desperately searched for their own weapons but remembered that they had lost them a long way back!  The murderers have just 4 minutes until Haloween ends and they must return to their graves for another year, but can the CTs survive for that long as they are chased and taunted in the dark scary mansion?!\""
