So we created our own edit of DeathRun called ExplosiveRun\r\n\r\nOk im sure you wonder how you play it. here it is\r\n\r\nEveryone starts at the same spawn without any gun. NOT EVEN A KNIFE. They have to jump over explosive barrels that have a detonator that will detonate them in 20 sec. If they survive they will enter a few corridors. Each corridor sets in to flames every 3rd sec so you have to be fast. And its some breakable floors to that you can get traped in and burn to death.\r\nAfter the corridors you have to be first up to a wagon that contaions one and only one ak47. The guy who gets it will be able to shoot everybody else to death and if he dont the whole map will be set into flames in 20 sec and everyone will die.\r\n\r\nIt's really funny. I didnt thought that it was that fun untill i played it. I laghed all the time. Its perfect to play with your mates or have on your server.\r\n\r\nI think we are the first who does this kind of map so therefore its no other category then DEATHRUN to post this in and im sorry for that.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to use NOBLOCK when your playing this. Otherwise you wont be able to take the lead when you at last. And if you dont use noblock you might be blocked and die.!!\r\n\r\nvisit our webpage at http://www.zfh.cs.nu"

Their only weapons are knives and buttons, which correspond to traps outside the building.\r\n\r\nObjective: TERRORISTS - The counter-terrorists are out to get you, and your only defense is a series of traps designed to kill anyone and everyone. You will need to work together to the best extent choosing who works what obstacle at what time. If you fail, and a counter terrorist makes it to the top, you will have to scramble and form an alliance to take down the monster with a shotgun using only knives and strategy.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER TERRORISTS - Those pesky terrorists are keeping you from the shotgun at the top of the looming building. You will need to dodge traps using your l33t ninja skills you claim to have. If you prove yourself worthy and an adept runner, you will be granted a shotgun, which you will then use to take down the terrorists. However, make your shots count, because it will be embarrasing if a terrorist lands a blow on you with a knife...\r\n\r\nGameplay: Out of all the death_run remixes, this one is the HARDEST so far, depending on the skills of the terrorists. Don't expect the shotgun to be an easy grab, unless the terrorists are completely clueless. AFK's are not a problem, they will all be killed in at least a minute. The run is TIMED, from the moment a terrorist touches the floor. Here's the timer system overview: after 60 seconds the CT spawn is destroyed (taking afk's with it.) Then, every 5 seconds a stretch of the floor breaks, and the trap on that floor malfunctions and goes out of control.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who helped me along with this map. Also thanks to Icepick for the amazing idea.

If you fail, and a counter terrorist makes it to the top, you will have to scramble and form an alliance to take down the monster with a shotgun using only knives and strategy.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER TERRORISTS - Those pesky terrorists are keeping you from the shotgun at the top of the looming building. You will need to dodge traps using your l33t ninja skills you claim to have. If you prove yourself worthy and an adept runner, you will be granted a shotgun, which you will then use to take down the terrorists. However, make your shots count, because it will be embarrasing if a terrorist lands a blow on you with a knife...\r\n\r\nGameplay: Out of all the death_run remixes, this one is the HARDEST so far, depending on the skills of the terrorists. Don't expect the shotgun to be an easy grab, unless the terrorists are completely clueless. AFK's are not a problem, they will all be killed in at least a minute. The run is TIMED, from the moment a terrorist touches the floor. Here's the timer system overview: after 60 seconds the CT spawn is destroyed (taking afk's with it.) Then, every 5 seconds a stretch of the floor breaks, and the trap on that floor malfunctions and goes out of control.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who helped me along with this map. Also thanks to Icepick for the amazing idea. I hope everyone enjoys this map as much as me and my friends do."
