Basically, there are 4 humans and the rest are zombies. The humans need to hold the zombies off for 150 seconds. Once 90 seconds pass, the humans will be allowed to unlock a bomb shelter door from a button that is inside one of the bedrooms.

Blowing up the front door will kill any zombies near it but will make it a lot easier for the zombies to get in and attack you.\r\n- Humans and zombies can break the wood covering the windows.

Thats why you may have seen it somewhere before. This map as previous one is rather \"easy\" course map with a lot to discover. Over 25 levels to play through and a lot of secrets etc.&nbsp;<br><br>It is really stupid to say this because it's been so long time from previous map upload, but this map features different soundtrack to each \"worlds\", which I learned myself just for this map. But I have to say, there are some missing textures on some levels which makes me and probably you a bit mad, but I can't do anything for that because I made this 3years ago and lost a lot of the material etc. Hope you understand. <i>To mention it is just a couple levels, nothing serious(I hope).</i><br><br>To notify you, this is <i>not the \"original\" map</i>. The \"original\" one is mg_ZeiZeiii_2 which I made first. But because players thought it was a bit too hard I made this easier version. If you would like to play the original harder one, please write a comment and I can upload it here too.<br><br>And what comes to the texture creators, I cannot remember the names anymore, but if you spot your texture on this map you can comment about it and I will add you to credits. All the downloaded textures was downloaded from here, gamebanana, so I'll check the profiles uploads to confirm.<br><br>Thank you all \"veterans\" who liked my maps 4-5 years back, and I hope all the good for you, and for you newer hosts and players, keep the flag of css high!!<br><br>Whooof, after that, I have to say that&nbsp;I am officially being retired from css map making (having being for 3years for now) because life goes on and one grows up, I would love to make content, but becaming adult means less freetime, and on top of that i think css community isn't the same again. It might be because im a lot older now, but thats just how i feel.<br><br>I hope you enjoy this map, it have been a wild ride during those 3000hours of css.<br><br><h1><span class=\"RedColor\">Love you, bye</span></h1><br>PS. I also made mg_ZeiZeiii_Xmas map which is xmas edition of the mg_ZeiZeiii(with completely different levels ofc(and before this map)), so if you doesn't have that yet and would like to, mention it in the comments ;D"
