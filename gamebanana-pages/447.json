A door can be broken to get into the basement, or you can go down one of the two ladders on the main floor (one at the bottom of the tower, one behind the bar).  There is also a secret tunnel, but you'll have to find it yourself.  The ivy on the tower can be climbed to get to the roof, as can the ivy along the eaves above the parlor balcony and the hedge maze.  The only other way to get up to the roof is by the crates at the Terrorist spawn.  The Terrorist team spawns on either side of the building, while the Counter-Terrorists spawn in the small cluster of trees at the bottom of the hill leading to the villa.  No bomb site, no hostages; the only way to win is to defeat the opposing team.  Have fun."

Centered around a long section of highway based on real locations in California mountain ranges, there is plenty here to see.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this map IS NOT INTENDED FOR GAMEPLAY. While I've included spawns and buyzones, the map is not designed for balanced play.

Place the cstrike folder inside youraccount\\Counter-Strike source\\  (overwrite where necessary)\r\n2. Right click the MM Practice shortcut (after extracting to desktop), and go to properties.\r\n3b. In the line \"Target:\" ensure the path to your steam.exe is correct.\r\n3c. In the \"Start in:\" line, ensure the path to your Steam folder is correct, and apply.\r\n** If you would like to change the map the practice shortcut starts, adjust the target line accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b class=\"blue\">--(MM)</b>PLAY\r\nStart the practice by executing the MM Practice shortcut.\r\n\r\nNote: The listenserver.cfg changes your mat_dxlevel to 90.\r\n\r\nIf you normally play CS:S with a different value, do the following:\r\n\r\nAdd the launch options command -dxlevel X to your \"My Games\" CS:S launch options (ex. -dxlevel 81)\r\n\r\nThis will ensure everytime you start up CS, outside of the practice shortcut, you have dxlevel 81.\r\n\r\nAlso note that crosshair scale is adjusted to 1200 for ease of use in listenserver.cfg\r\n\r\n<b class=\"blue\">--(MM)</b>QUESTIONS\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> Is there a 1.6 version of these MM maps?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> Yes, there is, but only Source versions are distributed becuase they are less intensive on the eyes.\r\n   When CSP has a stable release, I'll look to recreate/port the maps for convenience when possible.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> Do I shoot the targets or just aim at them?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> Just aim. Mimicking the shooting process is important however. My advice is to empty the m4a1\r\n   and turn up the in-game sound loud enough for the \"click\" of missing ammo to be heard over mp3s. \r\n   Source crosshairs react as if a gun was fired, even if no bullets are in the clip. This gives the \r\n   effect of shooting, without dealing with messy bullet holes or stuttering recoil delay. I wouldn't\r\n   click for every point, but rather only for a specific ring of colors or two.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> How long does it take to complete each MM map?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> A 20-30 minute program would generally consistent of 250 reps per point on mm_8, \r\n   or 25 reps per point on mm_64 (give or take 15min, depending on the speed).\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> What is a \"rep\" in this situation?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> A rep is full movement from the center point to the specified point, and back again to the center.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> May I decompile the map to change the colors of the points?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> Sure, I don't mind. Just limit it to personal use (as to avoid confusion of proper version). The colors\r\n   are currently not as varied now, because only limited default textures can be seen effectively without\r\n   individual adjustments to lighting (afaik).\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> I've designed a nice logo for the shortcut. How can I contact you about it?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> See the Support section below.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Q:</b> May I host this file?\r\n<b class=\"green\">A:</b> Anyone and everyone is free to host this file, as long as it is free of charge\r\n   and the contents are left unedited and fully intact.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"blue\">--(MM)</b>SUPPORT\r\nAny questions or concerns (technical or otherwise) please direct them to deLiGHT in #drexel on GameSurge."

In \r\nthe box in the middle of the map there is a hidden breakable floor that has my clan logo \r\non it's floor. This is awsome \r\nto hide inside and shoot ppl as they run past.\r\n\r\nRange1:-\r\nRange 1 is a massive rifle range that allows you to practice with each gun available \r\nin the game. When you enter each booth a red light comes on outside above the doorway to \r\nshow there is someone in there. You will be stripped of weapons and you will find 2 buttons - \r\nthe first on the shelf gives you the gun (it has a timer so multiple weapons can be spawned);\r\nthe second (on the wall) moves the target. You press this multiple times to set the distance -\r\nthere are 4 set positions but u can press it while moving at any time to stop it. This range \r\nis excellent for showing the different effect each weapon will have when fired over\r\ndifferent distances. the teleport in has a 2 second delay to help reduce getting stuck.\r\n\r\nRange2:-\r\nWhen you enter this section you will see 4 mini ranges - \r\n\r\nthe first is a nade throwing\r\n exercise and the dummies disaper when you hit them; \r\nthe second is a target range when you hit the bull on the target a box pops down\r\nand there is a spining target than can be set at 3 difficulty levels;\r\nthe third is another type of spinning target with dummies that disappear when you hit them\r\nand again this can be set at 3 different difficulty levels;\r\nthe forth is a moving target, when you hit the dummies they disappear and this again\r\ncan be set at 3 difficulty levels.\r\n\r\nSniper pit:-\r\nThis area is a clone of the pit from dust2 but in a mirror style setup. The distance is the same \r\nas if you were awping to site A when you go in this area you have to get the awp from the \r\ndispenser and take out the enemy CT spawn one side and T the other.\r\n\r\nArea1\r\nThis is a massive area, CT spawn one side and T the other. There is a table with a button to get \r\nyour weapon. The idea is to improve your skills with m4/ak over a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs - \r\n\r\nThe nade area of the map can be seen from a certain point from the main area\r\n"

I touched it up a little more and optimized it a bit, so now it's good for a release. Most of the brushwork is world (not tied to entity) mainly because there's no need for bots, and it's not a competitive gameplay map.\r\nThere is a very good chance that every thing in this map is inaccurate to what a shooting range probably looks like nowadays. This is just what I had envisioned, so that's how it came out.\r\n\r\nSorry about a couple of the custom textures and their mipmaplessness. I tried for like a half hour to get them mipmapped and for some reason they just wouldn't work. \r\n\r\nInstall into your maps folder\r\n\r\nIf you find Chef Ainsley, that means you are a noclippin' fool. jk <3"
