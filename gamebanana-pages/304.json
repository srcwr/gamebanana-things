Then, on the first level, above the water, are 2 moving platforms, which circulate the water, which pass both spawns, and the 2 isolated sniping platforms in 2 corners of the map. The water, is electrified, as showed and warned by env_spark objects and huge signs telling you, that its NOT SAFE TO SWIM IN. You can pass through these signs, and are only viewable from a single direction.\r\n\r\nIn the second level rooms, I added another sniper-hole, that's elevated and that you cannot pass through... \r\n\r\nThe breakable glass tiles, break with a single pistol shot. The reason this is, because I had to copy an existing glass tile and multiply it by like a billion! I have a problem with my sourceSDK, where I cannot make breakable objects...\r\n\r\nAround the water, is/and/are slanted brushes. You cannot walk on these, because, it would be cheating! You can't SKIP the electrified water! So if anyone is wondering, that's why, I made it that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have made 2.5 \"secrets\" on the map. Two secret rooms, and the other is, well, more of a glitch, but its fun! So try and find em. OH! If you do, please keep it to yourself!

		"_sText": "Ms. Pacman was, and still is, a great game.  I decided to turn it into a glass map.  In the first version, I had blocks.  That's it.  Then I rounded all of the blocks.  The biggest problem with this map was the damn textures.  I couldn't get a good combination.  Well, eventually, I did--however, I had received requests to make the map larger, to make the corridors narrower, and to put in breakable glass.  To expand the map, I put a lower level having nothing to do with Ms. Pacman.  (Although the colored lights are the colors of the 4 ghosts in the original arcade version.)  This lower level offered more safety than the top level, and I was able to put a second bombsite.  Then I killed two birds with one stone, making the corridors narrower by putting breakable glass 'padding' around the base walls.\r\n\r\n"

Because of (1) and the fact that an eighth of the map was destroyed in one grenade, I moderately upped the damage you must deal to the glass to break it, and the \"crystals\" are appropriately much stronger than the floors.\r\n(3.) Added some random points to the tops of the wall for a more alien look.\r\n(4.) Changed the skybox (which also changed the color of the floor and crystals) for a more alien look.\r\n(5.) In the beta I neglected to notice I hadn't completely finished the pit. The deeper end is now a hexagon rather than a rectagle\r\n(6.)

From there on I just kept on expanding.  In the end, I had two underground floors, a roof, two very tall spiral staircases, two extra bombsites, and some very interesting textures.  I think that it's a major improvement on the original.  I also see no reason to acknowledge the original glassfun maker because the only thing I 'took' from him was the glass bricks at spawn.
