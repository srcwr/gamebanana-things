I've always liked futuristic environments in the vein of Blade Runner, and for long I've thought to do a map following that kind of style. However, I never decided to do it since I felt I'd ruin it. I still think I have.\r\n\r\nNoir takes place in a not-so-distant future. Fog, dust, rust and trash fill everything. Starting at the depths of the sewage/underground system, players must reach one of the final locations (the map, however, is linear and one of those is opened up by the players' actions). The average length of a round should be 8 minutes and a bit more (which is perhaps a bit too much, I know), and it should be done fastly enough since (as explained in the map's plot in the selection menu) there is an autonuke at 0:15.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- 64 spawnpoints\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- 3DSkybox\r\n- Color correction\r\n- Puzzles\r\n- Holding\r\n- A bit of detail\r\n- Decal overflows because I don't care\r\n- Music (from Vangelis)\r\n- Ambience\r\n\r\nI didn't bother with a radar yet just as I didn't bother with a few other final touches like having map-specific CVars. Those will come as new versions come.\r\n\r\n### Future version\r\n\r\nI plan to add levels where the endings are (in fact one of them is already started) that will then merge into one final, probably hard ending. I am also debating whether I should or should not add special weapons, but that will depend on how the map performs as-is. I believe special weapons wouldn't fit the map probably (and I think they're boring because most of them have ended up being cheap copypaste to bring an 'epic' factor that can't be copied since it is inherent to specific maps). Still, we will see.\r\n\r\nBug reports, as always, are welcome; don't confuse, however, difficulty with bugs and/or glitches. There might be paths left open to make chokepoints harder just as there might be ways to advance further quicker: it is recommended to use them if found so the timer doesn't run up."

That wasn't supposed to be possible, so i added a push.\r\n\r\n - Fixed : Simming possibility in underground sea\r\n\r\nBack with this version 2.4 that improves the gameplay quality and the fun. Here are the changes since version 2.3 : \r\n\r\n - Fixed some little bugs, like the boat stuck, now afk teleports this area too.\r\n - Removed Final Flash weapon, causing a too large and to sudden balance. (+ avoid raging zombies)\r\n - Changed Boats cover, now zombies can't attack from water, they attack from side paths.\r\n - Improved boss fight, now the controller is alone in a room so that other zm don't make him blind + now the boss has a freeze, activable by the controller, and also small eyes are activable, not auto-controlled anymore.\r\n - Added 2 zm weapons : the stopper (like the one in paranoid) and the shocker, that slow near cts.\r\n - Added 2 ct weapons, the heal gun and the berserker (20 sec of invulnerability for the owner, useful to use knife against zm)\r\n - End rules changed, zm have no more 300 HP when they take the portal. Now the keep their health until portal is closed, and have then 1 HP left.\r\n - Added 2 secret Trail cuts\r\n - Added a DJ Room inaccessible with noclip, only if you know the secret teleport (room for me and Zip)\r\n\r\nThat's all for a version 2, next one will be version 3 with levels, but only if, i hope, i can manage to fix huge bugs with hammer (some burshes count as more than 500 faces and i don't know why, so i'm almost to the max_numplanes)\r\n\r\nThanks for playing and leaving feddback :)"

It's been textured, has some actual lighting, a new custom skybox, added decals/overlays, and the gameplay has been changed so that it fits the title of Zombie Escape. The map has been fully tested for any bugs and since there are simply none to be found, it has been released.\r\n\r\nPlayers start off at the spawn, below all the madness. They must work together to break the glass and climb the stairs, or may risk going on their own and climbing the ladders that surround the cliffs. It's a sort of maze-like puzzle and you have choices as to which route you would like to take. Once a player reaches the top, they press a button which will deactivate the flood gates below, flooding the entire complex from top to bottom. When this occurs, it's a race to the top, and in the meantime you must fend off the zombies presumably coming from four directions. The round ends when the water reaches the top and after all zombies and/or humans have been killed.\r\n\r\nThis map truly is a lot of fun and while it didn't take too long to make, it looks very nice and the gameplay is very unique. It's worth giving the map a try on your server and seeing if the players like it. I have a running bet that they will if they're looking for new escape maps.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, as always, comments, assessments, and stamps are more than welcome. Thanks in advance for your comments and enjoy the new map! I hope to see this on some servers soon. =D\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho"

Motanum Inc. This industry is dedicated to producing boats and helicopter. What a coincidence for humans!\r\n\r\n************\r\nHow to play!\r\n************\r\n\r\nNote, you will usually have to press a button to activate certain things (It has a green light, and turns to red when it has been activated. Console will let you know of certain waiting times)\r\n\r\nFirst, simply try to get on the boat hangar, and defend from any zombies. When the time comes get on the boat and get on the wall in the fortress. Humans who failed to get on the boat will be teleported to a place where they are easy target for zombies. Zombie shave then 30 seconds to get on the helicopter.\r\n\r\nThe helicopter will try to overfly above the fortress. If this happens Humans are dead! So you must shoot the helicopter down before its too late! (Note, shoot with your weapons, the more people that shoot at it, the faster it gets shoot down. There is no timer, or any kind of special artillery. YOU MUST DO THE SHOOTING, so organize your teammates to defend and not to stand around being dumb)\r\n\r\nGiven that you shoot down the helicopter, defend the entrance fort entrance as usuall, then when the boxes you are defending break, it means is time to fall back. Simply enter the bunker. Keep shooting, as zombies might try to get you. Press the console in the bunker. Get to the elevator quickly! defend for a small time before the elevator leaves.\r\n\r\nThen find your way to the underground boat. Get on it. And when its time, the boat leaves (Fail humans will be teleported again, so for your own good, don't hide). Shoot off any zombies trying to boat jump! After, enter the hallway. The door will open when you are close to it. But before you enter, be sure to get healed to 100 hp! It's imperative you get healed. After about 10 seconds, zombies will be able to enter the hallway and try to penetrate the small bunker you are defending from.

What a coincidence for humans!\r\n\r\n************\r\nHow to play!\r\n************\r\n\r\nNote, you will usually have to press a button to activate certain things (It has a green light, and turns to red when it has been activated. Console will let you know  of certain waiting times)\r\n\r\nFirst, simply try to get on the boat hangar, and defend from any zombies. When the time comes get on the boat and get on the wall in the fortress. Humans who failed to get on the boat will be teleported to a place where they are easy target for zombies. Zombie shave then 30 seconds to get on the helicopter.\r\n\r\nThe helicopter will try to overfly above the fortress. If this happens Humans are dead! So you must shoot the helicopter down before its too late! (Note, shoot with your weapons, the more people that shoot at it, the faster it gets shoot down. There is no timer, or any kind of special artillery. YOU MUST DO THE SHOOTING, so organize your teammates to defend and not to stand around being dumb)\r\n\r\nGiven that you shoot down the helicopter, defend the entrance fort entrance as usuall, then when the boxes you are defending break, it means is time to fall back. Simply enter the bunker. Keep shooting, as zombies might try to get you. Press the console in the bunker. Get to the elevator quickly! defend for a small time before the elevator leaves.\r\n\r\nThen find your way to the underground boat. Get on it. And when its time, the boat leaves (Fail humans will be teleported again, so for your own good, don't hide). Shoot off any zombies trying to boat jump! After, enter the hallway. The door will open when you are close to it. But before you enter, be sure to get healed to 100 hp! It's imperative you get healed. After about 10 seconds, zombies will be able to  enter the hallway and try to penetrate the small bunker you are defending from. Zombies can get healed back to 2500 (Its fired to a zombie on the healing place every second. Note that if you have over 2500 hp, you will be brought down to 2500 hp)\r\n\r\nOnce the doors close, simply go to the vent, and climb as fast as you can! Explosions will be behind you! This is where those 100 hp come handy! get on the chopper and you have survived to escape another day!\r\n\r\n**end**\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n-A destructible helicopter!

1\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThings have been changed since I saw some extraordinary glitches (thats why I didn't choose the winner of the contest), and I changed some things on the map:\r\n\r\n- Added a Player Model relationed to the Game Mirrors Edge, the Girl \"Faith Connors\" (I think its that name);\r\n- Added 1 song to Extreme Mode (Linkin Park - New Divide);\r\n- Added 1 song to God/Impossible Mode (Linkin Park - A Light That Never Comes);\r\n- First Suitcase has been changed (in Hard, Extreme and God Mode, making more hard to stay away from zombies);\r\n- Changed a bit things to the contest (you can see in the map or the link with the image);\r\n- The first Hold Spot has been changed, not so far, for the people who can't climb the boxes);\r\n- Fixed the Bugs and Glitches mentioned by Hasard.\r\n\r\nI hope you can beat this map.\r\n\r\nze mirrors edge reborn v4 2\r\n==================\r\n\r\nSome people know that this map version was released one and half month ago, but I never add in gamebanana.\r\n\r\nFixed things:\r\n\r\n- Fixed the Player Model;\r\n- Fixed many glitches;\r\n- Closed the contest (nobody wins.);\r\n\r\nMaybe a new version comes...\r\n\r\nSome other aspects...\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIf you see any bug in the map, tell me in steam, comment here or send an email to **_hallucinogenictrollmaps@hotmail.com_**.\r\n\r\nYou don't have any permission to edit the map without my permission (Hallucinogenic Troll).\r\n\r\nIf I see an ilegal version, it will be deleted absolutely."

Just follow any of these steps.\r\n\r\n### Option 1\r\nSimplest way is pressing 'Disable skins' button in Admin room. Once you press it it will disable until the map is changed. You will have to do it every time the map is played though.\r\n\r\n### Option 2\r\nYou can use my [config](https://db.tt/yZrfNEV8) that will automatically do it. You have to put it in your server into **cstrike\\cfg**. Works every time.\r\n\r\n### Option 3\r\nMake sure to execute command **minecraft_noskins** using your own config that gets executed with the map."

Both paths converge at the minecart hub. The cave path contains a short minecart path. There are three minecarts at the hub and each lead to the same place. Pull the levers and get ready for one wild ride! The buttons on the minecart are for the horn , cant get enough of that :P. The rocks on the ceiling can be shot down to crush people and the minecarts will push them out of the way so dont worry if its in your tracks. The mine carts eventually crash and you have to take the rest in foot till you reach the elavator. The \"Engineer \"there will get the generator running and then tell you to test out his little zday plan. Thank god someone was prepared :P.
