The government sent all their toxic chemicals to this underground facility in Mexico, in order to cease the radiation. What the government didn't know, is that the scientists were developing a virus, which would harm the whole world. After testing the virus on pigs, something odd happened. The pigs suddenly rose from the dead, mutating into horrible beasts, which broke through the security gates and slayed all the scientists. No contact with the US army has ever been made since then...\r\n\r\nThe police forces were sent to the toxic facility, which now has been shut down for a couple of years. As the police forces arrive, they sence how the air smells rotten and that the atmosphere is doubtful. After a long walk back in to the facility, they finally spot the source of the virus outbreak. The mutated pigs had already escaped, but there was one more left, which was the mother of them all. When one of the police tries to put it down, it strikes back and infects him. This was of course not seen by anybody else than the infected, who also tries to hide it. As they have fulfilled their task and progress to the exit, the infected suddenly mutates into a flesh seeking beast, which has no other goal than eating meat...\r\n*************************\r\nMAP INFORMATION:\r\n*************************\r\nThe map has two spawns, which avoids everybody from getting infected at once. You start down at the first floor, and have to progress upstairs. There are 4 ways to the second floor, either by opening the gate or by using a vent shaft. There you can either run past the toxic waste machines, or take the old elevator, which still is the fastest way. At the final point of the second floor, you have to defend the elevator for 30 seconds. At the final third floor, you'll have to reach the final escape zone, where you will have to call for a rescue vehicle, and wait until it arrives. Goodluck soldier...\r\n\r\nThere are also 2 secret weapons which were developed by the scientists and are still hidden somewhere in the facility.\r\n\r\nTeamplay, experience and survival skills are REQUIRED in order to survive. Luck also has a big matter!\r\n\r\n*64 player spawns, 32 T and 32 CT\r\n**At the third floor, when the junk smashers are activated, zombies can disable these by pressing the button in the hidden lab next to it.\r\n***Custom ending music + custom made nuke"

You have a fair amount of time to escape to the exit of the facility, before the laboratory self destructs.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/VgslQAUDHSM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/VgslQAUDHSM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n=======\r\nMany thanks to eric, reacz, TopHATTwaffle, Antony, MaiK\\_ and AmstaFF for the awesome custom textures.\r\n\r\nCredits to VALVe as well.

It fixes texture issues occuring after a CS:S update, as well as extends the map slightly, as well as fixes several other issues.\r\n\r\n- Now Mani Admin Plugin is not required to display game messages, although ma_csay is used at the end of the map to make it more exciting.\r\n- Fixed texture glitches\r\n- Starting doors now have buttons beside each of them (don't need to run to press the one in the middle anymore)\r\n- Fixed orange crates breaking from grenades\r\n- Humans now hold the conference room using an iron curtain style defense (no more white table on its side). A line of metal racks now form the \"entrance\" into the room.\r\n- The fence beside the Heaven Portal room will now be open until a zombie comes nearby it. The wall beside the fence has been changed to glass.\r\n- Almost all gates when closed due to zombies being nearby them, will re-open faster.\r\n- Entrance to the Laboratory is no longer a small hole formed by wooden boxes. Instead, it is also an iron curtain now.\r\n- A ladder will appear after humans passed the Panel Walk, so zombies do not need to take the small and narrow stairs anymore.\r\n- The glass just before the zombie will break when humans pass a certain point. (The metal \"steps\" as well will break).\r\n- The fans before the elevator now push zombies back at a lower strength.\r\n- There are now ladders in the Cable Car room (the massive metal room with the cable car) on the other platform (side), so zombies do not need to balance their way across anymore. If they still wish to, the bars above the cable car have been multiplied that it is no longer narrow.\r\n- A new epic music track from Portal 2 has been added. When the self-destruct button is pressed, either the new track or the old one will be randomly played.\r\n- The escape sequence portion of the map has been slightly extended. You have to run more carefully and faster now as time is a lot tighter\r\n- The narrow \"tube\" beneath the credits signboard has been blocked (it was impossible to get humans underneath it).\r\n- Cake has been added. Get it if you really want to.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n========\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Hints / Areaportals (Optimization)\r\n- LDR\r\n- Supports 64 players\r\n- Around 7 minutes of roundtime\r\n- Original idea obstacles\r\n- Exciting musics\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND GAMEPLAY\r\n=========================\r\nThis map is a prelude to ze\\_FireWaLL\\_laboratory\\_part2\\_2\r\n(http://www.gamebanana.com/csszm/maps/164711)\r\n\r\nIn this prelude, you escape from the interiors of the laboratory, thus it will be an entirely indoors map.\r\n\r\nThe map is designed to be unique. Unlike other escape maps of just running to the end and pressing a button to nuke the zombies, this map consists of 3 portions.\r\n\r\nThe first part is mainly camping and holding back zombies while waiting for doors to open.\r\nThe second part comprises of running all the time through the test laboratories.\r\nThe final part is the nuke. Unlike other escape maps, in this map, you need to run to a safe spot after you press the nuke. You have a fair amount of time to escape to the exit of the facility, before the laboratory self destructs."

The system is not perfect, but helps discouraging Materia Griefers and makes them easier to spot for admins who can punish them accordingly.\r\n- Fixed a bug that was causing lots of rounds to have only Ultima and Earth Materia on them.\r\n- Sighly increased Bahamuth HP per player.\r\n- Ultima can no longer be used by Zombies when its still on his spawning spot.\r\n- Reduced 1 minute the duration of the ZM rounds.\r\n- Fixed a glitch that allowed people to go on top of the Pub on the City Area.\r\n- Dodging Sephiroth's last attack on Extreme now grants 100 aditional points to all who make it.\r\n- Sighly changed Gravity mechanics, now it doesn't completly freeze the zombies within; on the game gives the same result.\r\n- One un-used door was removed; the secondary door on the first hold position is now deeper in the wall to prevent getting teleported inside to people that prefer to take that door.\r\n- Fixed minor bugs; like removing the cornise near Sephiroth's corridor.\r\n- Prevented unwanted-teleport-spam for zombies falling on some blind spots on the top of the trains, at the begging of the round.\r\n- Now there is no door for the Button's Room on Extreme; some people keep trying to go there and believed the locked door to have juts bugged. You can't use buttons on Extreme.\r\n- Removed the door on the Big Room that leaded to the Vent Way; it was always open by the time someone reached it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(VERSION 1_4 IS BUGGED, VICTORY WILL NOT COUNT, V1_4_1 COMING)<br>\r\nDEMOS WILL BE COMPARED FOR THE FIRSTS DAYS (UNTIL 17-10-2010)\r\n\r\n----- MAP NEW UPDATES ------<br>\r\n- All bugs of v1_4_1 fixed.\r\n\r\n- Contest!

Heal magic will be more decisive.\r\n<li> Zombies have 50.000 of HP in extreme mode.\r\n<li> In hard and extreme mode: +0.75 seconds to Sephiroth, +1.5 seconds to the bridge. \r\n\r\n\r\nFFVII MAKO REACTOR MAP\r\n\r\nMade by Hannibal[SPA] (Rafuron)<br>\r\nOpinions/Ideas Maese Danielot\r\n\r\nTested by ZES, GeClan, SupremeElite, FRAGXL, Hellz and InfinitiveGear community.\r\n\r\n---- MAP SPECIAL FEATURES<br>\r\n6 MAGICS<br>\r\n::Ice (upgradeable) -> freezes an enemy -> + freezes all enemies in a row -> ++ freezes all enemies around you.<br>\r\n::Fire (upgradeable) -> burn an enemy -> + a fire wall that hurts and burn -> ++ a big area that hurts and burn.<br>\r\n::Wind (upgradeable) -> slow zombies in a row -> + push away zombies in a row -> ++ push zombies near you (360º protection)<br>\r\n::Earth -> spawns a wall (during 5 seconds)<br>\r\n::Heal -> heal near humans<br>\r\n::Ultima -> kills near zombies (casting takes 20 seconds)\r\n\r\n4 DIFFICULTY MODES (everytime you beat a mode, you go to the next difficulty mode)<br>\r\n::EASY<br>\r\n::MEDIUM<br>\r\n::HARD<br>\r\n::EXTREME\r\n\r\n3 DIFFERENT FINAL BOSSES\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT WAYS\r\n\r\nCUSTOM MODELS/SOUNDS/COLOR CORRECTION/TEXTURES\r\n\r\nNPC SHOWS YOUR WAY\r\n\r\nMap based on Final Fantasy VII, the first stage of the game, where Cloud must put a bomb and escape.

They never interfered with each other and kept peace for years. One day, the aliens decided to build a huge machine called The Eye which would function as a teleporter between the island and their homeworld. When the aliens did their first test with this teleporter all the humans and aliens of the island were killed during the process. Instead of The Eye being a teleporter, a technical mistake was made by the aliens which made this device turned out to be a doomsday device killing every living creature on the island.\r\nYears later, new humans arrived and colonized the island. A pact among humans was made not to enter the former alien living zone because of the danger which could be caused by The Eye. A gate was placed in front of the working mine and any trespassenger would be punished by death. These rules were made because The Eye must never see again. \r\n\r\nPresent Day\r\nYou are an inhabitant of the island and you work at the navy warehouse together with your teammates.A deadly virus was shipped in by a foreign boat which turns your teammates into bloodlusting zombies! You see no other option but to run back to the valley and destroy the gate that is blocking the mine which will gain acces to The Eye. You are the only one who can activate The Eye and who can save your town! But the fearsome zombies are not your only danger. Even though the alien race is long gone, their defence system which contains turrets and traps are still active. The humans assumed this information because those who once trespassed the gate and tried reaching The Eye have never returned home.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Note\r\nThis is supposed to be my comeback map after I took a break 8 months ago. This map is a hybrid of different ideas I had back then. So I hope the different elements make it a kickass map to play. I am very satisfied with the outcome anyway. \r\nAbout the map: It took me around 5 weeks to complete. It's a rather heavy map to play. So people with low-end PC's might have some struggling playing it. I am very sorry about this, I tried a lot of optimisation and did my best for those with low-end PC's.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nPrimary maptesters: Krassell, Mononoke, Masen (Thanks a lot guys!!)\r\nSecondary maptesters: i3D forum - JohhnyB, Chimera, PimpJuice, Frauenarzt, Kale Aap, Advaldo, 5unz, JobForACowBow, Westsid3r, Eastsider, WhiteTiger, Kraven, Exodus, Glad All Over, Skael, Hi'nk.  \r\nCustom textures by: Disturbed, Nubblecakes\r\n\r\nHave fun playing it! \r\n\r\n- GARGANTUA\r\n"

As of right now, I do believe it is the best escape map I've made, but the detail does need some work. It just came out of beta after fixing most of the bugs with the map, but the gameplay is good as humans appear to win 45-50% of the time.\r\n\r\nV2 will most likely be released early next month (February 2008), and this version was a prerequisite to this for me.
