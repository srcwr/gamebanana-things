Since some guy made <br>surf_buzzkill2 (thanks -.-)<br>the original one became unknown.<br>I hope that we may celebrate its<br>revival one day...<br><br>Description:<br><br>For those who did play surf_buzzkill2 but not the original one:<br><br>This map is pretty similar to its second \"version\" except that it's way smaller. The size is about a quarter of bk2 and the speed boosts are much lower to fit the size. There is no mainrail between the two big ramps, which makes it a little bit harder to get that ridiculous speed like in bk2.<br><br>For those who did neither play buzzkill nor buzzkill2:<br><br>This map is a kind of surf-fight-yard. It's pretty small but easy to surf. You can obtain an M3, Kevlar + Helmet and a Night Hawk at spawn (black boxes, picture 2). There are several other weapons like a Magnum Sniper Rifle, a Scout, Dual Elites, M4 and much more. If you can't find your weapon of choice, you can buy it from the hidden secret buyzone. There is also a bomb spot if your opponent likes to camp and you don't know where he is. <br><br>My recommendations for server admins:<br><br>- surf settings (duh...) sv_airaccelerate between 150 and 300<br>- bhop settings (I don't know how they are since the 2010 update)<br>- noblock<br>- NO Deathmatch! No, really, it just doesn't feel right at buzzkill (just like RPG or WCS) ..."

Once 3 bucks spawn hit the GAJ button to open.\r\n- You can walk through each vmf picture and either find a weapon or be teleported to a specific secret area (some are based on the map of the vmf).\r\n\r\n- I am aware that there can be low fps surfing down the side ramps before the m4-ak platform. It should not drop below 30. This is the only place where fps could be a problem.\r\n\r\n- There should be no bugs, errors, nothing.

No more spawn lag.\r\n-You now spawn with a deagle added to the original grenade.\r\n-Previously, the smgs and ak/m4 were too easy to get to, and awps were too hard. SMG's are in the same area, M4/AK were moved more down, harder to get to, and you can now get to outside jail from the M4/AK area.\r\n-Added a new area to jail, top of jail, which you can shoot in, but players cannot see out. This area is only reachable by the hardest surf, whereas in the previous release, the hardest surf was the only way to get to outside jail.\r\n-Lit the map properly - it is not much lighter, and much nicer as well.\r\n-Fixed certain ramp errors.\r\n-Stretched out the ramps a bit, made them less steeper. This should prevent the mass blocking.\r\n-That's about it. Pretty much just optimized it and made it much more fun.\r\n\r\nComments, questions, suggestions, complaints can be directed to:\r\n\r\nAIM: Assaulted Combat\r\nxfire: assaultedcombat\r\n\r\nThanks, and I hope you enjoy.\r\n-AC."

A <b>DM</b> version is in production, but I've been sick, and I wanted to get this out first. DM version will get rid of the button-activated weapon spawners and would get rid of the 3 minute 30 second timelimit where everyone is sent to jail to knife. It would also give the saucers unlimited healh. That won't take long but I just dont have the time or energy quite yet. I would project that this will be done at latest by <b>February 1st ('09)</b>. It will be included in the download file with the name surf_bluetowersDM_v2f. Thanks for your patience.\r\n\r\nYou <b>spawn</b> with the choice of shotgun or scout as your weapon- although others are available throughout the map. Press a button and get your gun. This helps prevent the mass-exodus of people from spawn. There is one blue-smoke m3 shotgun at ct side and red-smoke m3 shotgun at t side- to serve as sort of representatives for the teams. A glass barrier stands between the two sides of the first ramp that breaks after 30 seconds, as well as a glass barrier at the bottom of spawn that breaks after that time, too, to <b>prevent spawnkilling</b>.\r\n\r\nThe map has a <b>circular flow</b> around a main tower and arrows direct you in the right direction. If you fall, you're sent into a glass <b>jail</b> (cts on one side ts on another) that can be opened from two separate spots on the map. There are two remote-controlled flying <b>saucers</b> that drop bombs that can be used as weapons by both sides, or you could just run in and knife. The saucers take practice to use them effectively ;-). <b>Gain speed on this map by going around the circle multiple times.</b> There is one AWP at the top, and water pits towards the bottom where everyone can start over with speed (bunnyhops are lots of fun here). Think of this map as a kind of <b>banocanyon type map in basic structure</b>, but its overall feeling can be a lot different. It's a lot of fun to gain speed, and the ramps allow for some <b>creative surfing</b> and some <b>close combat.</b> After 3 minutes 30 seconds everyone is sent to jail to knife; after another 30 seconds if they aren't dead they are sent to death.\r\n\r\n<b>Notes</b>\r\n\r\nThis is my first released map, but don't underestimate it! I put a lot of time into this, and by the time I was originally done with it, I ended up spending ungodly amounts of time redoing nearly the entire thing so everything was as close to perfect as I could make it. I would love to see this on some servers. FPS was an issue, so I ended up deleting some things I thought helped the looks, like my 3d skybox. But I think it's best if everyone can run it smoother.\r\n \r\n<b>Thanks</b>\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who helped with optimization and compiling (plague420)\r\nThanks to the fpsb community for tutorials and support\r\nThanks to fibbs for sending me to fpsb in the first place\r\nThanks to Roosta and Teeth, who I don't think I've ever talked to but I spent forEVER trying to figure out how to make the saucer bombs explode on press and couldn't figure it out until I took a look at one of my favorite maps, surf_the_gloaming. lol.\r\n\r\nDon't be too harsh- This map is a lot of fun. Try it! There's plenty of stuff you'll find that's not mentioned here.\r\n<b>Have fun!</b>\r\n\r\n<b>So sorry for whoever downloaded this right when it came out there was a major error at ct spawn. Just redownload and it will be v2. Thanks.</b>\r\n"
