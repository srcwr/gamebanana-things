The objective of the map is for the terrorists to get inside of the counter-terrorist 'Castle' and kill all of them. The terrorists do so be traveling around the castle on either the walkway or on the T-Train which travels in a square around the castle at 350 pixels a second.  There is one large platform, whith breakable walls around it and a tall sniper tower, for the ct and two smaller platforms for the terrorists. On one of the terrorist's platforms, is a small walkway that extends out when the two 'main' doors gaurding the ct's castle are destroyed. The platforms are floating and if you fall off any of the platforms, you switch teams and wait for the round to end. This map would be excellent for those with the death match mod for CSS. This map, like many of my others, is GREAT for any size lan party, but it is also enjoyable on an online server with many players. Have fun and please let me know what you think. Oh and if you like the idea, please spread the Castle Defenders trend around."
