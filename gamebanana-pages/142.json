The original map was too small, the brushwork wasn't that great and the lighting was inconsistent and irritating. Also bar the two really cheap spots, there were only 3-4 good places for humans to hold up.\r\n\r\nUnlike other remakes of zm_deep_thought that just add on more to the existing problematic level, my version is a from scratch, ground up remake. No existing geometry was used from the old map, so I was free to make the new level how I wanted without the constraints of the old level to hamper the design.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I spent more time than I probably should have was the lighting. The old level had really ugly blotchy lighting that was really inconsistent. Blues with sickly yellows and bright reds really makes for something nasty. In the new map, I used mostly warmer tones of light on the outer areas and cooler tones on the inner areas of the level to divide the indoor and outdoor aspects of the map.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone can enjoy the visual aspects of the map as well as the gameplay. Long hours were spent by myself debugging weird crashing issues, texture issues and more model issues you can shake a stick at."
