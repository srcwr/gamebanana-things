There are no good answers. I've enjoyed surfing for a long time with one of my interests being surfing for tricks in skyworld. I decided to open a server in October and wanted something that would draw players from that group and as with the countless remakes there are countless skyworld servers. At the same time I wondered what exactly a skyworld with smooth ramps would play like and quite reasonably was getting tired of the skybox having played it for two years. Two birds with one stone, problem solved. Necessary? No, but the map has served its purpose well enough and so I am content with it. It's no work of art, no long hours of creative input, and based on merit of the map's qualities alone, not worthy of a great rating. I didn't try to make this anything more than it is, no useless ramps/platforms/etc. Just a simple edit for a simple purpose. \r\n\r\n-The main/awp ramps are now smooth and completely two-way surfable.\r\n-M3 under each water platform.\r\n-M249 under spawn.\r\n-AK/M4 at bottom pool.\r\n-Ammo in all weapons."
