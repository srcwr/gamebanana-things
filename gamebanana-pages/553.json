Where fighters come to play for money while people who bet on and watch the games come to enjoy their blood get shed.\r\n\r\nMap description:\r\n\r\nBF2_CSS_models.bsp was supposed to be my attempt at modeling a few models from Battlefield 2 but instead I ended up designing a Fight-Yrad map for CS:S with the only two(2) models a managed to recreate. The Counter-Terrorists start in a fortified base while the Terrorists start out in the basement(I need to re-render the map in a future version cause currently the BOT's don't know how to leave the basement. So I had to move the T-spawns to the upper outside.)of an old hut.  The map has two(2)sniper spots equipped with a single AWP each. There are varying amounts of cover scattered around the map. Mortar fire is live, lethal and on going. Also there are a few visible mines between both of the force's spawn zones. The viewing stands can be accessed threw the closet in the building facing the CT Spawn zone. You can purchase weapons threw the Buy-menu or pick them up in various places around the map. All side arms are available in both spawn zones as well as an MP5 crate and an M16 in the CT-Spawn and an AK-47 crate in the T-Spawn. Grenades can be picked up from the chest in both the spawn zones as well. \r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nBugs/ Known Issues:\r\n\r\n+The map is missing a few different bits of detail here and there.\r\n+Some of the terrain isn't lined up correctly.\r\n+One mine occasionally blows up when hit by a mortar round(ballistics will not trip the mines!)\r\n+Um...oh the lighting sucks, as always X)\r\n+You have to continuously hold crouch when useing the tunnel that extends from the hut basement to the outpost.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nAcknowladgment's:\r\n\r\nA big thank you to,\r\n\r\nVALVE: for CS:S and the SDK _ Official site: \r\n@http://www.valvesoftware.com/\r\n\r\nGame(Formally FPS)banana: For hosting and sharing all our creations. _ Just in case you forgot how you DL'ed this: @http://www.gamebanana.com/ \r\n\r\n3kliksphilip: For all his great and powerful tutorials. _ A big must if your in need of a ton of great and powerful tutorials:\r\n@http://www.youtube.com/user/3kliksphilip\r\n\r\nAnd to our our fellow Banana peeps who download and rate/commnet all our levels. _ My Gamebanana Profile is: @http://www.gamebanana.com/members/934991"
