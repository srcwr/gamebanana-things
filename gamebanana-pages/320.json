I've got something to say about this map to <b>prevent flaming.</b>\r\nFirstly: The map size is very large! You can NOT play this map without having fastdownload (bz2) activated. Why it is that large? Well I'm only 10 lights below the maximum. I know this, so I don't want to read it in the cons.\r\n\r\nSecondly: This map is dark. Yarly. I know it, you don't need to tell me. I WANT it like this. The darkness is NO POINT OF CRITISM if you rate this map, but the look overall is. Comments like \"this map is too dark for me\" are not wanted here, I'll also write this to the feedback instructions.\r\n\r\nThirdly: This map is created for 66 tick servers. I guess it will run on 100 tick servers fine aswell, but in the beta tests I noticed that under 33 tick some ramps are glitchy. Please do not flame about this!\r\n\r\nFourthly: You should not play this map in an RPG-similar mod, as in the jail you do not have anything more than a knife and a grenade all 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nAlso this is not a rebel resistance rip-off or whatever (w00t).\r\n*************************\r\n\r\n\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\nATTENTION\r\nIf you got lag on this map, please turn of your HDR.\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nThese three points are the reason for a late release. I want you to be fair.\r\n\r\nCredits go out to Pariah and Karatek√§fer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> I did only add two screenshots, because it's hard to take good ones here, as the ramps are the main event. Please watch the youtube video instead!</b>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"350\" height=\"310\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/E4XamigdTY4&hl=de&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/E4XamigdTY4&hl=de&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"350\" height=\"310\"></embed></object>\r\nHave fun with this new design.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/tuts/6762>Link to a tutorial for the surf_pox teleport effects.</a>"

Stage 1 box has\r\n    no buttons. Once the people in box 2 press \r\n    a 1 of the 2 buttons the people in box one\r\n    will either be spared, or dropped to their\r\n    death. This process continues on to box 6.\r\n    Once the process finishes, you are teleported\r\n    to a mini jail where you are given weapons \r\n    depending on the stage you were on.\r\n\r\n  ¬ªWhen you beat the map you are given an XM1014\r\n    (see autoshotty) with infinite ammo, which\r\n    means no reloading. The people who have \"failed\"\r\n    have their speed reduced to 75% of normal\r\n    run/walk speed. You can either kill them with\r\n    the XM1014 or you can kill them with Nuclear\r\n    Sanitation... just make sure you stay behind\r\n    the blast doors or you will be vaporized!\r\n\r\n  ¬ªThe bonus is rather difficult, which is a good\r\n    thing for a number of reasons. Upon completion\r\n    of bonus you are given a knife, when you push\r\n    \"E\" while holding the knife you are brought to\r\n    a room with 6 doors, a door for each stage.\r\n    Once you go to a stage, you can return to the \r\n    room by pushing \"E\" again. Go crazy.\r\n\r\n  ¬ªYou are also given the option to kill yourself\r\n    at anytime with the easy suicide doors in every\r\n    stage.\r\n\r\n  ¬ªDon't let the map discourage you :]\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank: Junior for his crazy hard bonus!\r\nAll the people making extremely hard skill maps, they inspired\r\nme to make this map. It was supposed to be the hardest map ever\r\nbut it turned into something much different. \r\nAnd how could I forget, ChaoZ for his sexy toxic texture, thanks bud!\r\n"

Keep this in mind when assessing please.\r\n\r\nSurf_perforated, commonly known as a map with bugs, ramp glitches and crappy brushwork (no offence Keeka), but to me also a great and challenging map. I could not let this map end up in the trashcan, so here I am releasing this remake. This remake is a complete remake from scratch. Nothing has been copy pasted, the only resemblance is the gameplay, somewhat the texture scheme and the dimensions. Also bear in mind that this might be a tad easier/harder than the original, since it was a hard task correctly mapping the dimensions right. Many parts were off-grid. \r\n\r\nThe goal is, ofcourse, to make it to the end of the 5 stages. The timer is set to 5 minutes. The first to make it to the end, gets to win a nice but simple smash-your-enemies-game. Also there will be a machinegun and a flashbang ready for you.\r\n\r\nIf no-one makes it to the end in time, everybody gets teleported to a knife arena, with obstacles from my gg map goodies (which most of you probably won't know :p). \r\n\r\nThanks to Morning for testing the map, and making a beautiful video demo of it. I really appreciate it my man!\r\n\r\nThat's it, have fun my people!\r\n\r\n<object width=\"300\" height=\"193\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/f-Rm1f7OR4E&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/f-Rm1f7OR4E&amp;hl=nl_NL&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\"></embed></object>"

The Bonus Levels are all different: \r\nthe first is invcluded in the main map (Screen 1-3)\r\nIn the second Bonus i tried to make a new design and the \"Birdcage-Bonus\" was born. The third bonus was originally made for annother map more than a year ago. Now I just put it in this map because the other project was never finished. The forth Bonus Level is just a \"broken\" combination of the Levels 1 and 2 of surf_Sunset2.\r\nI also added a fifth door at the bonus floor which gets open when sunset2 bonus is finished!\r\nthis is just a simple Funjump that is made for all guys who finished the map because it has no jail!\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nYou have to follow all rails with the same light-color of the start point to pass a Level. There is a √É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É¬Ø√Ç¬ø√Ç¬Ω√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬¢√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ω√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ωendplattform√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É¬Ø√Ç¬ø√Ç¬Ω√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬¢√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ω√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬ø√É∆í√Ø¬ø¬Ω√É‚Äö√Ç¬Ω for every Level in the same color like the lights.

And if you can't beat it, don't comment on the stages you couldn't beat.\n\nThere a tons of secrets in the map, some are grenades stashed around. One secret bonus, and one bonus is available from spawn.\n\nJail version is coming, if there are any issues just report them to me through steam, ss or gamebanana.\n\nThanks a lot to Tilt and Junior for both the awesome bonuses!\n\nThanks to all of those who beta tested it for me!!\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan S for helping me with some ramp issues!\n\nI appreciate it!\n\nINFO:\n\n5 stages, 2 bonuses\nNo timer\nNo Jail\nDifficulty 1-7 = 4,5 \nLightmapscale: 48, 128 on less visible faces.\nMax percentages used: 67,8% brushsides.\nTime spent: 2 months."
