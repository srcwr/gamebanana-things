I strongly recommend you look at how we set it up.\r\n\r\nFeedback is also welcome on this, as I'm trying to get everything tied up for the final release.\r\n\r\n==RELEASE NOTES==\r\n\r\nOct 28, 2009\r\n============\r\nBeta 4 Release\r\n- Increased lighting in cell block by 4x\r\n- Added some props and pictures to infirmary\r\n- Modified several teleport destinations\r\n- Modified solitary doors to always stay open once opened\r\n- Fixed T-Buyzone in solitary cell (should work every round now)\r\n\r\nA few of the less-known Secrets\r\n===============================\r\nOne of the posts in infirmary will turn the entrance of the infirmary into a teleport to the basement.  There is a two second timer on this teleport.\r\n\r\nThe second step from the top on the left-most diving board will open up a teleport above the first bench on the left.  You must use the diving board to access it.\r\n\r\nAll of the secrets in version 6 can be found in this version.  The pistols are in the same locations, including the hidden pistol behind the big cage.\r\n\r\nThere is a door to the top of cells from soccer.  The only way to get there is to side strafe off of the soccer wall where the opening into the soccer field is.  There is an invisible platform and a door.\r\n\r\nThere is a way into the awp spot from kitchen.  On the upper left corner of the metal door to kitchen (on the inside), there is a button that will open up the grate, as well as create an invisible ledge that will help you up.\r\n\r\nIn armory, you can throw a nade into the gun room, to activate the 7 hidden teleports.  These teleports can be used by CT's to access several different parts of the map.  Keep in mind that there is a two second timer on the button, so you have to move quick, or work with other CT's to utilize this feature.  CT's who learn to use this feature, will gain a HUGE advantage over the terrorists."

I guess it's good for a map :)\r\n- Dodge : You have to dodge some plane, which are coming in front of you. Plus there is a little \"laser\" on the floor to make the game harder.\r\n\r\n- The Race : It's not a bhop, it's a long race, winners are teleported. Be carefull, players can climb on the CT zone.\r\n\r\n- The swimming pool : Here you can do loooot of race, mainly with the slide ;)\r\n- Disco with 4 songs\r\n\r\n- Bomb / freestyle : The area in the swimming pool where you can climb on everywall.\r\n\r\n- The site : It's a climb / race.\r\n\r\n- Right/left : You press the button, and Ts have to run to the right side. Cts have to kill the last T.\r\n\r\n- Hunger Game : Simple area with teamkilling :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSecrets\r\n==================\r\nIn this map there are looooot of secret and special weapons.\r\nThe main part of them come from an other map, but the creator don't want to be credited, but thank you anyway :].\r\nThere are lot of \"sounds\" with theses weapons, unfortunatly, they are in french, and i will try to translate them asap.\r\n\r\nYou will find :\r\n\r\n- The Holy bible\r\n- The BIG GUN\r\n- The Car\r\n- The penis\r\n- The lemon gang (Yeah like in ze_paper..)\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun :)"
