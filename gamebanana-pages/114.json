Humans can now enter the bunker, or try to maintain the barricade in the building.</li><li class=\"SelectedElement\"><b>Final Defend:</b>&nbsp;Humans protect the bunker by defending and preventing zombies from<b> touching</b> or <b>passing through </b>the hazard mark. If they fail, the bunker will kill any humans/zombies in the bunker's safe zone. This is intentional, since I want to prevent zombies hiding in the bunker to avoid map nuke.<br></li></ul><br><b>Bunker 1</b><br><img src=\"//drive.google.com/uc?id=1fZgGvskT1tjV-zn-cS-A-skiRenYFP9t\"><br><br><b>Bunker 2</b><img src=\"//drive.google.com/uc?id=10fs_pDGYkFgv3kZXpD-FcPF0lFcfIqqn\"><br>&nbsp;I do have to add that the <b>\"Safe Zone\"</b>&nbsp;part of the bunker that's protected from the map nuke is only the rooms with metal floor.<br><br>This bunker is only an ALTERNATIVE choice for humans to survive, and the MAIN choice would be reaching the end through the helicopter.<br><br><img src=\"//drive.google.com/uc?id=1MvdZ0JAg5y8Q4ngUF31z37EWusjUjVhU\"><br><br>I've made a diagram that consists of in-game events, that hopefully will be a better form of explanation rather than me typing walls of texts:<br><img src=\"//drive.google.com/uc?id=1EZ-prn_60tuFIUDWJrEkBHPE3bMg--Dm\"><br><br>I've added a computer desk in the final zone with light indicator that turns green when there are no zombies in the 2nd helicopter. Otherwise, it turns red.<br><br>I hope these explanations are clear, and it has good gameplay in an actual round. <u>If the image is too small, please right click and open in new tab.</u>",

The reason why will be clear once you read the third point.</li><li>Bunker hatch opens only if humans <b>safely</b>&nbsp;reach the end of the map. If <b>no humans </b>reach the end of the map, the hatch<b> won't</b> open.</li><li class=\"SelectedElement\"><i>(Please look at the second to last screenshot with the caption: Bunker Entrance</i>&nbsp;<i>for visualization)</i>&nbsp;In a situation where some humans <b>safely reach the end of the map</b>, the bunker hatch <b>opens</b>. However, if one or more zombies crosses the hazard mark, the hatch <b>instantly closes</b>. If this happens, <b>zombies</b>&nbsp;should NOT be able to enter the bunker. If zombies do manage to get into the bunker, the nuke also damages zombie hiding in the bunker (not humans). The gameplay goal is humans can defend / create prop barricade in the building with the bunker. <i>I will probably add more bunkers in the future.</i></li></ul><br>I've tested whether the triggers work, and I think they do.
