What happened is that zombies were on 1 side of the map and the human on the other. The zombies made a push to enter into the human places and ate them :p\r\n\r\n Well that was my little emotional moment :p\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map and for any suggestion/personnal feedback here is my steam username : Meg. Feel free to add me :D\r\n\r\nTook me about 4 days to reach this version.\r\n\r\nMap tested on Elite Hunterz server IP : 85.114.140.30:27045 \r\nYou may get stuck in the displacement, I'll try to fix as many as possible in future releases.

Changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n-Added a brush to kill players who camp the top of the elevator and thereby block it. -\r\n-Added a third entrance to the underground portion of the map-\r\n--Said new entrance is a big stairwell next to T-Spawn.  It was added because when the map had more than 12 players, people would crowd the entrances to the underground (the elevator and the well) which would let the zombies kill most of the humans near the start of the round.  Play testing on a crowded 32-person server with a fast zombie spawn time has shown that the stairwell has equaled that out and made it much more fair for the humans.--\r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy the map.\r\n\r\nFor anyone wishing to play this map before adding it to their server, visit the N00b Unlimited zombie server:\r\n\r\n75.126.43.190:27015\r\n\r\nThe map has been a hit with the admins there and they switch to it quite often.</font>"

It can be found without an elevator <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/503\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n04/27/07\r\nConcerned by comments from people who downloaded it, I took time into working on optimizing the map.  I went over each area and wrote down the average FPS.  Then I did tons of work trying to up the FPS on each area one by one.  The result is a faster map that should be playable by people who are accustomed to more than 20 FPS.  (My comp is seriously so bad that I had forgotten about optimizing because I'm accustomed to lag.)  The map still has some slow spots, but many areas saw major improvements.\r\n\r\nI'd much appreciate it if someone with a faster comp could look over it and tell me if it's doing allright now.\r\n\r\nAlso, the new filename is zm_cabin_v2b.bsp</font>"

		"_sText": "This is my first submission which is a simple large fast-paced map that leans more towards being enjoyable and fun rather than being aesthetically pleasing (yet). \r\n\r\nI made this map using the “tunnel -> area -> tunnel -> area” method instead of having a single huge area. This is to hopefully reduce lag by spreading the players and stopping other areas to be unnecessarily rendered. By “area” I mean each of the three large regions.\r\n\r\nI had in mind to create a similar balanced game flow as seen in ‘zm_cbble’ whereas humans and zombies try to control each of the areas until their objectives are met.\r\n\r\nEach large “camping” spot has 2-3 ways to be reached. The majority of the small “camping” spots has one way to be single-handedly reached. All the spots has an extra way of being reached with clever teamwork. However, there are no spots that can be barricaded to prevent entry.\r\n\r\nThe map is intended for medium/high player count (32-64).\r\n\r\nEach of the three areas has a particular theme; household theme, semi-futuristic/industrial theme and dry/rocky theme.\r\n\r\nThe areas are easier to travel to due to the roads having conveyor entities on top which are set to a value of 100. There are 2 conveyors on the road that travel their opposing direction (right hand to be pushed forward).\r\n\r\nEach of the small \"black/white\" textured brushes in the household themed area are just boosters to reach the opposing spots on the other end. The leaves on the ground which are highlighted with yellow lights is a jump booster to reach the higher concrete platform beside it.\r\n\r\nThere is a teleport (green light) inside the cave (which can be reached via the long tunnel) that lets players end up in the semi-futuristic/industrial themed area in order to infiltrate the opposing players that controls tunnels, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 hidden weapons with effects; 1 tracer trail effect (dual elites), 1 rainbow trail effect (dual elites), 1 crown (brush contraption hovering above head) effect (dual elites), 1 monster costume effect (dual elites) & 1 grenade that makes you 85% invisible upon pickup.\r\n\r\nThis map is also semi-optimized and lag-free (for me atleast), however not yet tested with full player count.\r\n\r\nThere are no lightings or reflections (cubemaps) included (yet).\r\n\r\nAny feedback or constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you."
