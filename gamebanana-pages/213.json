Shooting/exploding each other does nothing, so don't waste your bullets or grenades.\r\n\r\nGo in to the laser in the middle, the map then decides (using a counter system) whether you get teleported randomly to one of the 8 boats, or to the whale section of the start room (the number of spawns (50), means that there will always be a whale for the people teleported there to control).\r\n\r\nWhales: Use left and right to turn, forward and back to tilt, and left click for boost. You can crush the players or land on/knock the sides of the boat to make the boat players fall in the water (which hurts them). The whales have 5000 health each. There are 7 controllable whales.\r\n\r\nBoat players: Stay on your boat and shoot at the whales - though they are invincible for the first 30 seconds of the round or until someone controls them. There are 4 types of boats - a rowboat which can be controlled with the movement keys (ie WASD by default), a fishing boat with nets you can climb up to get back on, a raft which sits low enough that you can usually jump back up, and a basic yacht type of boat, which can also be controlled. There are 2 of each of the boat types. The idea is that your boat is either easy to get back on to, or can be moved out of the way of the whales. The controllable boats are meant to be sort of sluggish, too fast and players might fall off the back and the whales would not be able to keep up with the boats.\r\n\r\nThere is also an 8th whale which is controlled randomly by the map, it can turn left and right and \"jump\" out of the water to tip boats more easily.\r\n\r\nAn afk killer starts after 30 seconds. There are trigger_pushes to stop players, whales and boats from getting stuck against the outsides of the map.\r\n\r\nAfter 2 minutes the glass around the centre island breaks and the boat players have 30 seconds to make it to the island and push the button in order to win\r\n\r\n- Possible round endings -\r\n - All of the boat players die, and the whales win\r\n - The 8 whales are all destroyed, and the boat players win\r\n - The button on the middle island is pushed, and the boat players win\r\n - The boat players take longer than 2:30 and are killed, and the whales win\r\n\r\nAs the 'teams' in this map are the whales and the boat players, the winning 'team' is killed shortly after winning so the next round can start.\r\n\r\nI don't intend to add any more whales or boats to the map unless it's too unbalanced for one team.\r\n\r\nMade over about a month, meaning it's not as large as project as any of my other maps. And the focus was on making an enjoyable map, not so much realism. DO NOT DECOMPILE, any questions about how the map works just ask me the comments below...\r\n\r\nCamera method (see screenshot 4) discovered by charli, without it the map would not be nearly as easy to play for the people controlling the whales ;)"

There are a few secrets, almost all of which are at the spawn.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nUpdates to the original include:\r\n\r\n-A few different songs (ie, less trance than before)\r\n\r\n-The \"Boats\" racing minigame has been removed. Having 2 camera screens meant the server could only update one at a time, so the projections were too laggy.\r\n\r\n-The \"Boats\" racing minigame has been replaced by a new minigame, \"Chase\", where one team must try and survive for 90 seconds (without weapons), and the other teams has to try and work together to knife them.\r\n\r\n-Everything has generally been made \"more obvious\" to the players, but the major changes include: arrows showing where to go for the \"Hard\" race, a sign for the jail in \"Escape\", arrows and some easier to reach guns in \"Flying\" (the one with the smoke and the wings), semi-transparent red glass on the \"Future City\" level (the glass shows you where you can climb up, the texture is a ladder), the entire levels of \"Points\" and \"Arena\" have both been redone, players should now have less trouble finding out where to go or what to do, the time spent in the spawn room has been increased, so players have longer to read the hints for the selected race (if applicable).\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\nCTF is sort of laggy, but the entity method I used stops people delaying, as well as letting them see clearly what to do.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that might arise with a lot of players is the map thinking someone has a CTF flag when they actually don't have one attached to them (this is due to the delay in touching the trigger and picking up the smoke grenade with the parented flag). Despite not having a flag, they will still be able to score and win the round.\r\n\r\nThe final issue is that the music quality is lower than what I would have liked. I would have preferred to have better quality music instead, but when I uploaded the original, some users complained about the file size.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nMusic credits are in-game, shown as HUD hints on the right-hand side of the screen.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nDo not post this map on other sites and claim it as your own, do not upload it on other map-making sites, if you want to know how part of the map was made, please post here and I will answer within a few days.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI finished making this about 2 weeks ago (ie, before Hammer was temporarily killed by Valve), but I haven't had time to upload it until now. Please rate and comment :)\r\n\r\nAlso, mg-hn-whaledefencev2 has already been released (the link is on my gamebanana profile). Instead of a dedicated upload, I just edited the original submission, so not many people knew about the change.\r\n\r\nAnd if you add this to your server, can you please give me a heads up? Something in the comments, a post on my gamebanana profile, or a PM, anything's fine :)"

They return with bad news - underground live a hostile community that are now attempting to keep the ring for themselves. With her husband returning from his business trip in only a few hours, the desperate scientist does the obvious - she hires an SAS team to shrink down and take back the ring - by force.\r\n\r\n**T attacking, CT defending:** A large community of tiny people have made their homes in a now-abandoned section of the Handsomeville sewer network. With few possessions from the surface, they place enormous significance on these items, and are willing to protect them with their lives. Recently, intel has discovered that a locally-based terrorist network has gained access to a shrinking machine, and that they are intending to loot the community of its most prized treasure - the golden ring, located in the heart of the town.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nAfter preparing themselves for battle, both sides make use of the sewer's pipe system and enter the town from above, expecting nothing less than a fight to the very end.\r\n\r\nThe round ends when either team has all players killed, after 4 minutes have passed (which kills the attackers), or when the attacking team gets close enough to the ring, which is located in the building with the green light above it.\r\n\r\n~~~ v1b1 Release ~~~\r\n====================\r\n- First release of map\r\n- Released early to allow others to search for gameplay issues\r\n- Notable absences: No spawn/afk killer\r\n- There is no time limit for the attackers\r\n- The map has hardly been optimised\r\n- The lighting has not been done properly\r\n- Most textures are not properly aligned\r\n- Very few buildings are complete, and many are lacking the appropriate detail\r\n- The bathrooms aren't finished\r\n- The starting camera is not where I would like it to be\r\n\r\n~~~ v1b2 Release ~~~\r\n====================\r\n- Competition version\r\n- Very little optimising, only done with lightmap levels atm\r\n- Lighting is there, but it could be better\r\n- 2 secrets\r\n- 2 semi-secrets (which have some influence on gameplay)\r\n- Spawn killers and a timelimit of 4 minutes for the attacking team\r\n- Music may be included in a future version, but more secrets definitely will be\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n==================\r\nPlease understand that this map is not entirely finished. As it was my first entry into a gamebanana competition, I made the mistake of trying to complete a massive map in a relatively short amount of time, so most details are missing. I will try and make an optimised, completed version when I have the time."

I chose not to add sprites to help with lighting because I figured it wouldn't make much difference, and the focus is on the map's gameplay anyway.\r\n\r\nThe overall round timelimit has remained the same though, it is meant to be challenging to finish. As stated before, the time for the first 20 obstacles is more than enough for several attempts per player per round, though to finish the map, a player needs a near flawless run :)\r\n\r\nPlease do not decompile, if you want to know how I made an obstacle I will explain it in the comments for you :)\r\n - I made a new submission so the ratings and comments wouldn't be skewed how they were even with the changes..."

Basically, one team is chosen to defend the a tower, while the other team is trying to attack it. The team defending the tower has a scout and 100hp. The team attacking the tower has a choice of 200hp or a USP.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 minute, an afk killer will activate and after 3 minutes the team defending the tower will be allowed to leave the tower. \r\n\r\nThere are about 10 guns scattered around the map on different buildings (all pistols and 1 AWP). And many smoke grenades all over the place.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid on how the gameplay will be, but if the teams are too uneven, then I will simply make a v2."
