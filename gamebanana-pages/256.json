Now I tried my best again and made maybe not the best, but surely a great map that i can be proud of. Shutdown2 is a sequel to the first shutdown - same concept of flybhop/surf combined map with intentional skips and simple strafe elements that is fun and more or less easy on both auto and scroll, yet very hard to run.<br><br>This map tells you a story about how an idea is born in a creator's mind and what the creator has to face throughout developing his idea. As a contradiction to the first shutdown, it is set in a world that is being developed from scratch. <br><br>Gameplay-wise, I have tried to improve wherever i could to make the map more fun to run and play casually. It has a lot of surfs and spins so I should probably say sorry to people with low sens, haha.<br><br>I used a lot of assets in this map - comment for credit if i forgot you.<br><br>Music: <br><br><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sodxwxter/bhop_shutdown2\">https://soundcloud.com/sodxwxter/bhop_shutdown2</a><br><b>??????</b><br>https://soundcloud.com/uplotnenie/twilight-5<br><br><i>Mapping is just a waste of time, quite interesting tho.</i><br>"

Best part, honestly.<br><br>Known issues:&nbsp;<br>Due to the way i made soundscapes, on big servers, although it is very unlikely, player that chooses not to play music still can start hearing it if another player flagged as music_on enters a trigger at the same time.<br>There is also some weird issues about momentum mod not letting you on the map if you place the start zone.
