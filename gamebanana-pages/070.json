Now, gg\\_Humiliation\\_danger brings an exciting experience of tower defense and humiliation dangers. There are three towers, two for each team and a central one. This central tower has invisible walls when seen from the outside, but it has concrete walls when in the inside. This makes it very vunerable to all other players in the ground, except this tower has healing powers...\r\n\r\nThere is a good camping place, at the players spawn, that offers quite good view to the enemies tower, which could be used by snipers to kill and clean the tower from the distance and the safety of the spawn area. To cross to the other side of the map we have three options, the central passage or the side passages. The central passage is tight and will be full of players trying to get into the main tower, and it’s a big risk going by this path, but neither the side paths will save you from the eminent danger of the humiliation. This sides offer quite good camping spots, either to humiliate players, either to kill players in the towers. It has an simple disposal of obstacles that makes the humiliation task pretty much easy. So, it would be a good way to have fun, looking for killing people that way!\r\n\r\nIn the overall, the map is quite balanced, has good camping spots, good humiliation spots, good sniping spots, offers a competition towards conquering the central tower. Personally, I think the map is great, much better than my first map. So, I expect everyone enjoys it!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[NEW VERSION - CLICK HERE!](http://gamebanana.com/cssgg/maps/165491 \"New version - CLICK HERE!\")"

Its been tested on my gungame server, and appears to be enjoyed by the players. Best for fewer players, but can support up to 16 players. Very small so it makes for an instant action gungame: round start, BOOM ! Headshot! etc, round end. However, there are underground tunnels for hiding and sneaking to enemy spawn to get your knife kill, and an upper area to snipe, so those with lesser guns can avoid immediate action if desired. Makes for a fun kill fest! Download it and let me know what you think, especially what I could do to improve it! Also, please feel free to visit my gungame server: [DE] (Death Elite Squad) REVERSE GUNGAME TURBO SERVER at 72.249.94.124:27015\r\n\r\nTest notes: After seeing the map in action, and with feedback from various sources, I think this map would benefit from the following: Lighting could be improved in the lower area, and I was thinking there should be light switchs at both ends of the tunnels below the floor. Some players like to camp the tunnels forcing players to seek them out in total darkness. Flip a light on, and they lose the darkness advantage. Map could be slightly bigger, with a bit more cover or escape from instant encounters on spawn. The textures should be different, but i'm thinking something less typical than the \"real life simulation\" style texture. I'll let everyone's imagination flow on what I mean by that, because i'm not quite sure how to explain it. "
