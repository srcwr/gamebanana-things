You go outside, and it is nice and bright and there is a crisp layer of snow on the ground!\r\n\r\nWell, this map has the same bright \"day after the storm\" feel to it.\r\n\r\nStart:\r\nFully loaded M3 and Deagle/Grenade\r\n\r\nThere is no jail in this map for I found it to be un-necessary.  There are tele's still lining the ground incase you fall, which will teleport you back to the begining of the stage of surf you fell off of. \r\n(The only place that there is not a teleport is the very begining.  The first ramp is VERY easy to surf, if you fall off, you deserve to die.  End of story.  Also, this helps to prevent spawn killers.) \r\n\r\nFirst stage:\r\nA pretty long section of surf.  After the first main ramp and two turns, you come to a fork, which has a \"Pro\" side and  \"Noob\" side.  The \"Pro\" side is pretty challenging for an intermediate surfer, and the already pro surfers may find it a bit tricky as well.  The \"Noob\" side is a straightfoward surf, nothing hard, but nothing too easy.\r\n\r\nSecond stage:\r\nBased in a small town that has just been snowed in.  The \"Pro\" side of this has a loop, and it is what I would consider to be a difficult surf.  The \"Noob\" side of town is relatively easy, just a bit technical.\r\n\r\nFinal Stage:\r\nThis stage is one of the hardest sections of surf.  There is no \"Pro\" or \"Noob\" side for everyone has to surf it.  It is difficult with many long jumps.  At the end of this, there is a \"leet\" like ending with teleports to both spawns, and the other stages of surf.  Right above this platform is a bombsite.  It is quite hard to get to, but if you are \"Pro\" enough and complete the \"Pro\" section you are taken to a room with 4 M4's and 4 AK's.  It also has 4 Defusal Kits and 4 extra C4's incase the Terrorist with the bomb dies.  This room allows you to return to the begining of the level, bombsite, or the final stage of surf.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this surf is a lot of fun.  There is a lot to it and it should keep people busy for quite a while!\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and happy holidays everyone!\r\n\r\n(Please report any bugs or problems to me here, or my xfire: wowyourgaiy)"

Again, with most of my maps, just look for the 3-1-2 for secret buttons and goodies.\r\n\r\nThe jail itself is one of my finest masterpieces. I littered the ground with leaf decals, placed a few trees, added a rope, and added some shrubbery for those secret sniper spots. At each five minute interval, the jail will become a kill zone, so it's advised not to fall. Yes, the SG550 and the rope is the escape out.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you have fun. \r\n~ Hobbes312"

There, I discovered buildings, surroundings, made by other people. They were abandoned however. I decided to make them public for travellers. It's a complicated thing to do, but not impossible.\r\n\r\nEverybody can visit, however, the visitor must be able to travel by surfing. So only skilled people are able to watch these four special ages.\r\nThere were different types of gravity in these four ages, as if the laws of physics that we know here, do not apply there. After trying many times, I finally managed to match the law of physics in the ages with the one we know here on earth.\r\n\r\nThis however was a few years ago. I haven't visited the places recently because I am already on the hunt for new ones. If someone else that has my capibilities found anything, it might be possible that the route system has changed. Anyhow, the four ages are now open for public visits. Normal people can't break things, really.\r\n\r\nAs I said, there are four ages:\r\n\r\nMechan Age:\r\n\r\nIt's an age I actually build myself. It's a complex mechanism that calibrates any visitor. Everybody starts here and has to travel into the red forcefield. By doing that, the hidden systems are checking the mass, velocity capabilities and volume of the subject. This is required to do, or else travelling through the different ages can go horribly wrong since the gravity I added is not the gravity that exists there already.\r\n\r\nThekgon Age:\r\n\r\nThis is the first age I discovered. It's a HUGE machine. I wish I could see this machine in the time it actually worked, because it looks like nothing more than a concrete building now. It's a machine that controlled gravity (just imagine the countless possibilities we could do with gravity here on earth if we managed to bring it home!), I bet it was able to change the force of gravity. Anyhow, right now it's capable of doing nothing. It froze. There are even materials hanging in a line, as if a force disappeared which froze everything that was in it.\r\n\r\nI did however find a knot in the existing gravity force. I could not risk travellers to get caught in this, so I made a building around it. No one may ever get inside of it, I felt very aggressive all of a sudden when I got near, as if I wanted to kill someone.\r\n\r\nDarkodia Age:\r\n\r\nI can't say much about this age. Unlike the machine in Thekgon, this machine seems to be working. It just doesn't do anything. I assume it's some sort of catalyst for energy or power. This needs more investigation. I do find it safe enough for travellers to visit, but if any visitor ever gets caught up in some kind of power, then I'd better close this age..\r\n\r\nCranger Age:\r\n\r\nThis age looks like it has been bigger thousands of years ago, as if these buildings are leftovers of a big city. Anyhow, it has nothing dangerous or special, everything is made by either brick, metal or glass. I have to say though that travellers might have a hard time seeing everything since the path is quite complicated.\r\n\r\n--BORING MAP SYSTEM EXPLAINATION FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT FANTASY--\r\n\r\nYou have 5 minutes to complete the map. After 5 minutes everybody is teleported to a jail where they can kill each other. The further you get in the map, the better your weapon will be.\r\n\r\nIf someone completes the map, nobody gets a gun except for the winner.\r\n\r\nTimer starts when the first player starts surfing."
