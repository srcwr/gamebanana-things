I present to you my map “de_runoff_hotrap” for \"Counter-Strike: Source\" – a huge and atmospheric map for real hardcore players (<i>–bomb/diffuse mission; download below</i>).<br>I worked much on this map. I hope for you will be exciting to play. -)<br>I am game developer, but in such way I accumulate experience in level-design and keep fit.<br>This map is created on the basis of map from “Half-Life 2 Deathmatch” – just I have taken a level with almost empty walls and removed the nonworking elements and made a playable map for \"Counter-Strike: Source\".<br>So here is everything you need to play, plus special ambient sound, also I added a tactical places for snipers or for a sudden attack, plus some \"landmarks\" and even a map for radar.<br>I made more destructible objects, including destructible columns and some walls.<br>Plus, I made the bridge from point \"B\" to fall after the explosion and it is completely destroyed in real time.<br>And at the point \"A\" the main computer of power station also will break and fall after the explosion.<br>Plus added new effects (<i>electrical discharges</i>) and sound-fx to the power station.<br><br>I significantly expanded the area of action – there is three parts of the map that were previously inaccessible. So, yeah – it's a really huge map! ;)<br>I introduced two crows which flies In the sky and they can be shot with any weapon (<i>the birds don`t exists in Counter-Strike, so I took them from Half-Life 2 and I made them to fly on the trajectories</i>).<br>I also seriously edited navigation paths of bots, that to be more interesting to play with them.<br>Plus is increased significantly the optimization.<br>Also for this map I introduced a special gameplay element, named as \"Hot Trap\" (<i>that I invented earlier for my map \"cs_lockdown_hotrap\"</i>).<br><br>Press on \"Manual Download\" and just download the archive. :)<br>------------------------------------------<br>Background story of the map:<br>– In the country there is a big chaos! The political opposition began open rebellion. It feels like the Apocalypse is near.<br>Some small terrorist groups, who call themselves as rebels, are now engaged in a serious subversion.<br>Now you're on the power station (electricity generation station, power plant), near the border of the country, not far from City 17 (<i>-yeah, from \"Half-Life 2\" ;) – is visible the citadel</i>). This station is temporarily closed and working at half capacity.<br>According to the story of this map, terrorists attack the power station. But the anti-terrorists in the urgent order everything around mined with explosive barrels and so making \"hot traps\".<br>Use hot traps – fry the ass of your virtual opponents!<br>Powerful weapons and crafty tactics will make you cool and dangerous. <br>Also, Special Forces are very well armed. Good trophies are waiting for you inside! ;)<br>Have a good hunting! :)<br>------------------------------------------<br>Here is just a video of earlier beta-version:<br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5m0Ez_AlYCI\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
