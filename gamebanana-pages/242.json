Join when you come accross it and tell me what you think. Hopefully it will be at the top with most of the famous maps like Dustfun and Underground. I get new suggestions for the map and working towards making everyone happy with the map. Recently there has been a problem with rebel way so i will be testing out new rebel ways and hopefully get a good one that everyone is happy with.\r\n\r\n This map has..\r\n\r\n- 1 big jail - although since it was added people haven't really used it.\r\n- small cell.. with a suprise ;)\r\n- A wall, with text saying \"The Wall\" so people don't complain and say \"you didnt tell me which wall\" -.-\r\n- Gun Toss - yes.. it is the ramp on the stairs... i added a sign to help :)\r\n- S4S \r\n- Long rebel way.. that still hasnt been complete to everyones expectations\r\n\r\nBecause it is a hassle uploading each update i will test it privately through my dedicated server and see if it is better... \r\n\r\nHopefully Hosties server owners will take a few minutes to add my map to their server\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD!!!

The red inspection wall is breakable (with moderate damage) as to not cause stand offs.  \r\n- There is a sniper tower with 1 scout in it.\r\n- There is a fenced in area and a knife pit with no lips (button inside the pit brings the wall down for steps)\r\n- No buy zones but various guns around the map (scout, M4's, shotgun, grenades, flashes, deagles, and knives)\r\nLR games include:\r\n- Deagle toss on top of the T building onto cross-walk markings (2 heights to choose from)\r\n- Shot for shot (on the back cells by CT building marked with targets)\r\n- Knife/chicken fights (anywhere + the pit)\r\n- Tire race: Push the button between the two lanes by the pit to spawn tires.  On bell sound you push the tire as far as you can.

The bins at the bottom are labeled with K-D-K-D etc.  If it lands in K, the T gets to KILL the LR CT.  If it lands in D, the T is killed (DIES) by the CT.

This is a map for the hosties gametype, the CT's start outside in the sun and the T's start in a room underground that they need to climb out of. The map is based inside the hangar and has everything you could ever need for a hosties game with a little something extra. \r\n\r\nShot for Shot is located in the catwalks above in the hangar.\r\n\r\nArena is located under the Shot for Shot catwalk, their is a ladder to get out of it, just look closely.\r\n\r\nOne way wall near T spawn.\r\n\r\n4 prison cells.\r\n\r\nGun toss is located inside, their is a regular gun toss area and I added my own spin on gun toss as well. Opposite the regular gun toss is bucket gun toss. It is basically like playing basketball and the different buckets mean different things. Green means that the person who tosses loses, they are to be killed upon scoring a green. Blue means that the T can shoot an extra CT (so 2 in total), so go for it for an extra kill! Red, the most difficult one to score, means that the T who scores it, gets to kill all the remaining CT's. Now I know most people won't know or follow these rules, let alone read this paragraph, but I am just trying to makes things more interesting.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to ZaLoS, Butterknife and Phraggah for help with texturing, modeling and compiling.\r\n\r\nThis map sponsored by intox. Gaming, visit us at www.intoxGaming.com\r\n\r\nI will keep this in beta for now because I may do something over, but I will probably just go on to the next map, unless their is actual desire for a \"new\" final.\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"
