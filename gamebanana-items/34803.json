On similar maps Bot's playing very strongly depends from small (and seeming insignificant) nuances of a Navigation Mesh. And I tried to grind these fine details. How well it managed - to be judged to you! :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>Play and Test... also beware of the shadows hidden in a twilight! :D<br><br>\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\nTHEnub (for exciting and thrilled industrial-themed map).<br><br>\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Move in from the Dark :-)<br><br>"
