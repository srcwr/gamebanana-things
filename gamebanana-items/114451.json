They can then try to use jumppads, the central flank beneath the satellite or one of the side flanks to get to the enemy base.\r\nTaking the southern flank provides you with no cover by the central satellite while the southern route does provide you with cover but also makes you easily visible because of the bright spinning circles around the map.\r\n\r\nThere are AWPs next to each spawn that you can only pick up with haphazardous strafe jumps that leave you extremely vulnerable to enemy fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTextures are by <a href=\"http://www.philipk.net/index.html\">Philip K</a>. For the 3D Sky, I used some NASA pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore projects at <a href=\"http://www.acidmaps.net\">acidmaps.net</a>.
