Basically just an earlier version of 2Fort without the TF2 assets.<br><br>Includes an (autogenerated) nav mesh, a couple paths closed off because the bots kept getting themselves stuck, and some water beneath the bridge, because there wasn't any there at first for some reason.<br><br>Other than that, I didn't change anything. There's no bomb site or hostages, it's just a Deathmatch-like map.<br>"
