Because this map was based in $2000$ CSS version by Calou, but this one was <u>totally</u> made by me, and I decided to keep the name style, ofc I had to change something so thats the name I chose.\r\n\r\nNot much to say, I just added the weapons in the end added a few more detail, and soundscapes when I finished, and this is the result.\r\n\r\nCredits go essencially to Calou, as he made the original map. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone and I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
