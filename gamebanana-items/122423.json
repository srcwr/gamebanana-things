	"_sText": "You might notice that this map borrows heavily from the roof area of dune, I found that alot of the time people spent was up there, so I revamped the roof and put it in its own map with ways to speed up (conveyors) except for the very top of the map, there are always two multicolored paths, the one on the right side will always push you forward (jump for more speed.)\r\n\r\nNo weapons placed on the map (buy zones in spawns.), bombs can be planted on the middle five glass bridges between the two halves of the roof. Bombs can be found within the middle cavity of the map on top of the ramp where there are notches cut into it.\r\n\r\nFalling off the map will teleport you into the pseudo-jail. The part you're teleported to is intentionally dark, but you can find your way out easily then use the conveyors to fly out of the middle area and back to where the bombs can be planted/defused."
