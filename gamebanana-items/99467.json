There are 52 spawn points, the escape zone is where it was in AA(under the garage door at the helipad building)  CTs spawn where VIP spawned in AA(at the back of the hospital), and the Ts spawn where Escort spawned in AA.  Hostages spawn with the CTs.\r\n\r\n*There is also a VIP version in the link below*\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/72745\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the Tactical Gamers and to Bodazephyr for beta testing.\r\n"
