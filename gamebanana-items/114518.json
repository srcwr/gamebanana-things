Features of the map include:\r\n\r\nTwo castles, with surrounding moats (with underwater tunnel)...\r\nAn underground, which is very dark and is cool for knife battles.\r\nYou can get into the castles by running around the outside wall and jumping onto them from the back.\r\nReal Mario textures.\r\n+ some other random stuff.\r\n\r\nI'll see how it is received.  Anyway, download it and play it for yourself."
