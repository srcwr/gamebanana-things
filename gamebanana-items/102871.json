	"_sText": "A narrow, corridor-style map with loads of custom details. Inspired from Doom 3, it's dark and spooky. Supports a max of 42 players (21 spawns per side) but it's not suggested you play with that many at once.\r\n\r\nDue to the ammount of detail there are some FPS drops in a few rooms, but it still runs at an average of 40fps+ on my system (Athlon MP 2600, Radeon 9500pro)"
