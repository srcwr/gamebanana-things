	"_sText": "Short fast paced Fight Yard Map. Max of 20 players. The map also includes a good amount of secret hiding spots, breakables, towers, tunnels, etc... Overall fast paced map. Within the next month I'm coming out with a new version that will be zombie mod. In that the textures will be revamped and a little more than just flat flat. This is more of a beta to see if users enjoy the map. Please comment and tell me the flaws and positives. Thanks!"
