	"_sText": "**THIS VERSION WORKS FINE! FEEL FREE TO UPLOAD TO YOUR SERVER!**\r\n\r\n**CS GO version can be found [here](http://csgo.gamebanana.com/maps/182680 \"Ba_Jail_Canyondam_GO\").**\r\n\r\nNewest version of Canyondam! And hopefully final.\r\n\r\n**Map's content**\r\n\r\n- Armory: 15 CT spawns\r\n- Cellblock: 6 big cells and 12 little cells / in total 48 spawns, 3 secrets in cells\r\n- Mainhall: 3 minigames, access to dam tunnels and some tables\r\n- Medic\r\n- Waterpolo, showers\r\n- Minigames: Choose Your Couch, Box Race, Sky Race, Shoot 'Em Up, Boat Wars and Dodgeball!\r\n- Basketball\r\n- Theater\r\n- Dam tunnels: 2 new exits, control room and secrets\r\n\r\n**What got changed?**\r\n\r\n- Removed Disco due to high number of entities it had\r\n- Removed Pool due to lack of use\r\n- Removed Cafeteria due to lack of use/details\r\n- Removed Hot Potato and some other minigames due to high entity data\r\n- Changed most of the textures to Black Mesa's ones\r\n- Relocated Theater and Dodgeball\r\n- Fixed some gameplay issues \r\n- Removed Super AWP\r\n\r\nEven though the map is large in comparison with other jailbreak maps out there, It's still very easy to play on. All games have been labeled and even as a new player you'll learn the map quickly. \r\n\r\nIn terms of optimization, I've done my best. If you get terribly low FPS while playing, I suggest you to disable HDR and tweak your graphic-settings. \r\n\r\nFeedback is much appreciated as always. I do ask you to spend some time testing the map and writing the feedback. If you decide to rate the map, I would like to hear why did/didn't you like it. Unjustified ratings may be deleted.\r\n\r\n**Known bugs** \r\n\r\n- Entity caused lag-spikes (0-5 times per round)\r\n- Some misaligned textures\r\n- Wrong textures in some places\r\n- High number of entities in certain areas\r\n\r\nThose issues will be fixed at some point.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading this map. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to share them with me!"
