The moon shines over the bright buildings and into the map where terrorists and counter-terrorists fight to the death in an epic fight. There can only be one winner and he will be THE GUNGAME CHAMPION!\r\n\r\nIt could look dark but I did my best to make it as bright as I could without ruining the weather."
