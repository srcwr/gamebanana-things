	"_sText": "Well this is my 3rd map.\r\nThis is like a small saga so this is a return to the previous map that I made, making it alot bigger and alot better looking.\r\nThe azdu is aztec and dust into one, the theme follows this and so does the textures.\r\nI tryed to create a map which has balance, so that zombies dont overrun it and also that people cannot camp in impossible places, which slows the game down.\r\nThere is a dedicated campers room, I hope they enjoy it.\r\nOverall im pretty happy with it, I think it#s a big improvment over my last map, the next one will be even better.\r\nI would have liked to have done alot more with the displacement but it leaks and becomes alot of work and I have spent alot of time on this already.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy."
