	"_sText": "Another CS:S version of the original cs_crackhouse. A lot of new stuff added, including new routes to/from the house. A .nav file is included for the bots. The map takes advantage of the lightning system as the lights in the house can be put out from a remote building. This makes use for the nightvision and adds some tactics."
