A code bar is a number in binary, that you must change to decimal (There are many websites where you can do the change like http://www.disfrutalasmatematicas.com/numeros/binario-decimal-hexadecimal-conversor.html), BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN MIND THAT LOGIC COMPARES MAKE YOU SWAP NUMBERS IN THE OTHER WAY(this is because of logic compare). Ex: 1369 is the code bar, and the password is 9631. With this system there are 8191 different passwords, so anyone can enter if they don't know this ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can check it on my surf map: http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/159210"
