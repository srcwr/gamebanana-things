The map has 20 spawns on each side so it can handle a bunch of people. \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to TomGreen For getting me back into mapping.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nYou do not need to download any custom textures to get this to work, they are included in the bsp.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nTo install place the .bsp file and the .nav file in cstrike/maps"
