	"_sText": "<p>Pretty much a kz map, there's no triggers, but I don't actually play kz on source and I intended auto players to be able to do this map too so it's kz_bhop_. It has no triggers, but the level design allows you to have some fuck ups without it completely destroying your run. The tip is there for people who don't have much mouse pad space, as it requires less room to do that ladder strafe backwards than forwards. The map is around 50 seconds to a minute long on scroll.</p><p><br></p><p>Please tell me if there's any issues, and enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlOjOEKKlmw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>"
