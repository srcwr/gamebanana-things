	"_sText": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is a BETA version of my newly created map where CT's must prevent the T's and defuse the threatening bomb and where's its planted. Unlike most DE Maps this map only has one bomb site to ensure both team can get there in enough time to get to the site and plant or camp easily. CT's will have a house at their spawn. So they can camp out with AWPs and guns to ensure the T's don't make it easy to get to the bombsite.I have made this map easy for starters and the next release will be much more stylish. This map also has some secrets for the CT's. Like breakable walls, ramp to get out of the house and gate and much more! If you have any problems that i have not mentioned please do so as to PM or provide the fact or problem in the Feedback.\r\n\r\nAlso sorry i didn't put ammo in the guns. Next time! :)\r\n\r\n1337TF2\r\n\r\nProviding maps since Jan 2009! :)"
