	"_sText": "A few nights ago me and my friend Daxe worked on a CS:GO aim map based on this two pillbox concept. The original map is still being worked on because aim on CSGO requires 12 arenas. CSS doesn't have a aim mode, at least not one i've seen. So i decided to remake the map in CS:S, it only has one arena so its more like a 1v1 map than an aim map.<br><br>My friend who made the CSGO map can be found here (Since he doesnt have a gamebanana account because of the Workshop.)<br><br>Readme Inside (MAP CONTAINS SECRET DOSE!)"
