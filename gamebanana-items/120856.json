	"_sText": "I made this map to be fun not to be structural and complex. I wanted this to be more enjoying to play and people have fun. Ok when you spawn you will go down the spawn to your buy zone then you have a choice of sliding down to the T spawn or going on top with the T's into a kinda deagle style map. Then you have teleports all over the place so you can find some secret rooms and platforms to AWP from. So when you DL this map tell me how you like it."
