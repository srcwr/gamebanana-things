Extremely fun for a short period and I would recommend for any server if you manage to obtain a script that switches loser with a spectator (I will see if I can make one of these).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for better ways to make this more than 1 v 1 OR If you would like a version with something other than deagle I would be happy to do it, I have a shotgun version and a scout version."
