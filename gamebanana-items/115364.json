It rains a few grenades at the begining onto the spawn. Every player starts with an MP5 and at left and right sides for each respective team is a little place to camp and Elites for Ts and a Deagle for CTs. There are some defences like drinks machines and crates to even it out a little. Be quick off the mark!"
