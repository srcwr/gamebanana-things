	"_sText": "This map was inspired by Drewdown's Drew_gg_paintball_forest. Though not the same map it is simular with a big tree house that the t's have to blow up. The screenshots are darker than the map really is in game. I think you will really like this map. Thanks to the S|N guys who put there ideas into this map. Before a map is finalized and put up for download it gets played on our server and determined if it is good enough. That said here it is."
