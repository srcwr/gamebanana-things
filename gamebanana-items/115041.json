I went through several level designs to find out what makes a good gun game map.\r\n\r\nTurns it simplicity is the key, this map is beautifully presented with that note in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize: Small\r\n\r\nPlayers: 10 - 22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap created by me, textures created by me.\r\n\r\nIt's in .pak so no need to download any textures, they're embedded in the map.\r\n\r\nI plan to make more in a similar fashion. Please tell me what you think!"
