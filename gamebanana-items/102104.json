But Major_Soulreaver had other ideas.. with all the Terrorists he could find he set out to stop MoggieXmas's plans!\r\n\r\nCounter-terrorists - Protect the presents against the terrorists. Watch out for MoggieXmas's rushes!\r\n\r\nTerrorists - You have only a short time to blow up the presents. If your lucky you will have been given $1600 by some n00b to make it abit easier for you. Watch out at short A as some n00b might be spamming nades!\r\n\r\nMapping - Lagmonster\r\n\r\nOptimization - Alias\r\n\r\nBeta Testers - DUNK, Wingnut, Major_Soulreaver, Manny, Retro and Team MX\r\n\r\nThanks - Thanks to Riley & Bling Bling for the MoggieXmas image\r\n\r\nThanks to Alias @ UKCS for helping optimize the map, bit of a disspointment the first version - but this time it's even better! Thankyou MOX @ UKCS for getting me intouch with your mappers :D\r\n\r\nThankyou to everyone posting the first version on forums and spreading the map around :) I did join up to a few and post some comments :D\r\n\r\nThanks to MoggieX for hosting the first version on UKMD and giving it a test!\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map over christmas!\r\n\r\nUKMD Team MX - HAPPY XMAS N00BS !\r\nhttp://www.ukmandown.co.uk/"
