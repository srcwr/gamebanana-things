There's a buyzone at spawn..... um, it's kinda short.\r\n\r\nAnd yes I made it (it says dynamic on ct spawn).\r\n\r\nYa know to be honest, the map is crap, but I've gotten quite abit of praise from it, and I decided to put it on here.. atleast it's fun.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have sv_airaccelerate to 100 atleast\r\n\r\n            -Dynamic"
