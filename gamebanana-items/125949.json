	"_sText": "To learn why this map was made (before you go judging about tacky dev textures and simple design) please refer to this:\r\nhttp://gamebanana.com/wips/43453\r\n\r\nThis was tested and intended for 100 tick auto-hop.  It is playable on 66 tick, but untested in legit settings.  Easy map, roughly 50-60 seconds worth of gameplay if completed without failure.  Four stages, five checkpoints.\r\n\r\nI'm open to any feedback for gameplay or design\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy it :D"
