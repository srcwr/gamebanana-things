It had some glitches, like the water glitch, and blocking when played on a server with many slots.\r\n\r\n1. 2 New boatescapes, arctic boats.\r\n\r\n2. When calling rescue, both will arrive around 30 seconds, and leave after 10 when u jump on boat or press the button in the lift/tramp.\r\n\r\n3. Total 4 ropes in second part of the cave. Also added a icebridge, that speeds up the way a lil. But breaks after 5 seconds when passing it, you have to be quick.\r\n\r\n4. Removed second igloo, this time just shoot on electric generator and then hit the tnt in the igloo.\r\nAlso removed the gate/fence, you needed to jump on snowmans hat to break. \r\n\r\n5. Made more ways to the ladders\r\n\r\n6. Ladders are wider now.\r\n\r\n*7. There is a secret spot/way where activate 2 traps \"doesnt kill\".\r\n\r\n8. Nuke has sound, also made more houses for the fights, if zombies come by boats or tramp/lift.\r\n\r\n9. Added props, boxes and vending machines, so you can defend the escape zone. *NOTE: There is a trap at the escape zone that instant kills when being pressed, you have to be in time and you only have one chance each round*\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading & playing it!\r\n\r\n//Westsid3r\r\n"
