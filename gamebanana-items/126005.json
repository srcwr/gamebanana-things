	"_sText": "<p><u>bhop_slate</u></p><p>Started creating this map in late 2014, and finished today. It's a bhop/kz map that takes some time to complete, but not as long as bench or something. It had a lot of extra content that I've left out due to time restrictions, including a kz bonus. In it's place, I've created a regular bhop bonus for people to play when they can't beat the actual map. It's probably more fun on auto.</p><p>This map isn't hugely difficult, but it's not for beginners.</p><p>I understand there are a few 1hop glitches, but that's because I don't know how tony's triggers work. My bad.</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p><br></p>"
