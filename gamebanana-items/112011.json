	"_sText": "Beta Version of the map, just looking to the community for suggestions to make it better.\r\n\r\nThe final will have more weapons and sounds.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs you find or any suggestions you have to me.\r\n\r\nAll ideas will be considered.\r\n\r\nThe map has 48 spawn points but this number is not recommended for this version, because of the lack of weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my remake of a map called \"dead simple\" from Doom3, the platforms lower to remove cover spots, and the map has teleporters.  The map currently only has 2 mp5's, 2 pump shottys, 1 auto shotty, 1 P90, 2 M249's, 1 M4A1, 1 scout, 1 AWP, and 1 AK47.  The map also has health packs, all weapon pickups glow and spin (just like in doom).  The platform in the middle rises to another platform where you can find the 2 sniper rifles.  Almost the whole map is visible from the platform. \r\n\r\nTo get to the rising platform you have to be teleported, here is a tip: Don't be scared to fall.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks to Karatek√§fer for the awesome skybox!"
