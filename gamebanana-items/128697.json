At first I wanted to fix the elevator, but eventually I worked on revamping most of the map.</p><h2>Changes</h2><p></p><ul><li><span>Two secret AWPs with trails, and one MP5.</span><br></li><li><span>Brushwork cleaned up a bit with some optimizations that may make the map run a bit better for some people.</span></li><li>Lots of texture changes. Now uses militia skybox.</li><li>Lighting, shadows...</li><li>Each team now has 32 spawnpoints (previously 25). 7 CT spawns were moved to the pool.</li><li>Small ladder added behind the base of the tower.</li><li>Some boxes added to the roof, and a vending machine added to the lounge room (under vent).</li><li>Alignment of the ladder from T spawn to roof was fixed.</li><li>(hopefully) blocked some surf spots.</li><li>Elevator cleaned up and correctly aligned with the floors. There's also some elevator music and a vent on the ceiling. Elevator buttons now glow, too.</li><li>Weapon trails look smoother.</li><li>Pool stairs changed.</li><li>Cubemaps.</li><li>Vent cover is now transparent.</li><li>Replaced bottom floor beneath elevator to a player clip, so everything except players will fall through. This means that smoke grenades can't (well, shouldn't be able to) stop the elevator</li><li>secret game mode :)</li><li>...maybe too secret?</li></ul><p></p>"
