So I decided to change up KEY features and add special effect.\r\n\r\nThe objective of Murderball is to MURDER the other team by knifing the balls like soccer mod, you aim them at the other team and try to stay alive.\r\n\r\nIts pretty easy to pick up and a lot of fun with many people.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo I made for the map, was made about 2 years ago.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rDLJWDkE5FU&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rDLJWDkE5FU&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>"
