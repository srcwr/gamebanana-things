	"_sText": "Hi guys, \r\n\r\nHere is my new map, it's made up of 8 parts with increasing difficulty. It starts easy, but gets progressively harder. There is a bonus zone, and a longjump zone. I tried to make this map original with some new kind of levels and varied decorations. I made it with a dedication to my friend koryouz.\r\nI worked on this map for a very long time, and hope you enjoy it. :) \r\n\r\nYou will find 2 versions of the map in the download, the normal one, and a version without ladderjumps for those who don't like it.\r\n\r\nNote : you may have a big fps drop at green part, since the logic\\_timer is doing shit when you're not in that part...\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun!   \r\n                        \r\nPS : I apologize for those overused textures, but I didn't feel as though any other design would appropriately fit into these levels.    \r\n                     \r\nPPS : For some reason, sometimes a few particle systems may not spawn..."
