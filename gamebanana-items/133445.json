Theres no need to disapprove maps for no reason.  Seriously.\r\n\r\nThe 2 Buildings by spawn are elevators, just press \"use\" anywhere on them.  Same for the orange box in the very middle of the map. Buttons and everything will be coming in the final version.\r\n\r\nThis is not the final version.  look for an updated soon with much more content on the map!\r\n\r\n-krazy"
