It's a completely created from scratch and fully hand-tuned nav-file (because an original mapauthor's nav-file embedde in .bsp-file was slightly edited and not fully playable auto-gen).<br><br>This Navigation Mesh is create manually at 90% because in auto-generated Navigation Mesh some areas were made incorrectly and many paths were not preciese (almost all passes through a doorways and exits to balconies).<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh was fully Place Painted.<br><br>Well... bots use all possible ways now. And they have own apartments, with blackjack and hookers! :-)<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the nav-file by original map author available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/10900\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also share your game impressions with mates and friends ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nAldéz (for this excellent classic-styled map for closed battles).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Who can it be knocking at my door? :D<br><br>"
