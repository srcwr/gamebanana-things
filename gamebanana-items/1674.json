	"_sText": "This is just a random idea I came up with. It's a box with an m4 as bait. The screenshots don't show much, I've been trying to get a video but my programs messed up atm, so I'll just explain how it works here and post a video within a week or two. Okay well anyways. It looks like a simple box with an m4 in it. And that's really all it is until you walk into it. I set 3 triggers onto the box, right when you step in the box a sound goes off (Explosion_5) and then you suddenly burst up into the sky and then after 1.5 seconds of complete confusion theres an explosion. Screen shot 1 is what the box looks like, BORRINGGGG. Screenshot 2 is once you step near it, notice how I'm in the sky and don't know what happened. :P And screenshot 3 is when the explosion goes off, sorry for the horrible screenshots. Particularly #3, as I said I will have a video soon. Enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note* If your fast enough getting the m4 and running away then you can get it safely, but I doubt you'd really be expecting the explosion. :P"
