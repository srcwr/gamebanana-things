	"_sText": "Me and my buddy decided to do a collab together on this map and this is what we came up with its a trick/combat surf map very well detailed and lighting is done very well. we have tested this map very well since i bought a server just for testing maps so all of us in ^surftastic^ have tested it and we really enjoy it. it includes alot of custom textures and skybox. looking forward to playing it on servers with alot of people should be very fun. \r\nThere is a code to get out of jail there is 3 keys that need to be shot in order to get out of jail make sure you shoot the keys dead on or it wont open the gate. there is also a jail2 and jail3 secret teleports lead to them. Have fun finding them!"
