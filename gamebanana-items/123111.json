	"_sText": "This map took a while to make but it's finally done!<br><br><b>surf_technique</b> is a Tier 5 map with 7 Stages and 5 Bonuses.<br><br>The map is focused on gameplay oriented around using as few ramps as possible per stage but exploring one concept per stage. It relies heavily on surfing each ramp as well as possible.<br><br>The bonuses range from moderately easy to incredibly hard. I hope people have a fun challenge trying to complete them all!<br><br>Big thanks to not_a_zombie for helping out and testing a ton for a very long time. Also big thanks to beetle179 for testing and helping tweak red bonus to be very hard, as well as making my map more public via his stream.<br><br>Skybox by komaokc and dev textures by zaoman.<br><br>Thanks to Juxtapo for the video:<br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gix_G-RaaoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br><br>And thanks to everyone for playing my map :O<br>Enjoy!"
