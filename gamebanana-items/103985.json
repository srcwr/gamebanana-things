Such is some models and one little house how in the reality. \r\n  Textures in the majority were made by me so samo as models. I lent some from 3dmike and from the side garrysmod.org.\r\n  Thanks for Tepcio and all about which I forgot and they took the active part in the completion of the map.\r\n  \r\n  PS.\r\n    I know that there are several known bugs which I will not improve any more consciously on the map. That is why I recognise this the version of the map as final."
