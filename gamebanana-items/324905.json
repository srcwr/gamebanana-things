	"_sText": "This map was started shortly after the release of <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/125131\">bhop_goldsrc </a>as I had overwhelming requests to make a longer version of the bonus. In total, I managed to fit 10 Half-Life BSPs into one map. Brushsides are at 99.2% capacity with optimization already, otherwise I would've included more maps. Note that I modified all of the stages to improve them for auto-bhop, but I made sure they were possible on scroll as well. I've put together a playlist of some previous versions too. Many Half-Life BSPs were tested for map flow, but were cut. View it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epu89UWVe0s&amp;list=PLx5fr8e342X7ycmEryq-97xIjuTEHaNZt\">here</a>.<br><br>Enjoy!"
