	"_sText": "Yes the pun was intended:). This is my first published map. It is actually a deathmatch/fightyard map but i wanted to call it de_pressing as it is, well depressing. It is a dark and foggy map with storm sounds in the background. It can be used for a deathmatch or fight yard, something like that and has a max of 24 players(I tested it with bots for how squished you get and 24 it the best number) have fun and don't forget to rate :D"
