You spawn with a knife only, and unless you can make it to the top of jail by surfing well, the only ways to get a gun is to put a watermelon in a miniature golf like hole.  There is 12+ scouts laying around in the map along with a few AWPs in hard to reach places.  If you find your self stuck in jail there is a jail break button at the top of the middle waterfall that opens jail.  There are a few other secrets hidden in the map to. "
