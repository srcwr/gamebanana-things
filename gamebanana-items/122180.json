	"_sText": "I stayed very close to the original, and I think I did pretty well. This is a remake of the alltime classic map, surf_greatriver. I completely redid everything in this map, the ramps, the buildings, everything. The water is now visible, it is not fullbright anymore and it has cool textures. I also addes some new secrets and stuff. \n\nThis map is compiled with HDR, hence the excellent lighting quality.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nBy the way: LOL @ ' CHEK YUOR SPELING!...' when you submit this, stupid gamebanana, can't even spell himself"
