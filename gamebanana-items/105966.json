	"_sText": "This is a quick 20 minute map I made a while ago.  Just my own spin on the aim_ak-colt maps.  I made this when I first started mapping.\r\n\r\nIf you change the phys_pushscale to 150 or so, you can shoot the cars at other players, and hopefully kill them.  The barriers are also ladders, so you can climb on them and shoot from the top.\r\n\r\nCredits go to the original creator of aim_ak-colt, even though I didn't decompile the map and edit it.  I made this from scratch.\r\n\r\nHope ya'll like it."
