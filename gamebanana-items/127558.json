Therefore, do not complain about too few details and simply enjoy the long-awaited, extremely balanced and creative map \"trikz_RandomRaider\" (a bit of irony here). <br>\r\nIn contrast to the bhop maps I built before, this is a multiplayer based \"Trikz\" map and probably my last map ever. It was fun to build and test and I hope many people share my exitement. Play it as much as you can. Find all secrets. Complete all levels. Increase your skill. Have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt consists of:<br>\r\n- 30 Stages<br>\r\n- x2..x6 Flashboost<br>\r\n- 92..448 Units Skyboost<br>\r\n- 265..275 Units Slowmotion Longjump<br>\r\n- 1 Difficult Bonus<br>\r\n- 4 Secrets<br>\r\n- 1 Extremely Difficult Bonus <br>\r\n-> only playable, if everything has been finished (whole map, x5, 448u Sky, 274 LJ, Bonus 1)<br>\r\nAdditionally, two videos on youtube are provided. In case of being stuck in a stage/bonus - the conclusion might be assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeace,<br>\r\nRandom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/81esszXXCNc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \r\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GH0tS-UMm4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
