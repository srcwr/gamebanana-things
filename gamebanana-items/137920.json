	"_sText": "surf_treasurehunt is a t1 lineair surf map.<br><br>It was originally an attempt to make a lineair surf give different paths/skips, and this has been reflected in the skips that are possible.<br><br>It took about a month worth of time working at the map, originally sticking with self-crafted ramps in Hammer to details and environment, switching to Blender ramps and overall making the map more enjoyable to surf by adding a ton of skips. While I might not be a good visual designer, I do priorize making the surf enjoyable and as smooth as possible. I learned a lot of using Blender and implemented some of those elements in the map. The main map contains 0 teleport triggers, same for the bonusses.<br><br>In addition it has 2 bonuses: One is a previous sketch of the map, focusing around a single skip.<br><br>The second one is an mix of surf_treespam and surf_royal made easy.<br><br>Triggers have been added in order to make the starting/end zones.<br><br>Map tested and played with default Momentum Mod values, so unless you want to get launched keep the default values.<br>Credits:<br><br>Kompile (https://www.youtube.com/user/SDKompile) for making a video about creating ramps in Blender and the Blender plugin SURGE which allows for very simple Blender ramp creation.<br><br>Momentum Mod community for any questions regarding Source Hammer I had.<br><br>surf_sluice for inspiration for the sewer part<br><br>surf_treespam and surf_royal for bonus 2<br><br>This map will be ported to CS:GO soon, but since it was developed in CSS/Momentum Mod this is the main release.&nbsp;<br><br>"
