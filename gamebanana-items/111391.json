	"_sText": "Ok, I know there are PLENTY of Iceworld remakes. But, frankly they all suck. This one doesn't. It acually is worth playing. It gets decent frame rate. And because of the buildings it changs up gameplay.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 error's though. In the txt file where it tell's the objectives, there is a spelling error. Also, one of the lights in the building is too low and is off the ceiling a bit. Nothign that changes gameplay, or seriously ruins the map.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the only decent iceworld.... since iceworld itself.\r\n\r\nEDIT: There over 64 spawns I think. I haven't played with the full amount of people. It was made to have as many spawns as there are going to be players in the server."
