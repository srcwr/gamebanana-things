	"_sText": "<b>README FIRST:</b>\r\nThis is a first public BETA version ! Its a remake or clone from surf_japan.\r\n\r\nBut i did it <b>COMPLETE NEW FROM THE SCRATCH!</b> Not decompiled and edited like the other ones around here.\r\n\r\nI know the filesize is big (30 megabytes - without lightning 6 megabytes) and the FPS isnt real improved - but this a lack of the maindesign of the map. \r\n \r\n<b>DESCRIPTON:</b>\r\nThe most of you should know about this map. Its not a real surfmap in my eyes, its more a funmap. There is a basic jail and a bombspot. The bomspot is closed until you press the \"B\" button somewhere ^^ so look around for it. There is also a buyzone in this beta. \r\n \r\nIts really not finished so please post your comments and ideas for the final one.\r\n\r\nFor more screenshots and futher informations about this work goto: \r\n<a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/wips/view/8260><b>H-E-R-E</b> ;-)"
