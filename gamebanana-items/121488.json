I built this as a test of exactly how big could I make an outdoor environment with sdk(correctly) and still have stability in an mp environment ( I hit 62000 for you who know what i speak of, I believe 65000-68000 is max).  There are teleporters, health machines and a huge skybox for you low grav fans.  Sorry about the light map but the file got to be to big (30 mb) and this is not functional in hdr, to big again, fill rate issues.\r\n\r\nHave fun, \r\n\r\nUZY"
