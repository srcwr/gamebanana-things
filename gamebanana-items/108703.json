	"_sText": "This is the first map I actually published. Its not big, its made for improving your skill or just for playing with your friends for fun. It took me nearly half a day to make it, with all the lighting, details and messing around with textures so they don't look looped, because some of them do (by looping I mean you can see that in ends in the middle and its the same thing in squares). Hope you like it, or I'm not sure if you should, it's my first \"successful map\" I made I could say. It might look familiar to $2000$, because there's from I got my inspiration. Please don't hate about it just because it's my first map doesn't mean I cannot improve. Btw bots on normal are dominating me in this map for some reason. There are some easter eggs but most of them wont be able to be found without noclip. I'll let you find out what's in this map. Anyways, tell me what maps or ideas what I can do or maybe how can I improve it and what should I not do and fix something in this map, I'll try to. Happy frags.<br>"
