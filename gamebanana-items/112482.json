	"_sText": "This map was one of my experiments with different layouts for CS:S. I personally consider it successful. This is a large map with good fps that supports 64 players. Terrorists start from within the castle while Counter Terrorists have to assault it. The map features working drawbridges, shooting cannons, and asault ladders that can be pushed away from the top of the wall. Bots do not play on this map very well, they just aren't coded for this type of a map. You will get the real taste of the map when playing with 10+ people. As always - the more people, the more fun."
