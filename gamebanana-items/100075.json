	"_sText": "Since cs_kismayo was so well received by the css community, I felt I should release a new version featuring HDR.  \r\n\r\nA few small glitches and exploitable areas in the map were also fixed.  Also, this version features improved bot AI and place names.  The map still runs as fast and smoothly as the normal version.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy this map and look for my other maps.  The final version of another one of my maps, cs_symphony, was just released.  So go give it a shot.  Also, check out my map in progress, de_zenith, and give me feedback or suggestions for the final version of it.  Thank you for all of your support.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nOreo\r\njazzbassking@hotmail.com"
