	"_sText": "This is the second map I've worked on. The first was never released. (pretty much a learning/ testing map)  I wanted to do a relatively simple map and I've focused on game play more than details or beauty.  I tried to make the rush points interesting for shoot outs.  Both sides should reach the sandy bottem of Site-A area at about the same time withe the CTS just able to get into site(immediate site) /with shots possibly fired at them before entering or as entering.  Site B is indoors with a n entrance on both sides of the compound.  Cts can enter slightly faster than T's but shouldn't be fast enough to deny T's entry though the first T through may find a ct almost waiting for him (depending on spawn)  as for the middle route its a little more dicey with the ability to shoot and be shot at from compound and site-A area.  This middle route also offers the option of a window entry into site B  or a free fall with safe water landing   near site A.  T's also have the ability to rush and access the roof  of the Dam control compound and have a choice of 3  sunlight windows they can drop through."
