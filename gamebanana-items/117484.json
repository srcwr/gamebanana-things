	"_sText": "This is a redesigned version of the Block Forts arena from Mario Kart 64.  I wanted to use this map to learn how to design maps and how the basics of hammer work (such as textures, vector manipulation, etc.).  I do know that in the back hallways of the buildings, where it's dark (on purpose, as they're surprise spawns), there's a few spots of light that seem out of place.  If anyone has any ideas how to fix that, let me know please. ;)\r\n\r\nFeel free to post any comments, suggestions, and criticisms.  :D\r\n\r\n(Also, big thanks to everyone who helped me from <a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/threads/81579>this</a> and <a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/threads/82964>this</a> thread!)"
