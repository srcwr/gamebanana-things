The map has a longjump room, a bonus and a secret.<br><br>Start and end zones are marked. HDR+Bloom recommended.<br><br><h2>Bad framerate?</h2>Enable multicore rendering (mat_queue_mode -1). This will improve rendering times, specifically static prop rendering. I did what I could to optimize the map and had to halt adding more detail because of this reason.<br><br><h3>EDITS</h3><br>18 Aug 2023 - Update 2 (u2) Small gameplay changes & a lot of skip fixes. See changelog.<br>25 Dec 2016 - Update 1 (u1) Slight changes to make it easier."
