	"_sText": "This map is not your normal surf map, and loading it thinking your going to start, have to surf to a gun, then teleport back to spawn and kill AFKer is not a good approach.\r\n\r\nThis is a fast, fun filled, intense deathmatch surf map, where your quick, or your dead.\r\n\r\nNo way to describe it other then we often have first to 500 kills comps on this map.\r\n\r\nThis map is only really playable wit the deathmatch plugin as heres no guns around the surf, and youll often be spawn killed..\r\n\r\ngive it a go, its great fun\r\n\r\nP.S. I havnt included the CT and T textures for the teleporters simply because they are custom and I dunno who made them, ill make a final release within a few weeks, with many improvements.\r\n\r\nENJOY!"
