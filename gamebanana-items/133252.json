	"_sText": "This is a map I put together in about two days. It features breakable crates (most of them), strategic firing lanes, and great scenery (you should have seen how many env_cubemaps I stuffed in this map to make it look that much better). Even though it took me only 2 days to make, I did not skip any details, I was probably done with the layout of the map in half a day and the rest of the time was spent on putting the details into the map (snow displacements everywhere, fogging effects around the water, lighting effects, snowflakes falling...). I hope you enjoy playing this map as much as I did making it."
