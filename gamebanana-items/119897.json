	"_sText": "One day, I decided to make a map where players can take a shield, be a medic to health people or an engineer. These class are available in this map. I use to play at Jail's servers where people use to go to disco or play football. So i put a field where they can play football and voleyball. There is a big disco, an area where Cts can order to go there. \r\n\r\n-Medics can heal other if they are near of people who need their.\r\n-Swats have got a shield.\r\n-Engineers have got a gun with a nice ammo. \r\n\r\nI put some holes where players can stay protected (Pic. 5)\r\n\r\nIf CTs don't want choose a class there are dispensers of guns or they can just buy the weapons.\r\n\r\n"
