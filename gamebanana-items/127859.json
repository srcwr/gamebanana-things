There are also random events that occur occasionally at the start of each round, which will open up more rooms, keep an eye out! (Not much as of now, but I'm hoping I'll kick myself into gear and finish something.)<br><br>Kind of story based, somehow. . . if I'd finish the darn thing.<br><br>It's not finished yet, and I'm not sure it ever will be, maybe another 5 years from now. Anyhow, enjoy!<br><br>"
