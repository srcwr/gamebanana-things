There wasn't a notable problem with cs_Metropolis, but I included it for safe measures. If you do not, Terrorists on cs_Alley will be stuck in their spawn and not be able to get out.\r\n\r\n**I give you permission to download these maps and use them on your server/suggest them to other servers without consulting me.\r\n_However,_ I do not give you permission to re-upload, with or without altering, without consulting me first.**\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions:\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nDrag and drop the .bsp and .nav files into your Counter Strike maps folder.\r\n\r\nPossible folder locations:\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nIf you installed CS:S onto your main/internal hard drive, it should be in one of those locations unless you selected an alternate install location.\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n**(Lemon) WUNDerDUDe2312**"
