There might be some others thrown in there. There is 2 bomb sites, which you can see on the overview screenshot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first beta so all complaints and bugs should be posted here please :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: If you use this map on your server at all please post here so I can play it :)\r\nPSS: The pakrating was painfull so if you have an error with the banner or the overview please post, but there shouldn't be."
