	"_sText": "This map is a dev aim texture map. Basically there are 4 towers with 3 levels including ground each on the corners. There are paths connecting the middle levels and leading to the top level. In the center is a tree that can be used to go cross towers. The bottom level has scattered boxes for cover as well as 2 entrances per tower.\r\n\r\nThe top of the tower was modified from a tower in aim_ag_texture made by SixThree.\r\n\r\nPlease provide feedback. If you upload it to your server or use it to make another map, I'd love to hear about it through a private message or by posting here."
