There is a scout on top \r\nof the covered bridge, smoke and HE grenades on the cornered balconies, an m4 in the \r\nT-spawn vent, and an AK in the CT-spawn vent. To retrieve the vent weapons, simply\r\nbuy a nade, and toss it in the vent (it works best if you hit the very top of the slanted\r\npiece). Have fun!\r\n=====================================================================\r\nThe only difference between the maps is the \"gg\" map (Gungame, of course) \r\nhas the buyzones and weapons taken out, as well as the vent.\r\n=====================================================================\r\nFeel free to send comments and/or suggestions to arekuthelastspartan@hotmail.com\r\n"
