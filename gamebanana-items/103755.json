It's purpose is to reduce filesize and provide more normal \"classic\" gameplay. The things that affect gameplay and are not found in normal maps are removed (the built-in speed &amp; gravity mods etc). This is for all the CSS junkies who get very angry when they can't buy their own gun, can't run up a ladder or can't fall 4 meters without getting hurt. So if you want to play this unique map but with normal gameplay, this lite version is for you.\r\nI have worked very hard on this for more than a year. Much time and research has gone into making the ship and its layout as realistic as possible - gameplay balance was less important. Most time and work has gone into getting this huge map to compile without critical errors! Please provide constructive criticism and bug reports to help me improve later versions.\r\n(If you really want a version with only 1 Terrorist spawn area, just ask and I will make one for you)\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nmap, custom textures, most custom sounds &amp; all sound editing by Olivier Doorenbos\r\nwww.CGTextures.com - source of most raw custom textures\r\ndasboot music by Klaus Doldinger\r\nship horn sound from www.youtube.com/BIGMIKESOCAL\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES:\r\nYou can do whatever you want (distribute, edit the VMF file, release modified version etc) as long as you give me credit where it is due and do not profit financially. If you distribute this map, you must include THIS README.\r\n\r\nThe VMF file is not included in this lite version so if you want it (and most of the map's custom resources) for use in your own projects:\r\n<a href=\"//www.filefront.com/14758417/ropax_VMF_resources.zip/\">http://www.filefront.com/14758417/ropax_VMF_resources.zip/</a>"
