	"_sText": "This is my rendition of the Shadow Moses Island Nuclear Waste Disposal Facility from Metal Gear: Solid. Note that it is in the Beta state. I am looking for advice from testers, and am still in the process of optimization. \r\n\r\nCurrently it is a bomb map. There is one game-play flaw that I am familiar with: the fact that the Tank hanger acts as a crunch point (only two main entrances). This is unavoidable, for that is how the level is in mgs. Recommendations accepted.\r\n<hr width=\"2\" size=\"50%\" color=\"gray\" />\r\n<b>Update:</b> File has been optimized, details have been added, 3d skybox added, crunch point problem improved, background sounds added, environmental lighting added, colour correction improved."
