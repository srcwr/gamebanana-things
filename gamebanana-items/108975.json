The whole thing took me about 40mins to make so its pretty basic. \r\n\r\nOverall its a quite fun map for a few rounds but it does have a problem getting to the top of the struture requires the player to swin a long distance underwater, you can make it with about 60  health remaining or even 100 if you manage to get a breath going up.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nDont forget to check out www.dbgaming.co.uk for any new map release by either me or MRT.\r\n\r\n\r\n.Nodachi."
