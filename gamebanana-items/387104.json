	"_sText": "This is a new map I've made in over a month. DE ROGER GOIS. What does this mean? Well, the meaning of the name is from a random player that joined and server and left. Although he never spoke and wasn't there for a long time, he was not forgotten. Thus, this map name was decided. I also wanted to make a map where bots could get hit by cars, but not endanger real players so this was fun. <br><br>It's a small defusal map. The terrorists have taken over an old warehouse and are planning to destroy the gas station (the gois station) or blow up the water facility down the alleyway. Either way the walk will only be about 15-20 seconds. The counter-terrorists were called in to investigate after a car had crashed and after receiving a report of terrorists afoot hiding somewhere. So, they park their vehicles outside the gois station and check out the office. However, the building was closed and nobody was home, which leaves only the warehouse...  Good luck!<br><br>Disclaimer: I don't know how balanced this map is in PvP because it was made for adaptive bots, but feel free to give feedback. I imagine that no matter how many people play whichever team strategizes more will dominate either side of the map."
