Yeah, I'm not kidding, this map is based on the massassi temples on Yavin IV from Star Wars.\r\nRead for more information please.\r\nThis Map is a Port from the Game \"Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy\", which is running on the Quake III Arena Engine.\r\nIt's a Duel-Map, which I created on October 18 2008.\r\nNow I wanted to discover the possibilities of Valve's powerful Source Engine, so I started the quickest possible project, porting an old map from me.\r\nThe result was an aztec-themed aim map. The Map itself has no changes since the 2008 Version, I added only CS:S-Textures, new light and the platform with the awp.\r\nThe brushes are unedited, so I have to say sorry.\r\nIt is planned to port this map one day for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, where I will try to edit every single detail.\r\nAn Day of Defeat: Source Version is currently under development with a lot of extras.\r\nI hope you will have fun with my first Counter-Strike Map.\r\n\r\nYou don't like aim-maps? There is also a ka_yavin_arena! ka_* means Knife Arena.\r\nUse google or search on the same site where you found this map here.\r\n\r\nThe Jedi Academy Version can be found on Filefront:\r\nhttp://jediknight3.filefront.com/file/Yavin_IV_Jedi_Academy_Trainingroom;95080\r\n=================================================\r\n\"Map Information\"\r\n\r\nBot Support:\tYes\r\nNew Textures:\tNo (using almost only aztec textures)\r\nNew Models:\tNo\r\nNew Sounds:\tNo\r\nNew Music:\tNo\r\nGame Types:\tAim (aim_*)\r\nBrushes:\t86\r\nEntinities:\t...\r\nMax Players:\t12\r\n\r\nUsed Programs:\r\n\r\nSource SDK\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy Version in 2008 I used also:\r\n\r\nGTK Radiant 1.4\r\npakscape\r\nPaint\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install this map:\r\n\r\nExtract \"aim_yavin_arena.bsp\" and \"aim_yavin_arena.nav\" into your cstrike/maps folder.\r\nThis should look like this for example:\r\nE:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\>Your Steam Account Name<\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but this map doesn't work in Garrys Mod. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy other Map-Project at the moment are:\r\n\r\n- Luke's Mission at Cairn Bay: http://www.moddb.com/mods/lukes-mission-at-cairn-bay\r\n- Porting this Map (dod_yavin_arena) for Day of Defeat: Source\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback for me or bugs to report, so please write me a comment where you downloaded the map.\r\nAsk me before using this map for your own projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright/Permissions:\r\n\r\nTHIS LEVEL IS NOT MADE, DISTRIBUTED, OR SUPPORTED BY VALVE CORPORATION AND/OR ITS LICENSORS."
