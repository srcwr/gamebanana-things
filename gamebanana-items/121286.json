	"_sText": "Originally made privately for a scouts server called EKR. Ive decided to release it to the public because it turned out pretty well. I was contemplating releasing this, seeing as its just a retexture/minor additions. But what the hell, Some people might enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks To RaptorJesus (Ben) For the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do not rename this map. People have been getting maps mixed up because of renaming. This file is and always will be the original . So if it says your map versions are different. just download this one."
