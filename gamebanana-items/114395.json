The scale and textures are a little different, but the layout is identical to the original.\r\n\r\nThis is a very fast paced map with many weapons on the upper level (spawn), Grenades and a Buyzone are in the middle on the lower level.  \r\n\r\nPlease note this map was designed for super-fast \"kill it if it moves\" games.  Expect rounds to last no longer than 30 seconds\r\n\r\nOriginal author credited in the map.\r\n\r\n"
