Some people are right. Seemingly nothing can be improved on this masterpiece of a map, combining science and religion into a single map, made for YOUR enjoyment!\r\nAnd enjoy it I hope you do!! ~Aux\r\n\r\n(PS. The map should be doable on any setting, other than 400u/s cap... I'm not sure about that one)"
