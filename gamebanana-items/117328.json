After all, this is my first CS:S map. I just got CS:S one day ago, and I would like to make a map.\r\n\r\nThe game:\r\n\r\nYou start out in a trapped area, and you have ten seconds to buy your stuff. (That is long enough for noobs or newcomers to buy stuff.)\r\n\r\nThen The platform is raised, and people fight to the death.\r\n\r\nThere are four special spawn areas, and you might be spawning there.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo yeah.\r\n\r\nSimple, fun, and etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nUP TO 24 PLAYERS, or something might happen if you have 32.\r\n\r\nI only had good room for 24 ppl playing."
