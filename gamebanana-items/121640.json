	"_sText": "Hello,\r\n  This is an update to the map surf_antimatter. I replaced all of the textures with Nyro's dev textures. After I saw a version that Sync made, I was spurred on to retexture the map. The colors are mostly the same so that map has the same aesthetic, but the new textures provide more feedback to the surfer. \r\n\r\n  I believe this is a better version since it does not diminish the original, but enhances it. If you are unaffected by the problems many people had with the original textures, then you will remain unaffected. However, if you felt like the original textures didn't give you enough feedback while surfing, then hopefully this version will solve those problems for you.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to Sync for helping me, FalseLogic for the test server, and Nyro for the textures. Give it a try and tell me what you think. As always, I hope you enjoy it!"
