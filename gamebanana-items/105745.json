	"_sText": "Hey, Kersh here again.\r\n\r\nI'm uploading my 'updated' version of the last map. I'm calling it v2 because the last one was of the final build and it plays completely differently than this updated version. It's the exact same map as the first except for the fact that the map is now longer. I received complaints that the last map was too small and that it needed more length (longcat :)) so I made it longer and tested it out. The gameplay seems to me to be much better now.\r\n\r\nDescription of previous map:\r\n\"Not much to say but this is a pretty small map. It's an aim_ag map but it's recommended for GG. This is the final build of this map (I've done some testing with friends and bots) but I may add more onto it if people like it in a v2 of the map.\"\r\n\r\nNow if I ever do a v3 I'll be adding more onto the map - not changing the map completely by making it bigger.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and please leave constructive criticism. :)"
