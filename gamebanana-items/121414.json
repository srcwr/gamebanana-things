	"_sText": "A very fun to play map, including a variety of indoor and outdoor areas.  The weapon on choice is of course the scout and players are also given Deagles and a grenade too, just to make it that more fun to play by providing more tactics.\r\n\r\nBot's work brilliantly on this map, they are good fun to play against.  Nav file is included.  The map also sports HDR and ambient sounds throughout it.  There is also quite a few custom textures and decal's used, don't rip them out of the BSP, instead ask me for them if you want them.  Everything is BSPZipped as always.  Radar and overview is also included."
