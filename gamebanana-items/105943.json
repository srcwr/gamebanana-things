	"_sText": "The concept of this map was originally from ak-colt (duh) but i added a bit more to it. the distance between the spawned teams are a bit more further away so really have to AIM. There is a bridge going around the map and you can get up on top of the buildings you were not able to get up on in the original ak-colt.\r\n\r\n- This map was made for gamers who like more of a challenge. thats why it is called akm4_pro. ENJOY!"
