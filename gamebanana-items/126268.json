Map has only 1 cp because i made this so fast, so i forgot cps, but i think that doesnt matter as long as the map is this short. </p>\r\n<p>I never thought that this map is going to be uploaded to here but after good feedback i decided to make this map finished. I didnt use any bhop triggers, because those are pretty useless... not my problem if someone wants to walk my map. If you see any kind of bugs tell me.</p>"
