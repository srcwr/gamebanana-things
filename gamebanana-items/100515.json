	"_sText": "This is the first version of cs_tenacity. There will be bugs, there will be newbie techniques. Provide constructive, helpful criticism and help me get better.\r\n\r\ncs_tenacity was a project I began working on once I discovered it would be physically impossible to compile aim_opposition on Normal in VVIS. It was a culmination of interesting concepts that I pooled together into a Complex-Themed Map. Things like controllable Gates, Shutters on Windows, Cameras, and Swining Targets are the sort of things you can expect to find in this map. The 2 lights in the dark corridor were supposed to be dynamic, but they lagged the map badly.\r\n\r\nThis map was made entirely by me, Nexolate. Special Thanks go out to Woo, who taught me the basics of Portalling, and for the inspirational maps he makes. You may not copy, edit or redistribute this Map without my explicit permission.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nEDIT: 32 Player Version released."
