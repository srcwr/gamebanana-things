	"_sText": "Remade version of bhop_focus. Gameplay were unstable so heres another one that isnt as compact.<br><br>**Improvements**<br><br>• Smoother gameplay for speedrunning on both bhop categories<br>• Better lightning such as HDR and fixed dark levels<br>• Teleporters being straight forward<br>• New look with better fitting concrete textures<br>• No bad contrast on bhop pads&nbsp;<br>• Cool particle system to make it more alive<br>• Bonus longer and improved<br>• Player clips above checkpoints should be fixed not to interrupt gameplay<br>• Filesize increased from 101 mb to 62 mb<br><br>The old map were made for the sake of the wall idea, so i thought i could make a decent gameplay into it and it would be fine. This map fits better as a speedrun map but still kept to a difficulty standard with a few obstacles as levels increases.&nbsp;"
