	"_sText": "This is a desert style map created with GunGames in mind (and maybe low grav), this map includes a knife arena accessable through any of the two side doors and this arena will remove the users weapons (all but knife) so the players will have to knife fight, and if the user wishes to re-enter the standard arena they can simply exit the knife arena and they will be put into a gun gallery where they may choose a gun before re-entering the battlefeild\r\n\r\nhope you enjoy this map (this is my first official map lol).\r\n\r\nshady-syler."
