I haven't spent more than 4-5 hours on it so there is still some work to do. Some textures aren't perfectly aligned or final for that matter. Still it is playable and fun.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna Statue is made by Hessi.\r\n\r\nNav file and custom stuff are included in the bsp.\r\n\r\nThanks to the people at <a href=\"http://www.deadmen.co.uk\"><b class=orange>Dead Men Walking</b></a> for testing it so far.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDoc"
