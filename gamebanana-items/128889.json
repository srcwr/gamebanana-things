	"_sText": "The first T or CT that reaches the triforce at the top, will be link. Everyone else will be monsters. The player that becomes link will get teled to the center of a lava and will get a sword. Everyone else will get teled to a different area that has a bunch of red and blue block monsters (red for Ts and blue for CTs). The Ts and CTs will have 10 seconds to pick a monster. If a player in a monster suit touches the player that is link, it will hurt link 10 dmg every half a second. There is a white monster suit on each team, that does 20 dmg every half a second. The player that is link can either knife the monsters, or push them into the lava with the sword.\r\n\r\nThe song is a rock verson of the Gerudo Valley Theme song.\r\n\r\nFIXES\r\n\r\n -Fixed problem where alot of Ts and CTs died when they touched the \"monster\" suit.\r\n -Lowered the damage the \"monsters\" do to \"link\"\r\n -Lowered the speed of the push from \"link's\" sword"
