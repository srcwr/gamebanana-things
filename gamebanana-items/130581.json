	"_sText": "*Update; Well... I would like to say this will be the last update, but as you can see that's been happening for a while now. This update aims to improve the game play of the level by making it easier for humans in certain areas.\r\n\r\n.Gives more time for humans to get into the fort after boat ride.\r\n\r\n.Harder for zombies to cut people off near tram area.\r\n\r\n.Two shotguns added to fort. \r\n\r\n.Made it harder for humans to get onto the boat, this forces humans to be a tad more pro active and move. \r\n\r\n.Lots of little fixes.*\r\n\r\n*Update; ok ok.... This is hopefully going to be the last update. This update fixes all missing sounds and music that did not get adding when I was using Pakrat...*\r\n\r\n*Updated; this update is only for people with more than 62 player servers. All this patch does is increase the number of player spawns to fix problems some servers were having.*\r\n\r\nHi all, this is a big update for Grand Boat Escape. It comes in two versions, day time version set during the day, and night time version set during night time with a little lightening going on in the background. Both night time and day time versions come with the same amount of fixes and optimizations. \r\n\r\nThe main improvement in this update is with the increase of fps. Overall there should be around 100-200 added fps what should smooth out everyone experience during play. There also a whole host of other features and bug fixes that should improve game play but also looks.\r\n\r\nSadly to improve the fps some visuals needed to be toned down but hopefully it will not be too noticeable when you guys are playing online.\r\n\r\n**'Posted on older version, but still applies'**\r\n\r\nThis is Grand Boat Escape, its a massive update that took me a little while to do. It recreates tons of features within this map to improve game play and scenery. Overall, this map has been made to be MUCH harder, I felt that the older version out currently was way too easy and got boring very fast, but that should all change now with the amount of changes that has been added in version 3_6. Hope you guys/girls really like it.\r\n\r\nIf your interested in seeing what the old version looked like, go here: Grand Boat Escape\r\n\r\nAdded Feature List:\r\n\r\n.More routs, this to hopefully give the player more power on witch way they go instead of just straight.\r\n\r\n.Added boxes, they need to be jumped over by humans, but can be instantly be destroyed by zombies touching it. This is to slow the humans down and allow the zombies to catch up.\r\n\r\n.Added douche bag doors, These doors can be permanently closed by a human. Thing is, they don't even block out zombies that well. I added them to block out other humans by slightly faster \"trolly\" individuals forcing the humans to take other routs.\r\n\r\n.Greatly improved end fort, what has multiple layers and a Air Ship at the end that the humans must defend, and many more things.\r\n\r\n.Changed the boat, hopefully will be better than the old one, It also allows the zombies to get in from the water, very hard though.\r\n\r\n.Greatly improved the lighting and effects.\r\n\r\n.3d Sky Box has now be finally added, this makes the map look much more larger.\r\n\r\n.A lot of optimization has been done, to make way for all the improvements.\r\n\r\n.In-proved sounds/music.\r\n\r\n.and allot more! probably."
