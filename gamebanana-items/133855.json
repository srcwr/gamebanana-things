	"_sText": "This is a super fun map, especially for DM.  The middle area is surrounded by a moat of water and you teleport from your spawn to 5 different locations on the map.  No spawn killing in this map because players cant see where the players spawn from.  It has 3 different levels with ladders from the water to the top.  20 players max, no nav file because of all the teleports and ladders and underwater action."
