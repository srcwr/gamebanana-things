	"_sText": "I started playing gun game for the first time years ago on a server that played mostly custom glass maps.  I've always thought that I had the most fun with gun game during those days, but I thought the one flaw with glass maps was how everyone committed suicide much too often. In Funneltimes, there is no suicide area; instead, players are teleported elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it\r\n\r\n- PrestO\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alternate download mirror: \r\nhttp://www.filehosting.org/file/details/64415/gg_glass_Funneltimes.zip"
