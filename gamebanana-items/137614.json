This had origninaly just started out as an engine test but then soon progressed into a fully functional map. This is a smaller stage than the other WMD maps that proceeded this, as its been requested. So it will run better on smaller servers rather than large 30+ servers as it would get cramped and loose its charm quickly.\r\n\r\nIts been about a month since I started working on this idea and I think I've molded it as best as I can for the first forray into this style of maps, and I will be creating a few more over the next few weeks to get them out there and onto some servers. They will still have extra little things in them with my own style of course, I still dread the day where I snap and make a simple 6 block map lol, but I'll still have some interesting ones out in the next little while so keep and eye out for them and see any WIP through Half Life Storm Studios of course and what the rest of them are doing as well.\r\n\r\nFeel free to vote HLS mapping studio of the month again :D\r\n\r\nLastly, I'd recommend taking a look over at A.Werner's map done in my same style but re-mixed so to speak. I quite like how he took the basic idea I've presented here and added his own style.
