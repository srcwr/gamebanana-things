	"_sText": "I've worked non-stop all day yesterday and today to fix up this map and make it as fun as possible. This map is called breakable hellhole for a reason. Almost 80% of the brushes are either physboxes (meaning they can move) or breakable. This map requires the skill to snipe with the scout, awp, or autosnipers (if you can get to them). Or if you decide to somehow get close enough to the enemy, whip out a nade or deagle. \r\n\r\n<fieldset><u><b>Change Log</b></u>\r\n\r\n<b>Added</b>\r\n\r\n-Added More obstacles\r\n-Added Physboxes\r\n-Added Deagles and grenades in the middle\r\n-Added ammo to the Scouts and Awps\r\n\r\n<b>Fixes / Changes</b>\r\n\r\n-Optimized\r\n-Fixed Cubemaps\r\n-Improved Lighting\r\n-Fixed texture tiling \r\n-Changed textures of almost everything\r\n-Fixed the breakable objects acting as glass\r\n-Fixed Mis-Aligned textures\r\n-Added displacements to riverbed\r\n-Expanded kill triggers\r\n-Fixed Breakable brushes health for better gameplay.\r\n-Fixed basically everything</fieldset>\r\n\r\nThis map is a lot of fun with online players (but not bots!!)
