	"_sText": "I did a few maps of azdu, this is a remake of the first azdu map I created a long time ago, after playing a lot of zombie mod I saw the most liked maps were the ones which were full of action so I made a map which isnt that big, which is easy to run around and where everything is on one level.\r\n\r\nI created it to be balanced, is more as hunting map rather then a campfest and I try to make my maps slighty off balanced in favour of zombies as its zombie mod and not ct mod.\r\n\r\nIt's really for 50 players but there is 64 spawns.\r\nRun from Ati 5670 and I get good fps so I think it should be playable for all, even those with quite low speced pc's."
