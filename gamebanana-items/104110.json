	"_sText": "\"A map I started on at Xmas. Work on it has pretty much ground to a halt since I started my new job so I thought I would post up as far as I got.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nSoundscape & point sound problems.\r\nNot properly optimised.\r\nSketchy texturing.\r\nModels ain't all that either.\r\nDisplacements are a bit blocky.\r\n\r\nC&C welcome. I am interested in whether people think the map is balanced, if there is enough cover, good lines of sight, too sniper dominated etc. "
