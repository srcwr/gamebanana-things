	"_sText": "A deathrun map with over 17traps. It's fun for both T's and  CT's. It's simple looking and all in one direction :)\r\n\r\nIt includes over 17 traps and has 2 secret grenade spots. A maximum of 37 players can play it, 35CT and 2CT spawns.\r\n\r\nI tried to include as many trap designs as possible, such as moving blocks, lasers, steam, breaking, spikes-whatever... =D At the end teleport you're self at the T zone and \"bang, bang\" kill him.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it and please comment for any bugs, fixes or suggestions for newer versions. To install the map just put the new cstrike folder in the download over the old one and overwrite.\r\n\r\nHappy deathrun!"
