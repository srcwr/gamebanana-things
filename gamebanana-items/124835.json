	"_sText": "Pretty challenging map, very technical and very difficult seeing as how it was originally a Quake 3 DeFRaG map for DeFRaG World Cup 2017. This is round 2 of that world cup. I have added just 1 actually bunny hop block to aid in movement, but other than that it's pretty decent. One of the triggers is busted but I find it really doesn't hinder gameplay very much. I've had to replace or remix a majority of textures, and the ones I replaced just used Saspatoon's glass textures or a brick texture by TopHattWaffle. Most of the original textures are where they are, though.<br><br>I have yet to find somebody get a faster time than 1 minute 20 seconds, so good luck!"
