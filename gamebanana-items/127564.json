Hes texture pack is totally approved and if you compare these to originals, you will notice some differences. If in ur opinion their too similar with originals, complain to him rather than me. And models are made with hammer addon called propper. it will compile brushes into models. Obviously map`s been inspirated by portal and i dont need you to tell me that^^\r\n\r\nHopefully Authors are listed \"right\" way this time^^ but just what is big difference if they are listed in text with links?^^\r\n\r\nEDIT;\r\nMap updated. fixed some critical bugs and added one chamber."
