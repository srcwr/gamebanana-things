The marbles go fast on my track (the double chevrons are boosts) so there's some luck involved in getting the marbles through the course.  80% of the time they make it but sometimes one will fall off.  Just restart in this case.\r\n\r\nUmm I don't have a video for this.  FRAPS is stupid and won't record with a high enough framerate.  If someone could help me out with a video I'd be much obliged.  All custom stuff is paked into the map.</font>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"350\" height=\"310\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hgtvWrqSTAo&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/hgtvWrqSTAo&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"350\" height=\"310\"></embed></object>"
