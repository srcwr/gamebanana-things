You have to make it to the top without dieing from a rock falling down on you. If you make it, you can get weapons and go through a teleporter and get a grenade with a crown stapped to it. You can push a button to kill the people below, kill them with your weapon, or wait and see if they die from the rocks!\r\n\r\n---\r\nEDIT: (v2) declined the rate of crashing"
