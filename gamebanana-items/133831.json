He's gone behind my glowing back and made realistic maps, maps with \"skyboxes\" and \"suns\" and \"details\" *GASP* OH THE HORROR. \r\n\r\nI'VE HAD IT! WE'RE THROUGH. I'll patch my broken heart with Band-Aids if I have to, you've hurt me for the last time! \r\n\r\nThis map includes NO NEON. NONE. WHATSOEVER. It has a custom skybox, how much further from neon can you get?\r\n\r\nYou might notice that my smooth style still came through a little. Not my fault. I'm just too good. \r\n\r\nYOU CHEATING WHORE, YOU!"
