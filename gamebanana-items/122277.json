	"_sText": "Teeth: This map takes the idea of Surf_skyworld_unlimited and applies it to every dimension. This map was kind of a test run of the idea and has some bugs. I'm going to release a DM version soon (HOLD YOUR PANTS ON PAPER-CUT).\r\nThis map will require tons of strategy as you can attack from any angle at all, so keep your guard up! It's good to note that you never leave the same sector, as you simply teleport back to the other side when you go to the next one. This means that jumping off the bottom will have you attacking from the top. WHEN YOU DIE HERE YOU DIE IN RL. This map is Xbox, maybe even ps3, hueg (27 megabytes) so if you want this baby, you need fast dl. I know, I know, but to create a decent effect we needed to have many copies in the skybox, making a small map enormous. Decent fps, though.\r\n\r\nRoosta: The design is based off of surf_elk_boost, created by +ELK+ stpwned, and as such we wish to thank him for the design. To those of you who wonder about the name, don't. You wouldn't understand t (especially so if you are a civil engineer). It both sounds cool and means something, but just worry about the sounds cool part.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nKarateKaefer for the custom skybox\r\n"
