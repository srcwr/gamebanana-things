Though it doesn't seems easy to humiliate someone in this map, when you play it, you will see that it will be much easier that what you thought. This is because the colours of the cars and the amount of cars there are confuse you in a way you get unprotected to those who want to humiliate someone to finish the map or just to steal a level.\r\nThe map has a great amount of camping places, as there are so many car windows avaiable to shoot through. Sniping will be easy up on the trucks, but it might confuse you on the ground, as there are so many cars on front of you.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy playing in this map!\r\n\r\n\r\n[NEW VERSION - CLICK HERE!](http://www.gamebanana.com/cssgg/maps/165492 \"New version - CLICK HERE!\")"
