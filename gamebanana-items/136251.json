If you really want the radar version you can ask me cause I have it on my computer ;)\r\n\r\n<b class=red>The map includes:\r\n- Custom textures\r\n- Custom skybox\r\n- 64 +, total spawn points\r\n- rainbows ^^\r\n</b>\r\nand of course I made a video for this as well ^^\r\n\r\nCheck it out here, and it's in HD ^^\r\n and subscribe to my youtube account if you will ^^\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"295\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fhtnd-YIBdo&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fhtnd-YIBdo&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"350\" height=\"225\"></embed></object>\r\nEnjoy and have fun!"
