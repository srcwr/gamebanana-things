	"_sText": "This is another smash map to go along my collection of smash maps I have created. This time I have tried to test the limits of the physics engine and push it right to it's edge.<br><br>I have tried a new technique of making smash maps by making the smash blocks come out of all 4 corners of the map, which allows for a hefty amount of structures in the middle.<br><br>This map isn't recommended to be played on a listen server as it can produce a little bit of lag, but not much. I recommend you host this on a seperate server as you'll get the most enjoyable experience that way."
