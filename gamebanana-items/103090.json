	"_sText": "This map is based around an arabian highway.  I originally got the idea off a scene in the movie \"JarHead\" and decided to replicate it here.  Basically this is a highway with lots of abandoned cars and vehicles.  \r\n\r\nThe map supports up to 64 players but is recommended for 32 and below.  The map does have fog in it but don't worry it won't cause you any fps lag.  If anything it'll help with fps.  There are 2 bomb sites.  1 int he middle of the map and 1 across the highway from CT Spawn.  \r\n\r\nHave fun and good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate all feedback!"
