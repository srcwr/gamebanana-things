	"_sText": "This map is of small size and supports up to 32 players.  Note, this is not a good map for bots.  The map is a knife only map that encourages arena style combat.  Each player starts in a cage, with 1 cage on each side opening every 5 seconds.  All 32 cages are opened 1 minute 20 seconds into the match.  The map also has gravity lifts for mid air knife combat.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\nA special thanks to the following folks from FPSBanana -\r\n\r\nSmurfii - For making a wonderful gravity lift.\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1885\r\n6piece - For his cellshaded box.\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/793\r\nBarry_Scott - For his detailed marble stairs.\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/927"
