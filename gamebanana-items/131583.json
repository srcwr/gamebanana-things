	"_sText": "Note:\r\nThis map is created for Gun Reloading Zombie Mod and also CSS Deathmatch.  This is not a barricade type of zombie map, it is made to be realistic with high detail.  My goal was to create a realistic zombie lake map since all the other I've seen are poorly made.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nThe map is centered around a large lake in the middle with houses on either side.  There is also a sewer system that connects the two houses with plenty of quick exits.  The map has great creepy characteristics great for zombie invasions.\r\n\r\nFinal:\r\nI do plan on creating more versions of this map to include better optimization, soundscapes, and different game type compatibilities.  Also I am working on creating a Hondo inspired version, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThis is my first published map and I would greatly appreciate input.\r\nMy email is: rapidcore85@gmail.com\r\nMy Steam Name is: enano_salvaje\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading my map!\r\n\r\nenano_salvaje"
