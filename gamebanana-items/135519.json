It has some cool features in it such as a laser trap and a low gravity room.  Buyzones have been included.  Counter-terrorists start on the roof while the terrorists start in one of the rooms in the lab.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to find a bug or error let me know either through this site or on xfire (mistophlies). \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it."
