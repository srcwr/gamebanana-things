	"_sText": "This is a map which I first encountered at least a year ago. I started playing on a fun maps server, run by ZionLan (http://www.zionlan.net). I played there for about 3 weeks straight before returning to my regular servers. This was one of my favorite maps on that server.\r\n\r\nIt's a remake of cs_deagle5, with some original twists like crates that can be broken to walk through them, and Deagle dispensing soda machines. \r\n\r\nAll credit goes to KillBillyÂ² for making this map, I'm just submitting it here for others to enjoy, since it has become a kind of hard to get map. It's on my clan's custom map server though, drop by anytime you like at the following IP:\r\n\r\n82.94.220.42:27015"
