It's rarity and value caused companies to begin tearing down all the aztec ruins and completely reshaping the landscapes, digging up and mining as much of the mineral as the could out of the earth. Instead of towering aztec temples, now there are just warehouses and industrial buildings used to store and purify the minerals. Now ecoterrorits are coming to end this massacre of the land.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n=========\r\n- A whole new detailed vision of de_aztec\r\n- Completely redone textures/bsp\r\n- Added new paths\r\n- Different environmental feel and look\r\n- Textures from TopHattWaffle and a amazing skybox created by Hip Shot and converted to CSS by Burnfingers\r\n- A custom overview/radar\r\n\r\nCreated entirely by hand!\r\n=========================\r\n (metaphorically speaking)\r\nI only copied over the floor sizes in de_aztec and worked from there. The 3D skybox was also copied over."
