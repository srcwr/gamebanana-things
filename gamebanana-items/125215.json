	"_sText": "I wanted to create something new with this map. So I created a story and made levels with new styles of gameplay. All textures are standard or made by myself. Same thing with the sounds.\r\n\r\nI tried to mix up multiple gamestyles. You will find levels which are made for control or speed or climbbhop or xc or sliding and so on.\r\n\r\nMap is medium to pro skill. But it's not a speedrun map. The story is more important than a speedrun. Enjoy the map and dont rush through it.\r\n\r\nI hope you have fun with it!\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe :)\r\n\r\nDotty"
