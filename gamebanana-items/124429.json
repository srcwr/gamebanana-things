	"_sText": "Short and fairly easy bhop map which concentrates on scenery and detail whilst giving you an enjoyable gameplay experience. Nothing I tried too hard on, it's still \"just\" a bhop map, but I hope you like playing it! Some parts of the skybox mess up and display parts of the map you are not supposed to see, but you won't even notice it unless trying to.\r\n\r\nThe map contains custom textures but I had to delete the nature soundscapes due to an unknown problem with the wave file. They were supposed to contain tropic jungle sounds and cute birds but since they didn't work I is cri :'(\r\n\r\nAlso Gamebanana doesn't like reuploads so the .rar file is named bhop_ancient_3 because of me reuploading it. The map file inside will be the same for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe bonus can be placed on top of the wide stone pillar next to the wooden pegs you can see in the 5th screenshot. This spot is accessible. Or just come up with your own bonus.\r\n\r\nPossible on scroll\r\n\r\n!Be sure to leave feedback below so I can further improve my maps or make a fixed version of this one!"
