I posted the v2 of this \"gg_complex_winterconcrete_v2\" a while ago, didnt see very good reviews on it.\r\n\r\nso... i added a few different textures to each section of the map. fixed lighting, now the map appears alot darker, it has some pich black corners that might be fun with enough people.\r\n\r\nIt was made as a gg map, but there are Buy Zones if your server is not running a gg mod.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about it... im really trying to grow and learn more about hammer. This is my First Remake (other than my v2)\r\n\r\n-Mako\r\n\r\n\"visit my v2 :: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/21162\""
