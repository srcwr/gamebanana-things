I then decided to use it as a prefab in other map creations of mine, so I might as well let others use it so they don't decompile my maps :P\r\n\r\nThe building is unaccessible, there is no back, only front, so I recommend you place this somewhere in your map, where the player will not be able to access or see the back of it.\r\n\r\nModify & use this as you wish."
