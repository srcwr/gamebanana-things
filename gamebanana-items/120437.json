I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nTry to land in one of the three pools, one of the three cloth canopies (middle) or the well to survive the jump. Down in each of the houses is one teleporter to quickly return to the top.\r\n\r\nThis map is for max. 30 Players !\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Zip-file includes two versions:\r\n\r\nde dustjump       - AWP and auto sniper are disabled.\r\n\r\nde dustjump all   - All weapons can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise both versions are exactly the same (v 1.2).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map was created by: second ich\r\n2010\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUnpack the Zip-file and move the file \"de dustjump\" or \"de dustjump all\" (or both) to:\r\n\r\nSteam/SteamApps/\"your name\"/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps\r\n\r\nHave fun"
