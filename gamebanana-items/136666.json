There's a lot of cover in the middle and in the place between the houses... I hope i have balanced this map well, so this was what i was most of the time working on, excpect of adding some detail around and getting the custom textures work... So hope you will enjoy playing this map!</b><br>\r\n\r\n<b class=red>Credits:\r\n-offroad</b><br>\r\n\r\n<b class=blue>Installation:\r\ncopy the file to maps in counterstrike source/cstrike\r\nexample:\r\nx:\\program files\\steam\\steamapps\\yourusername\\counterstrike source\\cstrike\\maps</b><br>\r\n\r\n<b class=green>See my other maps <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/maps/449116\">here</a> </b><br>"
