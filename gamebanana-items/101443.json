It has been thoroughly play tested through 9 beta versions and is a favorite on our server. This map is best suited for 16-20 players. Game play is excellent. We have found this to be one of the most even maps available. It usually starts with either side winning 4-5 straight rounds, and then the other team makes a comeback. Tonight I added up the stats on our server and 720 rounds were played, and 360 were won by the T’s and 360 were won by CT’s. Please give it a try, you won’t be sorry.\" [Kas]\r\n\r\nCreated by dF|novalin / Brian Riggsbee\r\n\r\nEmail: novalin@gmail.com\r\n\r\nWeb: www.dangerforce.com\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/9zDFknN4BP8&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/9zDFknN4BP8&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n"
