I made this because i always got shot in my head and wanted a way of training myself. This was great help for me and could be great help for you if your not that great at sniping. This is not proly made.. I just took all the skills of making maps I know and put it to this map. The big hills are not that good because i don't know how to make them good. Just hope you like this map.\r\n\r\n~ Extra\r\n\r\n~ [Put Money to $99999999 to buy sniper or steal from shelf]\r\n~ [Shop Time: Put what you wish but if you run out of ammo, just put the shop time to 999]\r\n\r\nThank you and have Fun!\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know this easter egg, read more..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster Egg:\r\n\r\nNot the best Easter egg but you can shoot the gun from above the shop if you wish not to buy the items.. This is not the best Easter egg, but I didn't really want to make one :P"
