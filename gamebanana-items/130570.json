Marines have the safety of numbers, well stocked ammo and teamwork, where as the Predators must use their cunning and stealth abilities to kill the marines.\r\n\r\n**Where do I get the mod?**\r\n===========================\r\nI am aware that there are not many versions of the mod available in the source mod world, but I have scripted up my own version with a lot of customize-able options for admins. If you would like to download this mod, please visit [THE MOD DOWNLOAD PAGE](http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/hideexecmvp \"\") to do so."
