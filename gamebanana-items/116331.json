	"_sText": "This is my land conversion and major update of my original glass_villafinal.  It's no longer symmetrical, and I've made sure it's optimized to its fullest.  I've included many props to make it more realistic, and done what I can to create variety.  The house has three rooms and two entrances to the main level.  A door can be broken to get into the basement, or you can go down one of the two ladders on the main floor (one at the bottom of the tower, one behind the bar).  There is also a secret tunnel, but you'll have to find it yourself.  The ivy on the tower can be climbed to get to the roof, as can the ivy along the eaves above the parlor balcony and the hedge maze.  The only other way to get up to the roof is by the crates at the Terrorist spawn.  The Terrorist team spawns on either side of the building, while the Counter-Terrorists spawn in the small cluster of trees at the bottom of the hill leading to the villa.  No bomb site, no hostages; the only way to win is to defeat the opposing team.  Have fun."
