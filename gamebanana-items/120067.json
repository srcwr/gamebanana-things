	"_sText": "This map materialized out of me just loading up Hammer and messing around with a simple arena layout. Before I knew it I had a very detailed map forming in front of me. Eventually I ended up with what you see here. I did this map start to finish in about 4 days. There is still a lot of touching up I need to do, and a few bugs that still need to be ironed out, but this is mostly complete. If you enjoy this, please keep an eye out for the final version that will be submitted within the next couple of days. If you have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to let me hear them.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple death match arena meant for the Gun Game mod.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
