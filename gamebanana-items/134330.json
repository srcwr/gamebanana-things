This has also been done with the approval of the original author!\r\n\r\nBasically it is a smaller version of the original map with 2 new features:\r\n\r\n- Glass (unbreakable) windows on top floor for anti-camp.\r\n- Breakable rock at the sides, making it possible to sculpt your own windows.\r\n\r\nI hope this won't raise angry eyes, because once again: it has been done with the approval of the original author (and the credits still remain in the custom texture display)"
