My clan enjoys it thoroughly!\r\n\r\nI want to add ambient sound and perhaps some wind to the final.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nNav file not included as bots tend to.. get confused.. I will, however, create a full nav mesh\r\nfor the final release.\r\nSome textures seem stretched, they are. I will fix all that if I know people are using it."
