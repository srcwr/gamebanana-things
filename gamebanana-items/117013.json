Basically you can play it as a fun little deathmatch type map.\r\n\r\nHave fun exploring. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit:\r\nKomaokc for the skybox \"sky08\" -> see his profile on gamebanana, his skyboxes are incredible.\r\n\r\nTopHATTwaffle for the waterfall texture -> he has a bunch of interesting running water\r\ntextures: http://gamebanana.com/css/textures/2665\r\n\r\nThanks to: Grim, Blitz, Ant, PB, Strider, RabidMonkey and anyone else who commented or gave critiques about the map.\r\nCheers all,"
