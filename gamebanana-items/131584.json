	"_sText": "zm_courtyard is the latest zombiemod map for CS:S made by Marioâ„¢ and me. \r\n\r\nIt features an old building with its courtyard, hence the name. Although it is an small map, and is therefore intended for an small amount of players, it has 64 spawnpoints, 32 for each team.\r\n\r\nIts main features are:\r\n\r\n- Small sized map, perfect for quick zombie matches.\r\n- Climbing spots(box and ladder-based)\r\n- 5 rooms intended for barricade\r\n- 2 bathrooms originally planned as barricade spots but turned into hiding spots\r\n- Detailed and realistic recreation of an old building.\r\n- 3d skybox resembling a medium-sized city by a lake\r\n- The radio in one of the rooms plays Metallica - For Whom The Bell Tolls"
