And if you can't beat it, don't comment on the stages you couldn't beat.\n\nThere a tons of secrets in the map, some are grenades stashed around. One secret bonus, and one bonus is available from spawn.\n\nJail version is coming, if there are any issues just report them to me through steam, ss or gamebanana.\n\nThanks a lot to Tilt and Junior for both the awesome bonuses!\n\nThanks to all of those who beta tested it for me!!\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan S for helping me with some ramp issues!\n\nI appreciate it!\n\nINFO:\n\n5 stages, 2 bonuses\nNo timer\nNo Jail\nDifficulty 1-7 = 4,5 \nLightmapscale: 48, 128 on less visible faces.\nMax percentages used: 67,8% brushsides.\nTime spent: 2 months."
