The space between the CT and T spawn\r\nis very short but, if you rush down via the ladders, there can be quite an intense battle on solid ground.\r\nI placed loads of boxes for some cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nI played this with 20 bots, and i must say, it's pretty intense on the bridge.\r\nIt's quite fun, so i hope you guys'll like it. :D"
