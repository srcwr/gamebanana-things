The map features adventuristic atmosphere throughout easy to medium difficulty bhops. While map is big it should keep you busy for quite some time, as it features better achievement concept. It should be possible for large variety of players to finish the map.<br><br>Map Features<br><br><ul><li>Very big world</li><li>Variety of different bunny hop concepts</li><li>Decent difficulty scale</li><li>Puzzles</li><li>Most content is custom</li><li>Achievement system</li><li>Unique mini-game</li><li>Special rewards</li><li>Custom soundscapes</li></ul>Extra Notes<br>My hopes are that you will enjoy playing this map as much as I enjoyed making it. The v2 update took total of 2 weeks full time development. Enjoy"
