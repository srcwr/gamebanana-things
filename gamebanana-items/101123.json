Its basically finished, the only problems with it are minor graphical problems that shouldn't effect game-play and should not cause distractions.\r\n\r\nI probably wont be working on this map, as I have shifted my gears toward TF2.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a secret in this map. Its generally impossible to find without decompiling it, so here is how to activate it.\r\n\r\n/asshole mode on\r\n\r\nActually, find it yourself. When you find the first secret, that isn't the only one, nor is it the big secret.\r\n\r\nAnd when you find it, the thing in the water is supposed to kill you. It is unkillable, unlike the other ones.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes your curious about the map and it's secrets.\r\n\r\nHave fun :)"
