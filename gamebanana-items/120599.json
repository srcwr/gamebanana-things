There are a couple of secrets, though minor, and a little.... \"puzzle\" to get to the AUG and Kreig 552. \r\nPlease review this, and add to your map rotation. There is only one minor flaw - I used a custom ragdoll from ZM. To people who have not downloaded the lextlionis(?) ZM file, it will show up checkered. My apologies. Alas, this is only a minor thing.\r\nVT... happened as I was making this map. In honor of  VT victims, families, and survivors, I dedicate this to you.\r\nThank you.\r\n~Hobbes312"
