Thanks to uberkirsche for the rotating disco light prefab, and thanks to Dirge for building advice. \r\n\r\nThe fps is not great on this map but I have tried to improve it as much as possible by applying the no-draw texture to every brush side that cannot be seen, and then turning most of the brushes into func_detail. I don't know what else I can do."
