	"_sText": "Hope you like it. A lot of improvements! Check out the change log.\r\n\r\n\r\nA joint operation flight, destined for an assault on a drug lord in southern Colombia, has experienced engine failure and has crashed 94 miles north from the LZ. They are currently making their way south to try to continue the mission. The area is too hot for a extraction and a brief skirmish is expected in a canyon they entered 30 minutes ago. The area is moderatly forested and has an abundance of water and tiny streams that sometimes lead into the mountain sides.\r\n\r\n<b>Change Log:</b>\r\n\r\n-Fixed Cubemaps\r\n-Made canyon wall displacements smoother\r\n-Made the cave look smoother and rounder\r\n-Optimized the map to perform slightly faster\r\n-Changed grass, water, mud textures\r\n-Added Fog\r\n-Changed boulders in river to match canyon walls\r\n-Fixed minor leaks\r\n-And other minor almost un-noticeable changes\r\n\r\nHope you like the changes :D\r\n\r\n"
