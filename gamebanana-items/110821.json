	"_sText": "A remake of the old he_tennis, but mixed with another favorite map, BREAKFLOOR woooop woop!\r\n\r\ntunnel to the other side of the tennis court to avoid those pesky grenades, but watch out, they may roll down! the blocks are just tall enough so that you cannot jump it alone, you need a partner or you can also use a barrel! the invisible ladder from the original tennis map is still there and i added another bonus for one of the teams, it's a bit unfair but if you use the secret area in the picture, you are at high risk of getting a grenade tossed in there with you so watch out!\r\n\r\ni'd like to give credit to the makers of the original he_tennis and breakfloor. thanks for two great maps!"
