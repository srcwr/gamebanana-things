	"_sText": "This is my first map, and I enjoyed learning hammer. \r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it on multiplayer or anything, but if the map is, I'll give thanks for it, and update the page.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to have both teams go up to the top, and defuse/plant the bomb. Or kill each other.\r\n\r\nIt's fairly simple, but I think the whole idea is pretty good, so i will feel great if another map of this type is released.\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't include HDR because it makes the world model have radioactive fungal infections in the fingernails, and made the gun luminescent. It's just creepy."
