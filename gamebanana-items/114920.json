Do I care what you think? ;D\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\r\n-\r\n-buy zone is the middle island, just like you would expect for an fy map ;D.\r\n-all players spawn with a knife only, then you can pick up guns on the islands\r\n-in the beginning of each round, it may lag because the weapons fall from the air all together - but after those 2 seconds (approx) it won't lag anymore. \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATED VERSION HAS BEEN UPLOAD. SAME NAME. \r\n\r\nchanges :\r\n\r\n-balanced T's weapon spawn\r\n-deleted awp and auto gayer."
