	"_sText": "The scenerio of the map is there are 5 terrorists that have fortified them selves inside a run down building, and are holding 3 hostages. There are 20 counter terrorists making an assault.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the map is that 5 human players are on the T side, while 20 CT bots assault the 5 human players. While human players could play on both sides, it was intended for the use i stated above.\r\n\r\nThis is the first public version, the hostages do not move, and there are a few weird lights/ bugs.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n-undertone"
