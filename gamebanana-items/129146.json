	"_sText": "Hello everyone\r\n\r\nThis is a a 60-70% completetion preveiw of my map \"Delirium\"\r\nIt is 100% playable with the exception of a few basic jailbreak elements ie: The weapons in the cells.\r\n\r\nYou can see my video log here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/shinoteseu\r\n\r\nAnd the feedback Forums here:\r\nhttp://www.xtremejailbreak.com.au/home/forums/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=3012&start=0\r\nhttp://www.xtremejailbreak.com.au/home/forums/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=2963\r\n\r\nIf you have any strong experience in mapping and wish to contribute where possible then add my steam account: Shinoteseu\r\n\r\nPlease don't add my steam account to give feedback.\r\n\r\nThis version contains the following:\r\n\r\n95% finished gunroom\r\n90% finished pool (known as the grotto)\r\n100% finished kitchen and mess hall (may go back and add anyway)\r\n95% finished deagle toss.\r\n95% finished Time attack\r\n100% finished sewers\r\n80% finished cells\r\n65% finished main room\r\n\r\nThese are just gauged statistcs though\r\nI may alter things as i see fit.\r\n\r\nI still have 2 rooms to go and then i need to build 2 vent systems, and then possibly a series of walkways to intergrate the rooms. Thanks to the underground theme of the map i have no real horizontal or vertical limitations. And by limitations i mean i don't need to add visual explainations to the size of the prison.\r\n\r\nOther than that detail and decals can't hurt anything.\r\n\r\nThis map will quite hopefully be exclusive to the Xtreme jailbreak servers in australia, I don't mind the preveiw versions being used on minor servers since i plan to make the full version something that no other preveiw version will have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
