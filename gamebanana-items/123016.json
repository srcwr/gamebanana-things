	"_sText": "Thank you for being here to review my newest release, Surf Sniper. In this map, I wanted to explore HDR lighting, logic timers, tracktrains, rope functions, and foilage. I think it turned out alright, all things considered.\r\nThe map itself takes place in a jungle-y aspect. It is rather small, but due to the final HDR lighting and the sun, it may take some time. Again, with most of my maps, just look for the 3-1-2 for secret buttons and goodies.\r\n\r\nThe jail itself is one of my finest masterpieces. I littered the ground with leaf decals, placed a few trees, added a rope, and added some shrubbery for those secret sniper spots. At each five minute interval, the jail will become a kill zone, so it's advised not to fall. Yes, the SG550 and the rope is the escape out.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you have fun. \r\n~ Hobbes312"
