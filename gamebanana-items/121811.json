	"_sText": "This map, surf_castle2 is the sequel to my first surf map ever, surf_castle. It is a medium sized combat map. Your starting weapons are knifes, deagles, and shottys. There is an awp on top of the tower and there are hidden paras in the sewer things. There is a bomb site and a bomb in the tower so if you want you can plant two bombs. The map is HDR and the skybox is custom. I just thought this map deserved better than the first one. The game play goes as follows, you get shot out of the spawn with pushes and then you surf on this oval ramp with arrows that make you go faster. There is a ramp going down the middle of the map also. Enjoy!"
