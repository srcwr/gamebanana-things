	"_sText": "This is a fun map made by Erawr. Since fusion is a 24/7 breakfloor clan he named it fusionbreak2k7 and made it somewhat like breakfloor. If you break all blocks under you you go into water and it gives about 3 per second. Go into the door and select the right path. Includes : death trap, 2 teleportation rays, and one door that can lead you to a bomb shelter. Have fun\r\n\r\nNO SCREENSHOTS BECAUSE FPS BANANA GAVE THE MESSAGE:  Screenshot was 640 pixels too thin and 480 pixels too short  . \r\n\r\n Trust me, the map is awesome"
