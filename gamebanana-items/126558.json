	"_sText": "Is_Curve\r\n\r\nMap by <b>Apexi</b>\r\n\r\nSkybox by <b>Karatekafer</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Background:</b>An ice skating map inspired by Jack The Stripper's Is_Jump. Note it is 100% made my me except the skybox. This is not a rip or copy from any map what so ever. Each team spawns in a dome-like room and in the middle there is a Gravity lift. There is two ways to get up to the top. The gravity lift or the teleport in spawn. Call it a race if you wish to get to the shotguns.\r\n\r\n<b>Warning:</b> Do not copy ANYTHING from this map without proper credits or permission. Do not decompile this map and take something from it. If you do you will be hunted down!\r\n\r\nCustom red glass texture by me. Interested in using it? Message me.\r\n\r\nWant to see more maps like this? Visit Mapjunkies.com and add us to your watchlist!\r\n\r\nEnjoy"
