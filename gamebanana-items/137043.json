	"_sText": "One of my first proper maps. I've made some before but they've never been final versions or very good. This is the first map I've submitted too.\r\n\r\nNote: The map MAY be a bit dark. I never have any problems with the lighting on my maps but some people seem to have an issue with them not being light enough, but most people find them Ok though so it probably won't be an issue. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\nThe map is a primarily for gun game... it has 24 player slots on each team.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nMore maps to come soon :)"
