	"_sText": "Hello guys.\r\nI am releasing my first larger aim_-Map today.\r\nWith aim_pistols_v1 you are able to train your pistol skills in case your primary runs dry.\r\nYou can play on this map with up to 24 players. Perfectly for public servers or big LAN's to warm up. :)\r\n\r\nThe map is full of crates, pillars and other obstacles that make good aim a must. Because of the angle of the sunlight there is alot of shadows on this map that make the flashlight helpful sometimes.\r\nYou can either stay with your starting pistol (USP/Glock) or try your luck with the Deagle and survive the round to get full Deagle ammo next round. -> Good skills will be rewarded!\r\n\r\n**Please leave some constructive criticism and tell me how you find the map and why. :)**\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map! :D"
