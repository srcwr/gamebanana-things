	"_sText": "The object of this map is to break the floor. There is 5 levels of blocks and the 6th level is scattered. The 6th level is stronger than the normal blocks. Theres a way to get on top if you can figure it out. At the bottom is a pit. Above the pit you can stand on the crossing. There is also an Anti-Tker on the opposite side of SHOOT.  Have fun!\r\n---\r\nI recommend 24 people in all. Thats the Maximum players anyway.\r\n---\r\nKnown Bugs\r\nI don't know of any bugs. If you find one just post it here and I'll try to fix it.\r\n---\r\nCredits\r\nTStar made the original breakfloor.\r\nI made breakfloor_texture."
