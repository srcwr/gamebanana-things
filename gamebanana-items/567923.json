	"_sText": "This is my first map. It is a defusal map with two lanes, two unequal spawns, two bombsites and two (non-enterable) windows into A-site. There is a long hall on the right that takes you to B, but allowing you to move to A if you want to. the left tunnel, which I called \"middle\", is shorter and leads to A primarily. B-site has very little cover but not many angles of attack, while A is much larger, has more cover and more angles to hold, peek or be attacked from. The map as a whole is also VERY short and does not allow for much of a break other than freeze times, so always be on the lookout for enemies! I hope you have lots of fun playing this map!"
