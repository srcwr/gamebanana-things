	"_sText": "I've put together de_kerk. It's still in the optimizing/detailing stage.\r\nust showing up the new lighting color/direction/shadows a bit more. (Ignore the texturing error). Also, if you'll notice in all of these shots, those clouds move (thanks to Port for the cloud model). Hopefully that should help with the \"lifeless\" problem a bit.Keep in mind that the CT spawn is new, and thus the 3d skybox around that area doesn't line up.\r\nI've had to rebuild that thing 4 times now and it's a pain in the arse to work in 1/16th scale because barely moving terrain litterally makes mountains out of mole hills. So I want to make sure these spawns are locked down before I go and rebuild that thing again. On the bright side, it has a pretty lake... and a visible skybox texture that I find amusing. "
