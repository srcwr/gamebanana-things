	"_sText": "This is my first zombie map. I made plenty of places for humans to hide/climb on top of. One thing I didn't show in the screenshots is a hidden room in the sewers. I feel this map is pretty balanced (meaning zombs won't dominate every round, and humans won't always kill off all the zombs). I plan on doing some more versions of this map with better lighting effects, more hidig places, etc. Let me know how I did for my first attempt."
