	"_sText": "This is a remake of the classic fy_iceworld map, with a large visual overhaul and minor layout changes: the removal of the rear walls and the narrowing of the side routes. Furthermore, this map supports 64 players (hectic as it might be) and spawns additional weapons to accommodate this large number of players."
