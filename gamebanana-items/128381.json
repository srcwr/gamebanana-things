Theres a couple of very realistic traps, with physics, and all of that shit :D looks pretty good. like collapsing pillars and stuff.\r\n\r\nBut i hope you'll put this map into your servers, and PLEASE comment about if u can think of any changes, or if you find any bugs and stuff.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwkxlmMtuw\r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n"
