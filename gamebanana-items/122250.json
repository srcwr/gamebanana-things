There is a pro room, gun room, 1337 room, jail, and balconies to camp when people fall. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nGun Room: basically has all the guns in it...\r\n\r\nPro Room: Has a camera and a button that kills everyone in the jail.\r\n\r\n1337 Room: Has a monitor with multiple camera views. Has a button to kill everyone in the jail, buttons to capture people and teleport them into a buring cage, and a rave room with trance music and flashing lights.\r\n\r\nSong in Rave Room: DJ Tiesto - Insomnia\r\n\r\nREMEMBER, THIS IS THE BZ2 FILE\r\n\r\nHave Fun!"
