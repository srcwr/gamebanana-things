	"_sText": "Finally, a UNIQUE FY map.\r\n\r\nThis map is based on a game of checkers between 2 busts inside test tubes allegedly \"controlling\" the players.\r\n\r\nEveryone starts with a knife, If you make it to the other side (right up against the wall) you can be \"Kinged\" by buying a weapon but this is by no means easy because you leave yourself exposed while you're buying and after all it's not that easy to get there in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis map is more fun in slow-motion.\r\n\r\nA player can also jump up on some blocks and then on to the balconies where the figures are, in this spot they will find a scout with no spare ammo, this is NOT cheap because it is surprisingly hard to get there and after all it's only 10 shots, in addition someone could get \"kinged\" and render the advantage of the scout useless. But the ledges exist for a better purpouse, they contain a secret switch that opens the door to the armories (although the doors open slowly and by the time they open most will have guns anyway).\r\n\r\nThis map is also almost endlessly amusing with bots, lots and lots of bots."
