	"_sText": "JAIL BREAK<br><br>jb_underground is finally here with version 1! Been working on this project for months now off and on. Finally buckled down and completed as much as I wanted to. A map is never really finished.<br>Map is about 80-90% optimized. It could be optimized more but I don't know much about it. It's my first real map after all. My other two projects were really just learning experiences. <br>The map features games that terrorist can play (with a willing warden) <br>Those games are:<br>Simon says (colors)<br>Pick-a-color (new concept by me)<br>81 square break floor<br>volleyball<br>ice race (climb)<br>death crate<br><br>It also features <br>Secrets<br>Medic<br>Disco<br>Pool<br>A pit (isolation)<br>A secret lambda room that acts as a bomb site that to gain access to you must find 3 secret buttons located throughout the level. Goodluck. (note: if a T drops the bomb the bomb disappears)<br><br>Special thanks to GP's own OhhDandy for his medic prefab.<br><br>"
