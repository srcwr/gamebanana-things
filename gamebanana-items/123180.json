My goal was to make a difficult map while keeping the annoying factor down, which I think I achieved.\r\n\r\nTry to enjoy it, but be warned, it is quite hard.\r\n\r\nDifficulty (determined by beta tester feedback): Tier 6/6\r\n\r\nSurf timer zoning information is included in the zip file.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UCT-FBDF3bE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
