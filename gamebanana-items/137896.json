This is only the fourth map I've ever made, but I am definitely proud of it despite it having a few issues. If there are any major issues please contact me on discord at PrisonNightmare#7061.<br><br>- EDIT -<br><br>There were some things that were fucked up that I wanted to change. A list of what I changed is below:<br><br>- Changed HDR settings so they aren't blindingly bright<br>- Fixed abused skips in the map (fuck you wilkins xd)<br>- Fixed B4 trigger_multiple zones<br>- Added easter egg for friend since apparently he tested the map and I completely forgot about it<br><br>Zones:<br><br>map_startzone<br><br>map_endzone<br><br>bonus1_startzone<br><br>bonus1_endzone<br><br>bonus2_startzone<br><br>bonus2_endzone<br><br>bonus3_startzone<br><br>bonus3_endzone (Just learned that this trigger zone is fucked, would recommend to just zone it manually instead)<br><br>bonus4_startzone<br><br><div class=\"SelectedElement\">bonus4_endzone</div>"
