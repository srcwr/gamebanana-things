The special attention was paid to all numerous stairways.<br><br>Well... bots use all possible ways now and perfectly navigate with all map. Now they are fast, as swift as any arrow! :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted (more detailed and more suitable to environment than in original).<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/147319\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also your responses for me are still important ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:&nbsp; &nbsp;Labmonkey / Bo Laugesen (for castle-themed map)Additional Gratitudes:&nbsp; &nbsp;BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; &nbsp;Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),&nbsp; &nbsp;CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; &nbsp;Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>One touch to the chapel door, how swiftly comes the arrow... ;-)"
