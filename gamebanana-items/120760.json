On the t side, if the button is pressed, a fire alarm sound will be played quickly then all the black squares will drop.  If the ct's button is pressed, a combine alamr sound will be played quickly (and by quickly I mean like 1 second) and then all the white checkers will be dropped.  If you hear both sounds, well, sorry :).  Underneath are rollers, fans, and spikes (and a func_hurt trigger so there is no way to live....).  Yeh, all criticism is open.  This is kind like an fy map as well as a fun map."
