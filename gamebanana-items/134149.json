	"_sText": "A small GG map made for my clan the Christian Crew, though I would be happy to let anyone else use it on their servers. If you would like it to be on your servers I would be more than happy to edit it to your liking (advertisment and such, seeing as I have stuff for CC on this map). \r\n\r\nThere are 4 secret passageways on this map.  It comes with the standard 32 player slots. \r\n\r\nThis map has been said to \"look like a classic\" so I hope you feel the same way and put it on your servers. :D  Thanks Chizbone for doing the NAV file :D\r\n\r\nThere is now a buyzone.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------EDIT-------------\r\n\r\nI had the wrong BSP for it, but now I changed it. So if you DL'ed it and it has errors near the spawn DL it again. Sorry for the inconvenience \r\n\r\n"
