But to pass 100% is real and easy!<br><br>At the beginning of the map, there is a musical accompaniment (BeatBox Sound) with a trigger attached to the player, and the other players that are next to it will hear the sound.<br><br>Also in the end there is a musical accompaniment (Funny BeatBox Sound) with a trigger to the clip and everything is the same as with the 1st version.<br><br>Design and textures on the map look good and will not be nervous.<br><br>The whole map has good lighting, there are no mistakes with textures.<br><br>I want to note that I did a map for 1 day from scratch)<br><br><br>I really hope that you will enjoy playing on my map!<br><br>Have a good game!<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DM3jKrP-PZE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"
