	"_sText": "This map is an update to an earlier version (v4).  It was originally inspired by one of my favorite surf maps, skyscraper, and retains some of that blend of surf and shoot, although this version is a little heavier on the surf.  More ramps, more boosts, and more tricks are available now.  You can land on my name in the sky (and tele from there to an invisible platform or just jump off and surf).  From the orange roof, you should be able to surf/fly directly to anywhere in the map once you get the hang of it.  There's a buy zone, weapons room (no awps/semis in the WR), multiple paths from the spawn (six really), and awps available in the trickier places to get to."
