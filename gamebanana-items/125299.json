I could pass it all, but help me to realize beautiful ideas in real terms thanks to the level tests.&nbsp;<br><br>This map is complicated in ideas, you need to think everything over and learn how to pass. While you can not guess how to get through, then you should not try to pass it for a time from 1 time. It will be difficult for you to pass all levels from 1 time!<br><br>I wish you to go through all the levels for a while as they are. If you need help with the passage, I'm ready to show you how to get through them. Add me to friends in the steam, then I'll be able to help you quickly :)"
