	"_sText": "This map was created from scratch for my Capstone Project. The main concern here was learning how to import models with their textures into the Hammer Editor while creating a simple to follow environment. In the near future I plan on learning how to effectively import leaves into the Hammer Editor to give my trees more life. Without further ado, I present to you gg_ForestCity!\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\n\r\nThis maps takes place near Portland, Oregon which is now a heavily wooded area called Pandemic Forest. The year is 2014 and unfortunately for humanity the Mayans accurately predicted the end of times. Over the past year and a half humanity (or what's left of it) has slowly emerged from their bomb shelters to find devastation. Oregonians are now on the verge of total destruction and must fight through Pandemic Forest to reclaim their city."
