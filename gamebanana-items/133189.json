There are corridors underneath ground, some funny killer doors that ppl hate, and the feeling of having 20 zombies running after you, if you're too slow, ppl close doors on you, trapping you with zombies till you can get doors back open, but only on one door, other door is one way open, but with a vent on the side. There's too much to write about tbh, trust me, the 48 man server its on is almost always full and its even harder to get on when this map is on!"
