	"_sText": "My first crack at a CSS map.  Vietnam like map.\r\n\r\nComes in some diffrent flavors as I figured things out better\r\n\r\nChupong-  was first version.  walls are solid green color and close\r\nto border.  Actually is is very hard to see bots on this.\r\n                                                            good for gungame?\r\n\r\nChupong 2- version has more trees and they are oriented randomly.\r\n           Walls and roof are solid green box.  basic\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nChupong sky-  this version has skybox, but due to my floor mistake,\r\n              the rocks and hills are highest in this one. This version\r\n              has a dark border out in skybox\r\n\r\nChupong sky2- I raised the floor so the hills are lower and\r\n              there are paths between the mounds.  \r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nChupong2sky4- this one is the Chupong 2 version with full,\r\n              un walled outer area.  It is full sky through the\r\n              trees.  White camo is weirdly effective.\r\n\r\nChupong2sky5-  this is same map,  but with the dark green border\r\n               out in the skybox edge.  Looks like dark horizon\r\n               in treeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am including the Silverbirch.rar file as it is custom\r\nstatic prop I used.  I tried to compile map into complete\r\nbsp with pakrat,  but I have no idea what I am doing.\r\nEverything else I think is in a basic install of CSS.\r\n\r\nLighting is basic.  I don't like it shadowy and dark.\r\n\r\nI left logs in so you can see my errors and fix them,\r\nmap runs,  but I do see some errors.\r\n\r\nPlease use this on a server,  but I think it will have \r\nto be compiled with pakrat or some other program.\r\nI could not get it to find or recognize the tree file.\r\n\r\nJigen </;-(>\r\n\r\nCredit to they guy who made the silver birches.  Ida used green trees,\r\nbut I could not figure out how to get them out of certain maps.\r\n\r\n[HG] Custom Gungame!!  Please a version of this on your server!!!\r\nAll servers welcome to use,  but i\"m on HG gungame most of the time!"
