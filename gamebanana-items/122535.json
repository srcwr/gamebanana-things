Basically too many bug fixes and changes for me to possibly remember, the most significant of which being the fact that lighting is now enabled, with the file size being small enough to be dl'd from a server.\r\nVery minor have been made to the actual course, most changes are regarding the end zone and jail.\r\n\r\nChanges regarding the jail:\r\n- Nades and flashes are now provided\r\n- More open\r\n- More secrets\r\n- More controls ;D\r\n\r\nThe endzone has also been improved, and the auto-sniper section removed (or has it ;))\r\n"
