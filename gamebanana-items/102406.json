They made their entrance with explosives. Counter-terrorists have entered the fort as well, in order to prevent any damage events on the monument.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists:\r\nPrevent the terrorists from causing any big damage to the fortifications.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Blow up either the haybale stock or the backyard.\r\n\r\nInfo:\r\nTwo bombsites in the map;\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n3nD_Of_The_Lin3\r\n\r\n-----\"-----\r\n\r\nA medium size map. I believe it was a bit based on several maps, for example:\r\nde_inferno;\r\nde_aztec;\r\nde_cbble;\r\ncs_militia;\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this map is to give you fun times playing Counter-Strike:Source. It gave me a bit of work, so It puts a smile in my face if you post some feedback about it. That will even help me improve my skills, and make a \"de_forge2\" or any other kind of map each time better and better. Rating will also help me see how much effort I should put next time, and how much I need to improve. Thanks for reading.\r\nThank you, Valve!"
