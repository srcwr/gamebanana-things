	"_sText": "So I finally got around to editing and revising this map.  Has some nice new editions, better quality textures, nice lighting.\r\n   This is a medium sized map, but plenty of routes to take in your journey for destruction.  It is very fast paced, like an aim or fy map, and unleashes all the action and fun of having to plant/defuse the bomb under extreme lines of fire.  Suitable for snipers, rogues (rushers), team play, and even fun against bots for home or lan users!"
