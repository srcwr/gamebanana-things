	"_sText": "This map is made for upto 36 players. It is a fairly small map and gameplay on it is extremely fast. It is set up fairly strategically so that neither team has an advantage. \r\n\r\nThere are buy zones places in each team's spawn.\r\n\r\nThere are several sniper points in the map and many areas to rush through and gain control over the map to win the match.\r\n\r\nThe map was tested with bots and, to my suprise, they were able to access every part of the map that any normal person would be able to access. Normally bots get confused and aren't able to get to vertain parts of the map, but they did here. "
