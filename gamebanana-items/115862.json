	"_sText": "This map is one of my first but every one thinks its great. its pretty simple but very cool. it has two physicly semetrical bridges each with a spawn point at the end. if you fall off the sides you teleport from the top of the map and fall to your death(this is realy funny). but all in all just download this map and have fun send it to your freinds if you like it (trust me, you will) and have fun. :D  , lewis k  "
