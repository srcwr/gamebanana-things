	"_sText": "Introducing gg_greek. A simple, symmetrical map suited towards the gungame counter-strike source mod.\r\n\r\nThe map was produced in 2 hours as part of a small mapping competition with a few friends. The theme was \"Temple\", so I went with this iconic greek style. Sorry to those who know, but no, the columns are not tapered.\r\n\r\nThis is the final product, with no changes to the initial 2 hours worth of work.\r\n\r\nThe map plays well, is simple to learn, and is not dominated by any specific type of weapon or playstyle.\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
