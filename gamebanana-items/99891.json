CT are attacking the building from the canal, where they came from with small boats.\r\n\r\nSome things are different to ordinary cs maps: The hostages can be at 5 different places and in the controlroom there is a screen which can be used to see the camera covering the storage-entrance. The exitdoor from the changing-rooms is looked and can only be opened from inside.\r\n\r\n"
