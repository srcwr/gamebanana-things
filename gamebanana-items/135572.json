I have all the download links in the first post of me FP thread: http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?p=15591715\r\nLeave comments here if you can since I don't get email response from FP.\r\nShould any textures not be obtainable I will re-upload them\r\n\r\n** THE REASON I AM NO LONGER WORKING TO FIX THE BSPZIP ISSUES WITH THIS MAP IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VMF AND NON-PACKED BSP ARE GONE! I HAD SUFFERED A HARD DRIVE FAILURE AND THIS IS ONE THING OUT OF 350GB OF LOST DATA. I ONLY HAVE THIS COPY TO WORK WITH **\r\n"
