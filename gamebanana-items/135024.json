In the middle, there is a \"no man's land\", complete with some walls, logs, and boxes. The roofs to both buildings are accessible, and connected by a bridge. Underground, which is accessable from the bunkers, there's a long hallway that can house a small skirmish and two vents on either side that can be used to sneak into the enemy bunker.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've updated this map, as it was one of the first ones I have ever made for the Source engine. I've completely redesigned it and redid most of the map, optimizing it and making it look a lot nicer than it did before. \r\n\r\nPlayers will find they get well over 100FPS, even with 24 players, in-game. I worked hard to ensure this stays true. If the map is running without any players, I get a solid 250FPS or above in 90% of the areas on the map.\r\n\r\nComments, questions, suggestions, and complaints are welcome.\r\nAssessments are welcome as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing and enjoy! =D\r\n\r\nÂ£cho\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative"
