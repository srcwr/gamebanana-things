	"_sText": "About this Map. Compile Time 2hrs Aprox\r\nThe Design\r\n    I designed this map so you can have a decent mall map for zm mod since no one has ever released a good one. I do plan on either making a second floor or making a new map entirely depending on how I feel. If there was 2 be a second floor I wouldn't really know where to put it. Secondly this map is oringally based off my first mall map which was kinda of fail. But never made it 2 css zm it was zombie master.garrys mod. etc map. Only because I missed the good old days of mapping for css. I went back over to the dark side. **About the map** There are Custom Textures with your famous stores. and Restaurant.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nFor the future\r\n[Possible] New extension/Opening to Stores.Such as Bestbuy.Apple.Garden Cafe.\r\n[Possible] Second Floor with More Stores.\r\n[Soon] Different Lighting verision.
