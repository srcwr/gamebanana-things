	"_sText": "This map was originally made by monstergnom, all the credit for layout should go to him.\r\n\r\nRevised version changes:\r\n\r\n*Added lighting, no more full-bright. - I've tried to use the tempreture of the colors to give a special feeling to the map, forethought has gone into how the map is lit.\r\n*Added an out-door recreation zone - The original didn't feel fleshed out enough, so a recreational zone was a good way to flesh it.\r\n*\"Livened\" up the walls.\r\n*Redid the cell block - Due to the ceilings lower, more realistic height, i had to remove the top bank of cells and completly change the arcitecture of the cell block. For example, the VIP cell is no longer detached from the rest of the cells.\r\n*Got rid of unessarcy buttons for opening doors etc etc.\r\n*Removed the steam room and added a control room.\r\n*Completely changed the location of the pool, the old one was cluttered, and a  nightmare for Vvis. so it was best to remove it.\r\n*Retextured alot of the map.\r\n*Completely redid the armory, is larger and contains more guns now.\r\n*Added a small vent from kitchen to the main room.\r\n*Removed the teleporter and replaced it with a USP\r\n*Added some optimiztion to it, areaportals and the like."
