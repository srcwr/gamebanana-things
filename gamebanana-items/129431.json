	"_sText": "This map is a realistic map: have no teleports or false walls.\r\nThe map is based on a big building in the city. That building is a police dept with jails. The playable floors are 4 plus the roof.\r\n\r\nThis jail map have got interactive ducts, football, pool with disco, nursery, jails, isolation jail, kitchen, toilets, and armory. There are some weapons all over the map for the terrorists.\r\n\r\nA lot of escape ways are by the windows. Example: you can jump by the window near the jails an do surf in the oblique roof to reach the pool.\r\n\r\nIn the jails there are 3 smokes, 1 pistol, and 1 hegrenade.\r\n\r\nThe song of the disco is a remix of We No Speak Americano.\r\n\r\nThere are 25 slots for Ts and 24 for CTs.\r\n\r\nHope you like it.\r\n\r\nLeave comments please!"
