The intention is for terrorists to plant the bomb at the bombsite floating underneath the arena by rushing it from their base and counter-terrorists defend. Game follows the basic principles of glasstrap, but with neon lighting (beware of strobe effect) and a bombsite.\r\n\r\nBOTs not supported, they get stuck at the spawn area."
