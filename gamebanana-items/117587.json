	"_sText": "It appears that I only make maps when I'm bored and have absolutely nothing to do..\r\nAnother small map, 6 spawn points for each team. The map is best played with 3 players on each team, also it has a full nav. file so you can play it with bots (they do however love to camp near the spawn points) no radar image though, I still don't know how to do that... I tryed using cubemaps so you won't really see any shadows I think, though the map looks nice and shiny. The screenshots don't show the map's shiny, clean look.\r\n\r\nCan't find any bugs, if you do find any, post a comment or just send me a message.\r\n\r\nAny sugestions about improvements, critics and \"you suck\" comments are welcome, I'm here to learn so, go ahead. If I think there are a few changes needed to be done, I'll try to improve the map. Don't forget to rate ;)\r\n\r\nI don't feel like talking too much so that's about it. \r\n\r\nPS: The map has a little easter egg, have fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/laDIjZtQagI&hl=pt_PT&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/laDIjZtQagI&hl=pt_PT&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[] Nemus Monachus\r\n"
