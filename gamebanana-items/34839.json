It's a completely hand-made and carefully optimized .nav-file (because in original author's release the .nav-file probably was not included).\r\n\r\nThis Navigation Mesh was create from scratch and the most part of the areas was recustomized manually 'cause auto-generated Navigation Mesh was not fully playable. The special attention was paid to paths on the boards thrown over passes and to lifting on a rope ladder.\r\n\r\nWell... bots freely move through all possible ways now. From their stumps the dust literally stands rooted to the ground! :-)\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also you aren't lazy to write about your game impressions.\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Adr1an (for nice balanced and fine designed sequel of immortal maps for CS:S).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nSome other place, some other time... same dust ;-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 18.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Added Place Names;\r\n- Some other minor changes.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
