It was created with the sole purpose of repopulating our hide n seek server with some fresh maps.\r\n\r\nIt is based in a neighbourhood map and any of you Australians will recognize the iconic hardware brand.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of places to hide and I have also linked a prop list you can use as well.\r\n\r\n[Prop List - Click Here](http://dumptext.com/knNtFgIS \"Prop List\")\r\n\r\nEnjoy"
