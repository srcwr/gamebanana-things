	"_sText": "Each team starts out with knifes 1 player per team gets to be the summoner by walking into the S. He sits ontop the tower and presses buttons to call down meteroids on his side of the map to smush people. Each tower has a button for the other team to press that will destroy the enemies tower/summoner and weaken them down to 50 hp. Lots of weird tricks you can do in this map because of the meteroids shockwaves. Scouts will drop in the 2 towers after 2 minutes of gameplay to prevent running/camping.\r\n\r\nSet for up to 48 spawns- Plays best with more people\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here at Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect..\r\n"
