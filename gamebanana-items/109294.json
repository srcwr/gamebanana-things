Didn't take long as the original map was pretty basic, but still fun gameplay wise. I pretty much brought this map back to life for my clan. After using the whole aztec style, I realized that I've always loved de_aztec, and aztec style. Hoping to go further with aztec style maps.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"blue\">Features:</b>\r\n* 3D Skybox\r\n* Rain\r\n* Blended Textures\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Next Steps:</b>\r\nNext step is to hopefully continue with this aztec style, and make some more maps. Also to make some more small maps that are just made for fun. \r\n\r\n<b>And of course, kudos to <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/136682\">VNVNation</a> for the original map + layout. :D\r\n\r\n"
