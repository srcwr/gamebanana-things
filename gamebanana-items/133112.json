It's only in version two, So please feel free to report any bugs here.\r\n\r\nThis map is RACE to the end, try to escape the zombies infection \r\n\r\nHonestly, this map separates the good players, from the bad. This Zombie escape map involves speed running, surfing, climbing, and your brain. Survival of the fittest. The weak will die quick. \r\n\r\nNotes\r\n*Working Tram and Elevator\r\n*Pipe room that floods\r\n*Tons of traps to kill noobs\r\n*Climbing & Surfing skill needed\r\n*RE1 Laser room, Credits for the lasers goto the creator of \"Surf_rebel_resistance2\" Lethalis and Archangel ( My favorite surf map ).\r\n*Explosive traps\r\n*Burning Barricades\r\n*Force fields with buttons to turn on and off\r\n\r\nThanks to my buddy Instant Death for helping fix some problems.\r\n"
