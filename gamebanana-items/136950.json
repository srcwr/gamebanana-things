Also, this was a experimentation in cell-shading.\r\n\r\nPerfect for short range weapons, long range weapons, knifing and hegrenades.\r\n\r\nThis map also has buy-zones for anyone who wishes to have this on any non-gungame server.\r\n\r\nAll textures created by myself.\r\n\r\nSkybox texture credit goes to Karatek√§fer, this is #3 in which I've used your fantastic skytextures.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play this map on our gg server, please join us at:\r\n\r\n208.146.44.32:27015\r\n\r\nor visit us on the fourms:\r\n\r\nhttp://seattle-ducksoup.com/index.php\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n--Manqueef/Emeriastone"
