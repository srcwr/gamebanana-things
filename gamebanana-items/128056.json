Left click with your knife pushes and right click pulls. Very abnormal game play can be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it the more you play the more fun it will get once you learn all the tricks. Enjoy\r\n\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here by messaging me here or finding me in game. My steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on similar ideas ect..\r\n\r\n(plan on likely making a v2 adding more buildings and elements to the game play in the future depending on how well this map is received.)"
