I wish I could have done a larger map, but shading requires quite a big number of brushes.\r\nYou will notice the floating crates. I had to choose between floating crates or a bugged shade, because I don't really know how to make shades blend. If you have any ideas I'll be glad to launch a fix soon enough.\r\n\r\nThe textures of this map are the key colors of the game \"Mirror's Edge\", red and white, which is probably why the map is called \"edgecl\" (\"cl\" for cell).\r\n\r\nThe NAV file is included.\r\n\r\nThank you Karatek√§fer for skybox and Lost for cell shading tut.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map just as much as I enjoyed making it!\r\n\r\nDon't forget to assess!\r\n\r\nA.Werner\r\n\r\n***UPDATES***\r\n28/09/09 - GOOD NAV FILE (Thanks inso1984!)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
