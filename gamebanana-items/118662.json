I removed some props, and also opened other ways of shooting like windows and many other things.\r\nExtra: there are some hidden grenades all arround the map. Try to find them! :D\r\n\r\n<b>Credits: Valve for the map De_Inferno.</b>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
