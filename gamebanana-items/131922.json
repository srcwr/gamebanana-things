	"_sText": "This map has some light and has been known to show low fps on some slower computers.  My computer, which i consider to be average never dipped below 40fps and usually stayed around 60-70 fps. This is a low light map with flashlight helping in some places.  There are some secrets in this map and take a bit of thinking to get to if you can find them.  Think differently many of the spots to hide at are part of the scenery."
