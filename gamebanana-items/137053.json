This map isn't an exact replica of the set, but it incorperates some of the layout and features of the set. I incorperated some custom textures, a working elevator, and more. Have fun and enjoy.\r\n\r\nCredits goto: ]CS[ Scotch Tape for suggesting the idea, myself for making it, and to all the posters at www.fpsbanana.com for thier wounderful tutorials.\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading!!!\r\n<|TTF|> Jackorito\r\nClan <|TTF|>, Power in Numbers\r\nwww.clan-ttf.com"
