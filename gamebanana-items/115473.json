It is single player, and has three games which percentage scoring.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, the games don't have levels yet, just single rounds, they do add in points though.\r\n\r\nThis map is NOT meant to be put on a server though it does have nine spawn points, having more than one person can screw scoring up.\r\n\r\n<i>Right now the only weapon spawn is in the green game. If you want weapons use \"sv_cheats 1\" and \"give weapon_ak47\" ect.</i> \r\n\r\n<b>If the screen shots do not make sense, download the map and play it.</b>"
