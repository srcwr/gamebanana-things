The original place also have lightning that makes it hard to see, and you bump into walls all the time.</b>\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\nObjective: Kill your opponents, or get across the map and buzzkill them.\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\nWeapons: You start with an M4A1, Deagle, full Armor, and a HE Grenade.\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nThe thing about the button, is that in the real laser game, you have to shoot a sensor or something to win. Here, you press a button.\r\n\r\nAdded a skybox around the map so you can NoClip/Spectate around the map to get a better overwiew.\r\n\r\nIf you find this map confusing, just run around a little, you'll get the hang of it soon ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you flame me for stealing a map name, I didn't, the laser arena in the real world is called Wasteland.
