	"_sText": "Very big dm map to fight on. 64 spawnpoints. Sorry about the fps, you need a good PC to run this map, anyway I wanted to make it very big (I love such big battles). I played it with 15 bots and had 40-60 fps on Nvidia 210 1Gb. There is no bomb or hostages, because map size is very large for that...\r\n\r\nHope you like the map, cheers!\r\n\r\nP.S. If you want to use it in garrys mod - use it! If something will be wrong with it, say to me and I will correct it to GM or HL2."
