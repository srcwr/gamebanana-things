I fixed a lot of FPS issues throughout the entire map, decreased the height of the building causing rendering issues that leads to game crash, fixed model brushes and hint-skips combination to suddenly increase the FPS, removed unnecessary crane model at Ramp that dramatically decreases FPS and changed it to a simple block one. <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/286684\">Credits to him and to his map attempt.</a>&nbsp;Hand-tuned NAV and new skybox (militia_hdr)"
