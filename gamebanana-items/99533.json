	"_sText": "This map was designed upon request from James and the Hiven Clan, who are the valued sponsors of Dimension Studios. The map's dimensions and layout more closely resemble that of the original CS 1.6 version than TurtleRock's Source remake. Nevertheless the map includes all the advanced graphical feature that the current Source engine has to offer. This version of the map supports HDR and is recommeneded to be played with it enabled. The map has 32 spawn points to support a full classic CSS server and supports the latest CSS radar updates. Hand tuned navigation file is included for better bot and hostage performance. All the custom content except the nav file is bspzipped for ease in installation."
