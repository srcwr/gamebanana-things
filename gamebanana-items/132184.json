He got stuck with it so I pumped some life into it.  he and I continued to work on it for a couple more days, until we got the final product, seen here.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- 40 Spawns\r\n- Semi-realistic environment\r\n- 2 Special Underwater Areas\r\n- A Zombie Lab\r\n\r\nThe map isn't all abstract and random like my other maps.  It's got a touch of crazieness but if complication_v6 was too insane for you, this will be your chance to take a breather.  Credit goes to archangel for that lol.  And, many thanks to him overall.  He started off the map, which is always the hardest part.  I just filled in the details.\r\n\r\nQuestions and Comments are Always Welcome\r\n\r\n- Natalya</font>"
