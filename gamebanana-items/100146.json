	"_sText": "A remake of cs_militia. The idea when making this map was to try and keep things as true to the original map as possbile. With that in mind, layout is identical and props have been used sparingly to avoid clutter and the danger of changing gameplay unwittingly.\r\n\r\nThe map is textured and lit to be bright and clean, all the little militia features are intact, framerate is good and there is a nav file included which works well for both bots and....yes hostages work very well too!"
