	"_sText": "\"sequel\" to bhop_ametisti, a map I made around 5 years ago. I added onto it quite a bit more, it's not just a dev room with purple lighting. shoutout to cami who made the models. i also reused the tp's i used in crackrocks, just with a different color. lastly, when the map is booted up the console with spew out an unimportant error message. it's because the models don't have any collision or vphysics.Â <br><br>map is around 50 seconds with a 20-30 second bonus.<br><br>let me know if anything is wrong with it"
