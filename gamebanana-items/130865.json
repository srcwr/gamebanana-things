The sarge notices some of you are acting a bit strange. Hmmmm, I think it's time to run!\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo paths can be taken at the start, the bloodstained elavator or the creepy cave. Both paths converge at the minecart hub. The cave path contains a short minecart path. There are three minecarts at the hub and each lead to the same place. Pull the levers and get ready for one wild ride! The buttons on the minecart are for the horn , cant get enough of that :P. The rocks on the ceiling can be shot down to crush people and the minecarts will push them out of the way so dont worry if its in your tracks. The mine carts eventually crash and you have to take the rest in foot till you reach the elavator. The \"Engineer \"there will get the generator running and then tell you to test out his little zday plan. Thank god someone was prepared :P.  Fertilizer and barrels of deisel eh? interesting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
