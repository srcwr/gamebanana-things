	"_sText": "Ms. Pacman was, and still is, a great game.  I decided to turn it into a glass map.  In the first version, I had blocks.  That's it.  Then I rounded all of the blocks.  The biggest problem with this map was the damn textures.  I couldn't get a good combination.  Well, eventually, I did--however, I had received requests to make the map larger, to make the corridors narrower, and to put in breakable glass.  To expand the map, I put a lower level having nothing to do with Ms. Pacman.  (Although the colored lights are the colors of the 4 ghosts in the original arcade version.)  This lower level offered more safety than the top level, and I was able to put a second bombsite.  Then I killed two birds with one stone, making the corridors narrower by putting breakable glass 'padding' around the base walls.\r\n\r\n"
