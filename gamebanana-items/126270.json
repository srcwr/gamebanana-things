Ive added a little bit more to the last step on this one..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbhop_tut\r\n\r\nWell i made this map, cuz a m8 asked me to make a map, thats on a noobs lvl... He cant bhop and wants to learn it... Ive tryed to make a map thats for beginners.. But at the same time they will get some great tasks for beginners i think.. \r\n\r\nAnyway i dont know if this will help anyone to learn bhop, but the map is actually alright. im considering making a edition with no option to chose between steps... but i dont know... \r\n\r\nThis map is not based on detailed textured as you probably noticed... But still i think my textures are better than those Orange/Grey you see allround (i guess its from bhop_banana... idk)\r\n\r\nWell have fun with my map... "
