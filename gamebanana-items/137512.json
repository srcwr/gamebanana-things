	"_sText": "I did not design this map, a good friend of mine, Ownt, designed it. He sent me the layout of this map that was drawn on a piece of paper with the basics of what the map should look like. From there he gave me details of how he wanted everything to look, from there I took his ideas, and made the map. I changed it up a bit from his origonal idea and made a few creative changes to the map to make it look different. MoHaX Palm Trees Included.\r\n\r\nI even added an easter egg, or secret area. And i just decided to not say how to get to it, you'll have to figure that out yourself. :)\r\n\r\nAnd thank you to MoHaX for the excellent palm tree prefabs!"
