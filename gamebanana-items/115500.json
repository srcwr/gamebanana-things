	"_sText": "A very random map which has giant metal balls which circulate the map constantly, buy zones, multiple spawns, gun areas, multiple teleporters, 2 bombsites and other stuff you'll just have to find out on your own. ^^ Was originally in a beta2 stage, as you can see it has no textures applied anywhere, but the author never got around to making them. This map is about 5 years old, but I still love it as much as nippers_opus. If anyone would like to continue designng this map, just drop me a message."
