	"_sText": "The second version of the map. I have added a tunnel behind CT spawn that leads up the a high spot so as to even out the height advantage that T's had on the earlier version. I have also added some pillars in the middle and a couple boxes so the map isn't too open. I also fixed a few minor problems, and added light sources. I have shortened the boxes because before it was hard to jump up onto them, so now they can easily be jumped on to. Thanks to NAK93 for the letters and G-Flow for the skybox. "
