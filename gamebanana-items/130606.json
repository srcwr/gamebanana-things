	"_sText": "Finally ready the initial version of my map \"abandonedbase\" in this version I brought several changes since the structure of the map to the entities of the map. The history of the beta version that was \"one base on a bottom of the sea\" no longer applies, because we change the end of the map, is now based on a secret military base that was destroyed by a deadly virus. Good. I will cite some changes on the map:\r\n\r\n- Added more ammo in the guns of the map.\r\n \r\n- The doors never close.\r\n\r\n- Time nuke is activated when it gets close to the boats.\r\n\r\n- FOG and SkyBox map have changed.\r\n\r\n- Buttons of the doors that did not work in another room, now work.\r\n\r\n- New changes in the structure of the map.\r\n\r\n- Brightness of the map changed.\r\n\r\n- Balancing entire map.\r\n\r\n- Reduced time.\r\n\r\n- Light marking the buttons on the map.\r\n\r\n- Power Room Door opens automatically.\r\n\r\n- Improvements on the map.\r\n\r\n- Anti AFK on the safe room.\r\n\r\n- Power Room have new structure.\r\n\r\n- The nukes have shake now.\r\n\r\n- New means of escape.\r\n\r\n- Base TR and CT are now together and their structures were modified.\r\n\r\n- Was removed the time of 15 seconds the engine room on the second part of the map.\r\n\r\nThe map has more changes that can only be seen playing the map. Anyway ... I hope you enjoy the map, any bugs please contact me xD"
