(With some diferences)\r\nThe point of the map is that terrors must trap/hide CT's with knives.\r\nCT got automaticly a scout on map spawn.\r\n\r\nThere are some dark places in the map, find out the best spot and ambush the CT's! Team work is very useful.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map, I'll be working on it next few days.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
