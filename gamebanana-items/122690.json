	"_sText": "I'm going to go ahead and update this as the final product.  If there are any truly devastating problems I may reconsider, but it seems to be okay.  Simple map, really.  You are able to gain new weapons on each ramp/level of the tower.  If you want the new weapon be sure to drop your old one.  I tested this map with the settings from the surf server I frequent, Lobster Man's Surf-n-Turf.  There is a spot to get an m249, it's just a little out of the way."
