	"_sText": "I decided to take a shot at a surf map and prove nice ones could be made.  The map has tons of detail (compaired to other surf maps), and only weights in around 7mb unzipped, and 2mb zipped.\r\n\r\nHopefully thisll be a step forward for the surf community.\r\n\r\nThe map itself is completely possible (best with sv_airaccellerate 100), so if you dont succeed at first, try and try again.  Ive seen quite a few people complete it easily since they were surf veterans.\r\n\r\nDont forget to check out my website, www.AlexRoyce.com for more content."
