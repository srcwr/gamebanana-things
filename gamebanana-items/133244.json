This map has nothing really special but the orange / gray line in the middle wich changes the colors to opposite of what it was.\r\n\r\nAlso, the gateway on the 'bridge' has a illusionary part in the middle as a vision blocker.\r\n\r\nMap has 56 spawns if I correctly remember; 28T & 28CT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso this map has an HDR effect enabled, so don't forget to enable bloom effect for some nice gloomy visuals of the map!"
