So I've uploaded Version 2.\r\n\r\nNew version has a hidden smoke grenade as well as a bigger CT spawn.\r\n\r\nMap Created by Chaddcl0ps (G)^2\r\n\r\nSteamdid cl0pzilla\r\n\r\nAdd to your cstrike/maps folder\r\n\r\n\r\nENJOY!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the second version to my previous map release mg_smash_GamerSquared.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that the platforms don't fall.\r\n\r\nThe object is for the CT's to complete the course without getting blasted by the cannon which is controlled by the T's.\r\n\r\nThere are many different obstacles for the CT's to overcome. The cannon shoots every .75 seconds which allows the CT's to time the cannons shots will hiding behind the various structures.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy and add it to your public servers!\r\n\r\nRecommended on NoBlock servers"
