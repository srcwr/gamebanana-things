	"_sText": "This map is fairly small. It starts off where both teams are on opposite sides of the map. From there you can either go through the middle and, doing this, you would go over a grass hill in the middle of the map. On the left and right side are 3 more ways to get to the other side of the map. The first is an underground tunnel. The second is going over the top of a bunker where you will find a few things to hide behind. The third is right through the middle of the bunker. Doing this you can also stop in the middle of the tunnel going through and go right/left (depends on which one you run through) and run into the middle of the map to the grass hill. This map is small but has many different ways to be played which makes it excellent for gungame.\r\n"
