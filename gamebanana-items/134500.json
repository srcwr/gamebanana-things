	"_sText": "This is my first ever COMPLETED map.\r\n\r\nI make maps a LOT but I never really complete them OR upload them. So after I talked with Shirk from FPSBanana about mapping, I decided to give it a good shot. \r\n\r\nSo, this is a Gungame map, it uses the default DEV textures from VALVe, a few custom DEV textures from Chris528, and a custom skybox from GFLOW. Links available below.\r\n\r\n=============FEATURES==============\r\n \r\n*2 open towers on opposite sides of the map, entrances blocked by UNbreakable glass walls. (NOTE: the towers are tall and hollow but you cant reach the top and theres no platforms or multiple stories inside because in a gungame map that wouldnt make much sense :| )\r\n\r\n*2 stories, the main level then a lower level with edges protected by player_clip so you can stare off the edge at the bottom of the skybox\r\n\r\n*Half circle hiding spots\r\n\r\n*Spawnpoints so that you can add buyzones or whatever you want, to the raw file and play whatever you want.\r\n\r\n*Lighting that suits the skybox\r\n\r\n*Custom FPSBanana logo clearly visible on the front of one of the towers (NOTE: The FPSBanana logo will be added to FPSBanana so you can position it in your maps :D But if you use it, could you please give me credit? Because it was a bit of work creating it :D\r\n\r\n===============LINKS================\r\n\r\n46 dev texture pack by Chris528\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/707\r\n\r\n\r\nflowsky04 by G-FLOW\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/996\r\n\r\n================VIDEO=================\r\n<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CurtqReZ5ec&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CurtqReZ5ec&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>"
