	"_sText": "This map was created by my brother, Balefire blueotta@hotmail.com with some detail help by me.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly standard de map, with very original bombsites.  It has a beautiful outside area featuring a stream, a dam, cliffs, cave, an arch overpass, and more.  The insides are complex enough that halls intertwine and the enemy can come up behind you when unexpected.  This map is definately worth the download and try on your server.  And wait for the final version in the next month or two also.\r\n\r\nThis map is still in its testing period so any comments or suggestions are appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
