	"_sText": "\"I made a version of pacman for CS:S. I did all the textures and brushwork from scratch. It's my first release. It's clean, polished and simple. I really liked the original maps by Adam Hawkins (flf_pacman,flf_mspacman,flf_pacmanjr) and B4K73R1U5/Murd3rd0ll (cs_pacman), so I made what I think is a decent remake. Build time was very short. Not more then few nights of work.\r\n\r\nTwo different versions of the map ar included geek_pacman & geek_mspacman.\r\nMy next work will be something a bit more original."
