	"_sText": "Nuclear submarines, torpedoes, and lashings of crumbling architecture.  This is my first submission to FPSB, although I've been absent-mindedly mapping for HL and mods since CS was in its infancy.  I'm no expert, but I'm learning, and I'm actually happy with this one.\r\n\r\nThere's not a great deal of variety in the lightmap scale, and not much in the way of custom content (although I did throw together a few custom textures for certain purposes).  I started this map aeons ago, when I knew a lot less about navving than I do now.  Nevertheless, I'm genuinely happy with how it's turned out, and hope it makes for fun times wherever it's used.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know the elevator is buggy - going from 3rd to 2nd, it visits 1st first.  It doesn't really affect gameplay, but it's worth noting.  \r\n\r\n== Update: The nav file has been completed, and the finished zip file reuploaded.  Thanks to Chizbone for the hard graft. :)"
