NO, I'm not proud of it, but atleast I managed to finish it. Was quite challenging.\r\n\r\nThe concenpt is quite simple, make it look more futuristic, keeping the gameplay as classy as possible. You'll also notice (if you play test it) some influences I got from other classic maps such as Ice World and Pool Party.\r\n\r\nDONE.DONE.DONE.\r\n\r\nMeh, have fun I guess.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
