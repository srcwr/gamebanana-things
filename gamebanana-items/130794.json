Illya is built over a rich vein ofÂ natural resources running deep into the earth. The city itself is privately run by the corporation, with profits obtained from its mining operation.<br><br>Unfortunately, corporate greed may have gone too far. There may be more than anticipated lurking beneath the city.<br><br><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>5 unique stages</li><li>Varied gameplay, covering ze with zm segments</li><li>Various custom materials, models, particles</li><li>Several interactive cinematics</li></ul><br><h2>About this project</h2>This map was originally based on an photo found on <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/evilbuildings\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://reddit.com/r/evilbuildings</a> in early 2017. It changed a lot as I heard more about Cyberpunk 2077. The design of the city section was based very vaguly on what I felt that game could look like, before screenshots were available. Although, due to engine limitations, it lacks a lot of detail. Hopefully over time this can be optimised and visually improved.<br><br><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>This map will be ported to CS:GO. Please give it some time.</li><li>This is a beta release. Expect some bugs. Expect some balancing issues.</li><li>As much as I loved Fate/Kaleid, this map has nothing to do with it. The name is pure coincidence.</li></ul>"
