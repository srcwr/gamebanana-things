Contact me on my Steam profile \"SlayAChicken\" or on here if you fine any issues with the map. This is a short but the longest map I made so far, and I'm proud of it. The next map I will do will have improve lighting and hopefully triggers, if you wanna teach me how to do those properly that would be amazing! But for now, enjoy this map.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p>"
