	"_sText": "This is a Gun Game map with 32 spawn points. There are no Buyzones.\r\n\r\nThis map is very quick for gameplay, yet it also has a few decent camp spots for those of you that are scared of combat. It is excellent for gungame as there are scenarios within the map that are well suited for every gun in CS (decent snipe/camp areas, decent run n' gun areas, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe only real difference between this map and the original Bad Neighbors map is that I've opened up the houses. (This was by popular demand.)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"
