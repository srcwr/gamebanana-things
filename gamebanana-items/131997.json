	"_sText": "A large Zombie Mod map with an upper outdoor area and an underground complex. The CT and T both spawn mixed at the upper and lower parts of the map as to try and eleminate the zombie domino effect you get on some levels. Also I have included the .vmf file with this submission. This is for anyone wanting to change spawns, retexture, or port the map to a different mod. All that I ask of anyone who does this is to give me credit for the design/layout of the level. \r\n\r\nCreated and compiled inthe Hammer Editor with Source Tools.\r\nAll Textures used are standard.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and happy zombie hunting."
