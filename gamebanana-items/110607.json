	"_sText": "People who play ka_soccer_2006 havnt really taken to change very well so i thought id take it upon myself and try and make something that looks abit more updated but itsnt that different. I've added more detail to the stands, more detailed pitch, round goal posts, dug out for subs/manager, changing rooms, corner flags, commentators area, radar overview and finally an after match lounge.\r\n\r\nThanks to Lolobubu for the original map.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it."
