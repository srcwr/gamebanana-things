I have removed the spot lights and added a new skybox texture to the map.  The removal of the spotlights has drastically increased the average FPS.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nBuy zones are included.\r\nPlease download, comment and enjoy!\r\n\r\n- 64 Spawns\r\n- Custom Skybox by komaokc\r\n- Custom Textures by Ryan\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Optimized for better FPS\r\n- Buy Zones\r\n- Nav File\r\n- Pakrat\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3lhA-TYz9YE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
