	"_sText": "<font color=\"#6666FF\">This is an updated version of zm_cabin_v2b.  Changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n-Added a brush to kill players who camp the top of the elevator and thereby block it. -\r\n-Added a third entrance to the underground portion of the map-\r\n--Said new entrance is a big stairwell next to T-Spawn.  It was added because when the map had more than 12 players, people would crowd the entrances to the underground (the elevator and the well) which would let the zombies kill most of the humans near the start of the round.  Play testing on a crowded 32-person server with a fast zombie spawn time has shown that the stairwell has equaled that out and made it much more fair for the humans.--\r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy the map.\r\n\r\nFor anyone wishing to play this map before adding it to their server, visit the N00b Unlimited zombie server:\r\n\r\n75.126.43.190:27015\r\n\r\nThe map has been a hit with the admins there and they switch to it quite often.</font>"
