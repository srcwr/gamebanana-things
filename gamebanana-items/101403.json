	"_sText": "Smaller version of <A HREF=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/67241\">de_cathedrill_pro</A>.\r\nExactly this is original map with shorter nave (longer main hall) and shorter transept (both halls crossing longer main hall). I made this next version of map by request of FPSbanana member, who complained about size of map and low framerate. Gameplay is faster now and framerate was increased of a bit. I also removed horses in halls crossing, they didn't fit to theme of map, like someone complained with pro version.\r\n\r\nEnjoy my map"
