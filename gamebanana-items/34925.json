It's a completely created from scratch and fully hand-tuned nav-file (because an original mapauthor's nav-file was not full playable auto-gen).<br><br>This Navigation Mesh is create manually at 50% because in auto-generated Navigation Mesh some areas were made incorrectly and many paths were not presented (almost all the passes through a windows and ladders, routes through a roof and also some other possible and important paths).<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh was fully Place Painted.<br><br>Well... bots use all possible ways now. And these amateur peasants are absolutely ready to start their bloody harvesting :-)<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the nav-file by original map author available to downloading with the <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/199869\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also try not to spoil by bullet's holes the expensive agricultural machinery and the equipment taken by the owner of a farm in leasing with extortionate bank percent! ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: Slove1 (for this excellent porting of original CS:GO map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>There’s possums in the autumn and there’s farm cats in the spring :D<br><br>"
