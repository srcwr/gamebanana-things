Though, has to recognize, it not the most popular routes both at bots, and at people :-)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Specific feature of the map: because of placement of one of the hatches on a Bombsite B someone from bots sometimes gets stuck driven into the corner a folding lattice. Beware the steel jaws! :D\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted (more detailed and pertinently than in the original mapauthor's .nav-file).<br>\r\n<br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator included in original .bsp and available to loading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/56618\">same map</a>.<br><br>\r\nPlay and Enjoy! All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nAldez (for this thrilled industrial-themed map... also for his other nice maps <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/10900\">cs_apartments</a> and <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/16621\">de_oldtown_beta</a>).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Happy Frags &amp; Good Luck!"
