Started out by being a dev textured map but I felt I should go with lego textures instead.\r\n\r\nPlease use constructive criticism on what could be improved.\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\nEdit: File has been changed to correct missing textures. Thank you The Bucket for the heads up.\r\n\r\nIf you have already downloaded it please delete the old files and re-download."
