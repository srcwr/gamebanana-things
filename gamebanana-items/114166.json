	"_sText": "This is the edited version of   aim_bridge_AH   (because the old one didn't work) I changed it a lot. Both maps are mine that's why I changed it.\r\n\r\nNOTE* In the screenshots it may look a little dark but trust me it's like full daylight out there the only dark spots are caused by shadows from the boxes. Ther'es plenty of light.\r\n\r\n\r\nI may be making a night-time version later but I'm not sure so if you like night time maps and you like this map keep your eyes out it'll probably be titled  fy_sea-portnight_AH\r\n\r\nor fy_seaside-portnight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPE YOU ENJOY!"
