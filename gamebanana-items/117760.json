	"_sText": "OK, this is my first map. I think it came out very well, but i am sick of working on it. So i dont plan on updateing it unless there is a major problem found (it takes FOREVER to compile). I made it with fast action in mind, DM or GG or just a standard us vs you kind of match. There are 15 spawn points for each side. I made a underground area (ladders into both CT and T spawns), and there are a few walls that you can walk through, but i dont think the games will last long enough for anyone to camp there... BTW, this is a very fun snipper map.\r\n\r\nTo save time, i have uploaded pics taken in a map viewer and not CSS, so the lighting quality and texture quality is way down.\r\n\r\nDue to my mapping n00bness, i havent placed any props on the map, other than breakable windows and doors."
