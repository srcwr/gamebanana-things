	"_sText": "Had a lot planned for this map (Was going to be 5 stages, Spring (this stage), Summer, Fall, Winter, and an underworld stage, and was going to use a less obnoxious skybox but got bored of making the floating island displacements.\r\n\r\nMap I made many months ago but didn't release it until now cause I wanted to let tuxxi use the theme (which he improved on greatly). Only real reason why I released is cause I feel like the bhop will be competitive on auto servers and I put quite a bit of time into it."
