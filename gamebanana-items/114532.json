It turned out \"ok\" but I dunno, it could be much better.\r\nI dunno whether bots work on this, you'll just have to try it and see.\r\nUm, the place up the top is accessible by being shot out of a cannon, IF THE GRAVITY IS 300 OR LESS;\r\nThis place contains awps, so, if you don't want awps on your map, don't set the gravity to 300 or below, cause you can get to it using the cannons.\r\n\r\nYes, cannons.\r\nGo up the ladder, press the button, BOOM, you shoot out.\r\nAlso, you can get in, and your friends can shoot you out from the outside of the cannon too.\r\nThe miniguns were a failure, they DID shoot, but IDK WTF happened.\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This map doesn't contain buy zones, the weapons on the ground are fully equipped with shit loads of ammo."
