	"_sText": "Hello everyone, this is the final release of my aim_dust_ak map.\r\nIt has 10 player spawns, 5 Cts and 5 Ts.\r\nAs in the title it is a dust dust setting and the layout of the map is pretty small, but just right for an aimmap.\r\nI fixed several bugs since the beta version, added a better skybox and I think I handled the balance pretty well.\r\nSo please download the map, rate it and give me comments about whether you like the map or not, any bugs, or just any other improvements.\r\nHave fun :-)"
