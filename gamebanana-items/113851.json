	"_sText": "This is a fix of fy_poolparty_v2, there were some annoying things and i also think that the map is not perfectly balanced.\r\n\r\nI removed the black bar over the ct spawn and also the gap where the t's could camp. I made a func_illusionary glass at t spawn where ct's could see t's feet, you can go, but don't shoot through. There are also some other small fixes and changes...\r\n\r\nI didn't make a rush protection, because there are server scripts which work better.\r\n\r\npls test and leave a comment, its my first upload ;)\r\n\r\nlg eatthefish"
