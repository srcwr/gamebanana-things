I just started mapping last week. :-) - This map has 3 floors: bottom (lounge type), 1st (office type), 2nd (lounge), 3rd (roof). There is indeed a secret room in this map.. there is a door on the 2nd floor but its locked. Somewhere in the map there is a hidden button. Find the hidden button to unlock the door. Inside the secret room there is buttons to control lighting, and a button to lock the door. There are also 5 buttons & a monitor to view areas of this map. There are 2 bombsites, 1 sort of hidden and 1 on the roof. I tried my best to make this map look good, be fun, and be fair to both teams. I hope they are. Well, I hope you enjoy this map, please don't be too hard on me cause it is my first map and there are some problems I couldn't fix."
