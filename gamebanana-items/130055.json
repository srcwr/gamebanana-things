	"_sText": "These maps are my first maps ever publicated so don't be to demanding please. The most elaborated map is Achievements_nade_t. I think it's a good idea but it isn't perfect. This is de version 1 of the maps. I will update them later!\r\n\r\nThe folder that you will download is compound by four maps (plus two texts and one picture):\r\n\r\n\t- Achievements_t_weapons;\r\n\t- Achievements_ct_weapons;\r\n\t- Achievements_nade_t;\r\n\t- Achievements_bomb;\r\n\r\nThis four maps can be used for almost all achievements you can do, but NOT ALL!\r\n\r\nThe name indication [_t_weapons or nade_t or _ct_weapons] is the name team that you need to go if you wont to complete it faster.\r\n\r\nRecomendations:\r\n\r\n\t- Start the game and run a private server without bots;\r\n\t- Write in console: bot_add_ct (if you are in terrorist team), bot_add_t (if you are in ct team);\r\n\t- If the private server goes down, don't worry, is just an update;\r\n\t- Now type in console again this three commands (be sure that is one bot in the other team): mp_autoteambalance 0, mp_limitteams 20, bot_knives_only;\r\n\t- Then type bot_add_(other team name t or ct) until the team gets full.\r\n\r\nNOW YOU ARE READY TO GET 90% OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS!!!\r\n\r\n\t- If you wont, you can put teammates but it will be harder to get the achievements.\r\n\r\nI think that is all, tank you for reading this and any questions you might have, just ask me. Have fun!\r\n\r\nAdd me on STEAM! - \" STEAM_0:0:30074362\""
