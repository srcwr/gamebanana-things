It was tedious but i did it...&nbsp;<br><br>You can attach the base of the light to any object... even a train, because it uses a parent system....<br>Just imagine.... in a ze map you have a dark map with a train that has a searchlight :D<br><br>Hope it's useful. If it has any bugs.... please let me know.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>"
