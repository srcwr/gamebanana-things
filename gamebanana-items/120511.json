	"_sText": "A new idea for CSS maps. The rounds starts in darkness with only a few elements to guide you trough the map (like the ceiling). Absolutly NECCESARY to use the flashlight to view the enemies. But when you do... They can see you too! That's what makes it interesting...\r\nIf someone camps and hide to not die... Don't worry... after a few seconds, a siren will sound alerting you that something bad is gonna happen. then the lights will turn on... and the floor will sink in poison water!!! Try to not get cought in the middle because you will be killed.\r\n\r\nATTENTION!\r\n- This map, was created to use in servers with the roundtime above 2:25 min!!\r\n- Not playable with BOTS (they don't know where's the button to turn on the flashlight XD)\r\n\r\nThat's it\r\nEnjoy!"
