Here is a CSS-transition from one of the map versions for CS.<br><br>\"Originally a level for Counter-Strike 1.6 competitive play, and created for ESEA and the community by myself. The original map idea was discussed by a panel of top players and community members to attempt a arena top pick. Knowing the restrictions for competitive mapping, I knew it would never get the justice it deserves on goldsrc engine. This rendition includes custom textures and models created by myself, and stock Half-Life 2 and CS:S assets.\" - from mapauthor's note at <a href=\"http://tedmcilwain.com\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">tedmcilwain.com</a><br><br>By the way the Fans of <strong>Counter-Strike 1.6</strong> can find here at GameBanana FOUR versions of this map: <a href=\"http://cs.gamebanana.com/maps/170195\">de_lite_rc1</a>, <a href=\"http://cs.gamebanana.com/maps/161958\">de_lite_rc2</a>, <a href=\"http://cs.gamebanana.com/maps/161959\">de_lite20100110</a> and final version <a href=\"http://cs.gamebanana.com/maps/170194\">de_lite</a> :-)<br><br>Despite Release Candidate state the map is absolutely playable also is well good designed!<br><br>About Playing with Bots: In original mapauthor's archive Navigation Mesh for playing with Bots was not included, but you can download separately the created from scratch, manually optimized (hand-tuned) and fully place painted&nbsp;<a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3379\">NAV-file</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy!"
