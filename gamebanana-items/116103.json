Thanks to the original creator of hoejhus9.\r\n\r\nChanges from \"hoejhus9\" original version:\r\n\r\n- Fixed Skybox\r\n- Changed Textures\r\n- Added other pathes\r\n- Added secret pathes\r\n- Added two teleporters\r\n- Fixed most of the mess in the map.\r\n- Added a big logo\r\n- Alot of Optimization\r\n- Reduced filesize\r\n- Added a secret bombsite \"B\"\r\n\r\nBelive me this took me some time to do since the original creator had messed the whole map up. It nearly took me a day just to fix his mess. Anyways i will upgrade this map soon with more advanced stuff! The original \"hoejhus9\" map didn't had any kind of optimization so no wonder that it sucked that much.\r\n\r\nif you want to contact me then send me a pm at my forum: www.alphaevolution.net\r\n\r\n- Meth0d"
