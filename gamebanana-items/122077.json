The main goal was to make an easy linear map, but I ended up finding some sorts of trick surfs that could be cool in it. I took advantage of this map to experiment many concepts that were new to me such as: reflections, HDR, opened map, easy linear surfing, multiple use of same ramps, 3D skybox, fog, etc. It was really fun to create. I have no expectation from this because it is not a common surf map (as the design lol) and it is very short as a linear, but I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed doing it! oooooh<br><br>Map: tier 1, linear, 6 bonuses.<br><br>Download link (css): <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/194789\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">http://gamebanana.com/maps/194789</a><br>Download link (csgo): <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/194790\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">http://gamebanana.com/maps/194790</a><br><br>Showcase video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBuwBsSPDqU\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBuwBsSPDqU</a><br><br>Thanks to sneak, noobre and marcowmadeira for helping me on some issues.<br><br>Credits to TopHATTwaffle and Komaokc for the assets (and all the others too)."
