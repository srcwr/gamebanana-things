	"_sText": "This is my first submission to Gamebanana! (Not my first map)\r\n\r\nA bit of backstory:\r\nIn the century following a lethal strike into the Marr Freight Company which had been secretly been receiving illicit funds packaged inside certain products, the district's property values declined sharply. After a swift and silent coup d'etat a radical governor took power in the mountain city. Since then strict cleanliness laws have been imposed on the city. These are however, only enforced with those firms that pay a higher tax annually. Where does that money go? Nobody knows. What is known is that those businesses that fail to jump on this pricey bandwagon end up out of business and rundown.\r\n\r\nTaking place in on the sketchy border between the good and bad sides of town, this scene sees the clashing of elite police forces and disgruntled small business owners  under the moon.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis was built off of the original geometry of cs_assault. I take no credit whatsoever for the layout or inspiration of this map. This may still have bugs and bots may have occasional issues. Enjoy the aesthetics and with luck the bots will give you a good challenge :)"
