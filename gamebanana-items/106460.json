The map is balanced, a good modern/futurist architecture, and good gameplay.\r\nPlayers spawn with a Deagle, knives, and a Frag Grenade. Every time the round starts thats what you will get by losing or wining the last round.\r\nThis map includes a 3DSkyBox.\r\nThe File comes with a auto generated Nav. file.\r\n\r\nThis map is <b>pr0^^</b> and I is not lier! =D\r\n\r\nHave Fun\r\nAim it\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
