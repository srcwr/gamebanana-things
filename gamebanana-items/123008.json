Most people have probably played the beta, since it's been in rotation on the ksf timer-server for a while, but that was not a finished map..\r\n\r\n*Fixes*\r\nFixed the Fps-issues that occured midway through the map.\r\nHundreds of texture corrections.\r\nOptimization throughout the entire linear part.\r\nProbably more, can't remember.\r\n\r\n*Additions since the beta*\r\nAdded a 5-staged map as a bonus.\r\nSeveral new easter-eggs, which are spread out through the map. The entrance to the \"bonus-map\" is hidden, and you have to find it yourself. (Although most of you will just noclip :c)\r\n****\r\nI hope everyone will enjoy the map, and I'd like to thank Sangre and Billy for their amazing contributions, which makes me look an awful lot like a rookie when it comes to map-design.. ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to thank Ryan S and Power-Fusion, because the jails they started for this map were freaking awesome, it's just a shame that they never got finished in time. Can't wait much longer because I'm going to the army etc, so the map is getting released as-is.\r\n\r\n~razer."
