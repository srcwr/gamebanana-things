	"_sText": "Exactly the same as the original bsod_poolday except I have reduced its file size by half, I have got rid of most custom textures and have embedded all remaining models and textures into the bsp, making for a much tidier end result. Adding models to bsp has also remideed the issue of models loading from server to client as there  is no need to a .res file naymore.\r\n\r\nOh and again many thanks go out to the original creator of poolday, for bringing us so many hours of pleasure. =P"
