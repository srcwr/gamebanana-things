	"_sText": "This map has many different buildings, all of which you can enter and shoot from the windows,the roofs or the balconies.\r\nHowever, what makes this map special is the underground tunnels, which are connected to the surface through many different points by ladders or even underwater tunnels. This special feature makes the map much more exciting as fighting can take place in two different areas and you can use the tunnels to travel from one place to another.\r\n\r\nThe map includes a very simple 3D skybox which makes the map look much larger. I have thought about adding bombsites, but I don't know where. Do you think the map is fine as it is, or should I add bomsites? Please comment."
