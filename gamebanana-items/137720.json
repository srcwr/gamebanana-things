There are 2 bonuses on the map that should was on surf_klue, but for some reason were removed at the last moment.<br><br>The textures of the ramps are made in the form of hexagonal grids that smoothly flow from purple to pink, and they also blend harmoniously with the rims that highlight the edges of the ramp.<br><br>The whole idea of the map is contained in the 3 stage. On it, you can see two co-ordinally different ways. One tier4 for the weak, the second for the experienced tier6+ . The time difference is significant.<br><br><span class=\"RedColor\">As always, source can't work with model lighting :/</span><br><br>I hope you will positively evaluate this map and stay with pleasant emotions after playing it!<br><br>"
