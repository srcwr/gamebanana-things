	"_sText": "This is a remake of the map dm17 from Quake3 Arena. Custom textures, ingame music (guess what, music from Q3A) and of course many teleports. A must have for any Quake 3 lover. It is recommended that you play with 10 players max but it can support as many players as you want. Only for the Deathmatch plug-in. It won't work nice on standard servers. \r\n\r\nNote that there is a \"haste\" powerup like in Q3A.\r\n\r\n\r\n***EDIT***\r\nv 2.0\r\nOriginal map's music has been added.\r\nOriginal map's background sound has been added.\r\nMore custom textures.\r\nMore custom Sounds.\r\nCustom made medkits including +50, +25 and megahealth.\r\nAdded jump pads and launch pads.\r\nremoved teleporters which were not included in the original map.\r\nAdded overview.\r\nMore corrections to various brushes.\r\nMore corrections to textures.\r\nMore lights. \r\nSome more triggered sounds.\r\nEdited many .VMTs\r\n\r\nJust this :D .\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it! \r\n\r\n***UPDATE***\r\nbspzipped all files."
