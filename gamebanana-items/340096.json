	"_sText": "hey guys. I genuinely believe that this map is the one that lifts me out of bhop mediocrity and into bhop averagility lol. I really enjoy this map though. I managed to get a lot of testing done from people and I am eternally grateful for them taking their time out to help me. Special thanks for lilac for uploading two different betas to his server (cutehops). Also huge thanks to Kris. he helped me so much with testing.<br><br>Map is either tier 3 or tier 4 I can't decide (leaning towards 4). The lowest segment I've seen so far so I'd say it's save to say the map is 1:40-1:50ish seconds. There are 7 stages, varying in length.<br><br>Originally for this map I had wanted it to be longer. However, I quite literally reached the brushside limit for this map and had to cut it short. Originally I had two bonuses and was planning for atleast 8 stages. Nonetheless, I don't think cutting the map short will take away from the quality at all. I hope everyone enjoys it! Thanks"
