But Terrorists don't want their plans to be \r\ndiscovered and decided to self-destruct the whole base. This can be done\r\n if the rocket in the silo is bombed or the biological weapons in the \r\ntrain loading station. This corresponds to bombsite A and B.</i><br><br>- The map should be balanced for each team.<br><br>This map is intended to look a bit like BM:S. I put alot of effort into this, I hope you like it.<br><br>btw the silo hatch is brushwork, im very proud of it lol<br><br><font color=\"orange\">Features:</font><br><br>- Optimisation, has FPS as if you play maps like cs_assault, de_inferno, cs_italy etc. <br>- Radar Overview<br>- HDR<br>- Cubemaps<br><br><b>Big thanks to <a href=\"//gamebanana.com/members/1369773\">Meurglis3</a> Who Made Great <a href=\"//gamebanana.com/gamefiles/4706\">Hand-Tuned NAV file</a> - If you want to play with smarter bots.</b><br><br>Enjoy.
