The map consists of several mazes the solutions of which are obtained by solving the hints provided in the readme-hints.txt file included with the map. (I recommend printing them)\r\n\r\nThis is not a fighting map, and I strongly recommend using a script to provide godmode to all of the players so that they don't complain about drowning in level 3.\r\n\r\nI've received a lot of good feedback on it, and I hope you guys enjoy it."
