A rock wall thing seperates the 2 teams at start But there are ways to get passed it. A fair share of secrets on both sides and a little ambience to make it feel a little more real.\r\n\r\n<b>Expect From the Final Version</b>\r\n\r\n-Smoothed out and rounder secret cave entrances.\r\n-Spawn with a grenade\r\n-More grenades on the ground\r\n-HDR\r\n-Bushes and trees \r\n\r\n"
