So Counter Terrorists must prevent the terrors from geting weapons which are all around the map. If they get them they should be fastly droped or the Terrorist must be imediatly killed before he kills someone.\r\nJust a warning: Try not to kill inocent people :)\r\n\r\nTerrorists:\r\nGet weapons and kill the Counter Terrorist or simply respect them orders until die :D\r\n\r\nCredits to me myself, Nunoft who helped me to test the map out and mrmof who gave me the idea of the smoke trap from the map: Cs_jailhouse.\r\nThats it. I hope you have fun play it.\r\n\r\nI WOULD LiKE TO KNOW IF YOU MAKE USE OF THIS MAP IN YOUR SERVER :D\r\nDONT FORGET TO COMMENT :D <---- THATS IMPORTANT :)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
