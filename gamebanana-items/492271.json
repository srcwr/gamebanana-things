I don't know the exact locations of the hostages, but I do know what rooms they are in. I assume the creator is this person:&nbsp;https://gamebanana.com/members/209447<br><br>&nbsp;Here is the original mod:&nbsp;https://gamebanana.com/mods/100122<br><br>Not really sure how copyright works in general, but id like to emphasize that I did not create this mod, and are just adding the missing hostages. I have sent an email to the original creator asking for permission."
