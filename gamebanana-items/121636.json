I would've added more, but I didn't.\r\n\r\nIt's just a surf map, it's not very long, pretty easy for most people. I spent most of my effort on the spawn, as you can clearly see (though the displacements are whack). You surf down to the end. If you're good enough there's a special place with a buyzone, some awps and stuff. V8 out with more secrets.\r\n\r\n(rerelease from v7)"
