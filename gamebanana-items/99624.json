There are 3 total entrances into the building, including the front door, a back alley way, and a sewer entrance. This map is built for up to 24 players, although it may get cramped in full conditions. Optimal size would be 20 players or less. This is a beta release which does not include a waypoint file as of yet. However, the final release will have that file included."
