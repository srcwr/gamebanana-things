They are still arguing each other. The local police rather wants to enjoy the view from the tower and use the bridge to get to a restourant.\r\n\r\nThe 3 main routes provide a lot of options to approach. They are suitable few players as well as many players. The Ts can easily switch to another bomb target. So the bomb is planted often. To give the CT a fair chance, the bomb spots are not that hard to capture and CTs have 2 rather short paths between the bomb spots. Furthermore I tried to make it grenade friendly. It Provides 64 spawn points.\r\n\r\nThanks for constructive feedback.
