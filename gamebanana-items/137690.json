	"_sText": "(04/05/2019 -> DESCRIPTION UPDATED)<br>(02/18/2012 -> MAP UPDATED AND FIXED)<br><br>This map took months to get done... it was not hard to make at all, it's just the ideas that took a long time to show up. It's themed as a library, with wooden surf ramps and bookshelves inside a big room. <br><br>There are plenty of secrets of how to get weapons and grenades. There's also one that takes you to an empty white room, with nothing but a lever... that kills everyone in the map (but you) when pulled. Plus, there are also 4 buttons in a bookshelf (the nearest to the clock) which can give you either AK-47, M4A1, SG552 or AUG. <br><br><b>NOTE</b>: It has a Bomb Zone too, in its very center. <br>(for Terrorists to blow the shit up)<br><br>The following video shows all the secrets of the map and some free-styling. Enjoy!<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnkaj_y30UA \" \"\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Video</a>"
