I've recently taken an interest in map making, so after reading 80% of the well written tutorials here I've come up with this GunGame Deatmatch style map design to keep both teams on their toes. It might not look like much but you can't comment based on screenshots. Try it out on your servers and see for yourself how much action really gets handed to you. Since I'm a brand spanken new mapper I'll be making a lot of maps; expect more to come. Hope you all have fun with this. :D I know the regulars and new people at my server (rnp.b3ta.org:27015) just love this map."
