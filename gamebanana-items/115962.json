	"_sText": "Ok, first off, I had to submit this twice because of a mishap of creating a map type in which to put this map in. In turn an Admin deleted the map type and that also apparently deleted my map in the process. It says I have submitted one map, but when clicked and my map section is checked, there is nothing there. There are no improvements, this is the same map. However, I am going to create a second version of this map.\r\n\r\nI have two maps in production, De_BoxTemple and De_TissueBox\r\nTissueBox was supposed to be done by yesterday around 6, but I've ran into several setbacks in and outside of the computer. But it will be out by tonight or tomorrow (after I get back from some crappy Easter party), and I should have another map out for Monday since I have the day off.\r\n\r\nAfter those two are done then I will have plans for a quick remake of a Call of Duty 4 map and possibly a zombie escape map. I'll see what comes.\r\n"
