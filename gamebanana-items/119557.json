	"_sText": "My first map made from scratch, my friend's going to use to hopefully host a mini 1v1 tourny. What Fun! didnt get TOO creative with the things on the map, just tried to keep it somewhat simple, but focused more on the box placements to keep the 1v1 varied and fun\r\n\r\n2 AWPS on each side, hard to get to tho mid round. So if you are fast u might be able to get at end or if you are sneaky enough to ninja up there and get. That is to say you are good with an AWP =). Kept an even amt of M4 and AK spawns.\r\n\r\nHave fun."
