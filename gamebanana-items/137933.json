All that's certain is that he's still here after all this time and is making it possible :)<br>The themes of stages on this map are based on Sacred's maps (calamity2, nemesis, elysium, calibration), as well as one bonus is based on his past (maybe even current) favorite map, surf_exile.<br>Tier is maybe 4-5 idk.<br><br><b>notices</b>:<br>- bonus 1 boost is too weak if you try to play it on Momentum Mod, it works in CSS just fine,<br>- the map is not considered to be ported to other Source Engine games, if you want to do that, then decompile the map (or ask masog for .vmf), take the assets from the .bsp and work it out yourself (just a note that the map is only possible to be compiled with -notjunc, as it exceeds the T-Junctions limit)."
