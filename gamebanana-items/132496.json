I really woulden't recommend running this on a regualr server becuase both T and CT spawns are right beside each other. This is my first map and I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to c0ldfyr3 for created such an awesome plugin. www.zombiemod.com\r\n- Thanks to [Ao1]Something[Atd] for helping me get orientated with the map.\r\n- Thank you for playing my map.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\nChanges in beta 3\r\n=========================\r\n- Removed more useless props.\r\n- Improved map FPS even more.\r\n- Ladder to tree house improved even more.\r\n- Each ceiling glass strip in pool area now has 2k health.\r\n- Rave room music should work now.\r\n- Added and fixed alot of bugs.\r\n- Added alot of detail too the map.\r\n- Cleaned up some of the clutter here and there.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This map has been out awhile, I slacked on putting it on here, I don't ever remember why. But here it is. I decided to update it because I still saw servers using b2. b3 is a vast improvement, like how b2 was a big improvement over b1. I am currently working on V4...5 months later...I know...I know. I'm hoping V4 might be the final version of my map. But I still don't know. Guess we will see. :)\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first map i've made. So give me some slack. =P"
