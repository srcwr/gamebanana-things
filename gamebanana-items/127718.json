	"_sText": "(Bad Images, I know read below)\r\n\r\nNew take on an old cs 1.6 classic. 1 team spawns with awps in the building and 1 with knifes in the submarine which launches them at the building. The sides randomly swap each round 50% chance to switch. A lot of fun simple and addicting. You can land directly through the window and live for fastest way inside if the server is not lagging. Enjoy\r\n\r\n-Forgot to take screenshots for this pc, so I took a snapshot from someones youtube video as temporary screenshot which I will replace in future.\r\n(In fact here is the video I just used shows how the map is played briefly http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2VOll73UGo)-\r\nSet up for 64 spawns Please contact me before decompiling or using anything in here by messaging me here or finding me in game. My steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918 Please leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on similar ideas ect.."
