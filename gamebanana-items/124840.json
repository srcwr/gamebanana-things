	"_sText": "Port of the Quake 3 DeFRaG map r7-menacy, created by r7 AKA Rust7. Small sort-of-strafe map with 1 checkpoint in the middle. Sort of difficult to route but the jumps are easy themselves. Only added 1 jump and removed the water because I prefer the look of it. Literally the fastest I've ever ported a map. It took me about 10 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Difficulty: Easy - Medium<br>Length: Less than 1 minute, possibly around 30 seconds.<br><br>I believe the guy I credited is the real Rust7 but if it's not I'll link his worldspawn q3df \"profile\" here:<br><a href=\"null\">https://ws.q3df.org/maps/?map=&amp;au=Rust7</a><br>"
