Bots aren't very good foes because they just jump to death in\r\nthe beginning of the round and the others will follow them. This map is good for ordinary gaming, rpg servers and partly wcs. Its not cool to block the ways with Serpent Wards. NOT for servers with alots of players. Only 16 slot map."
