	"_sText": "I made this map about a year ago. It is a water treatment facility. The main bomb site is actually down in the bottom of the plant, near a generator and pipes. The second one is in the control booth.  It was originally designed as a hidden map but I decided it would probably make a good cs:s map as well.  This is the first beta of the map so tell me what you think. I know it isn't perfect so any advice would be great."
