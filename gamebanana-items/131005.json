	"_sText": "ZE_SORRENTO_ESCAPE - BY ROGER GARGANTUA \r\nVersion : V5 ( ze_sorrento_escape_v5 )\r\n\r\nThis is my third map. I believe this is the first escape map which has Italian styled environment and buildings. Named it after Sorrento, an Italian coastal village near Napoli where my mother used to live. Easy name to remember....\r\nBut it's construction is inspired upon Scheveningen. A coastal town in Holland with a huge pier and boulevard. But I thought it would be nice to have an Italian styled environment in an escape map since they are more exciting to build then Dutch buildings. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* 64 spawnplaces\r\n* 5 different routes to the end\r\n* including 1 SECRET route\r\n* 3D-Skybox\r\n* My trademark: \r\n   a building which holds grenades and guns\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n- i3D.net for their great servers and because I am admin on it \r\n- Salem from i3D for putting up my maps and being a great support\r\n- Skaelman for helping and solving my 3d-skybox problem\r\n- Many others, including the people I see in servers and on my Steam friendlist\r\n\r\nROGER GARGANTUA \r\n\r\naka GARGANTUA[i3D]\r\n\r\nMap changes in version 5 ( ze_sorrento_escape_v5 )\r\n- Less barrels \r\n- higher crates at seadome tower\r\n- minor changes here and there"
