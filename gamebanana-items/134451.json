Updates include the implimentation of HDR, radar overview textures and a slight adjustment to a former floating crate.\r\n\r\nThis is a really fun map to play and is quite popular for the Gun Game mod.  If there is enough demand, I will make this map again for fy,  Come along to the |SA| server for a game:\r\n\r\n194.105.134.64:27015\r\n\r\nFinally the radar is still not working correctly, However I know why and I can fix it if I ever release this map again.  I will however have radar overviews for all my future maps though and I might do a tutorial on it depending on demand."
