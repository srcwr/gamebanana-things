If only the one team press it, the wall will take 30 secs to start open, and if both of the team have pressed it, it will open in 3 secs, while in 1,5 secs the Metal walls will begin moving to each side with different speeds :)\r\n\r\nHave fun, and have a nice Aim Fight! :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\niCe"
