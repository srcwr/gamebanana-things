Please download and enjoy my map and let me know what you and your server communities think of it.\r\n\r\n<u>Credits:</u>\r\n\r\nMap design and creation by 'cS.Metz\r\nwith special thanks to Fibbs\r\nand my friends for some trap ideas\r\n\r\n<u>Map Details:</u>\r\n\r\n- 15 traps (two skill/random)\r\n- 3 standard endings\r\n- 2 small secrets\r\n- 1 secret ending\r\n- AFK Timer (one minute)\r\n- Map Timer (five minutes)\r\n\r\n<u>Update Log:</u>\r\n\r\nv1beta\r\n- Release version</font>"
