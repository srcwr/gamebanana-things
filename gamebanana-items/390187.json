Jailbreak, dated 29/12/2008.<br><br>Created by BlackOps and M.I.A, this is one of the very first maps for M.I.A. 24/7 Jailbreak.&nbsp;<br><br>Los-Angeles encapsulates the flow that M.I.A. intended for his jailbreak server; fast-paced and extremely difficult for guards. Gun room has several easily reached access points, and the cell area is designed in a way so that clearing vent cell is a hard task.&nbsp;<br><br>Even today Los-Angeles is one of the most popular maps in Australian Jailbreak (the only active server that retains an identical style to M.I.A. Jailbreak).<br><br>This map contains a basketball court, pool, soccer field, a large outside area with watch towers, and a kitchen."
