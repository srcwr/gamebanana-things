Control of certain parts of this map can be useful as there certain things that can give you an advantage (helicopter, trams, armory, warehouse, CCTV room).&nbsp; Oh and CCTV,helicopters and trams are all working.&nbsp;<br><br>This map was also a test for myself as a mapper, to see what can i come up with and do.&nbsp;<br><br>Instructions:&nbsp;<br>When you download the map, every file will be in a folder, that has the same name as the folders in your steam directory.&nbsp;<br><br>If you see some bugs or problems, please let me know, as this is the alpha version. :)"
