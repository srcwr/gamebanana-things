	"_sText": "This is just an experiment. I wondered what the world would be like if everything was suddenly flipped. Of course, it costs too much to do it to real life, so I had to settle with de_dust 2.\r\n\r\nIt's distorting. Confusing. Although it's exactly the same map to play, it feels different. Some people might hate it. Others might find it breathes a new lease of life into an excellent, albeit overplayed map.\r\n\r\nObviously I don't claim to have made it. All I did was to flip it, then fix the displacements, the props that didn't flip properly, and then I finished it off by lining the skybox up again and enduring a lengthy compile time. Once again, I stress that I don't claim to have made this map, though I'm sure that there will be some one who attacks me for passing it off as my own. I don't know if the appeal will wear off straight away or if it will breathe a new lease of life into the map. I'd like to find out.\r\n\r\nOh and I included the original Dust2 as well, with added HDR."
