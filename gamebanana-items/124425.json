I've been working on and off and it's almost ready to be finalized. \r\n\r\nI would love to hear some **constructive criticism**, I am waiting to fix all the small details that need to be fixed, which I didn't notice. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, please let me know of anything. \r\n\r\n- also I do know the glass is purple in my screenshots. I hope that's only my problem, otherwise let me know and I will look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- beta 5 \r\n*Added custom skybox to the map file with Pakrat"
