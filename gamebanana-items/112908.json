I've decided to re-release it, for an unknown reason.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n-Texture changes, which I think give the map a new feel.\r\n-Optimization changes\r\n-Raised guns\r\n-Stairs to platform in the center, to hopefully make the game-play a little more exciting\r\n-New lighting\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like Iceworld, this is the map for you.  I hope you all enjoy, and as always, comments and ratings are greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nIf there is a need to contact me for problems/bugs/questions/suggestions/complaints:\r\n\r\nXfire: Wowyourgaiy\r\nEmail: Phantomoper3@comcast.net\r\n"
