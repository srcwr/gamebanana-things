	"_sText": "The main purpose of the map is... sniping! Can you believe it? You spawn, and there are giant 4 giant blocks around you. 3 Smaller ones, and one huge seperator between spawns. Buy a sniper (or anything else if you know how to get to the other spawns (or if you're feeling brave (or if you're pro))) and walk around the other side of the smaller blocks. TAH-DAH! A ladder! Time to climb... then snipe! If you look above you on top of the blocks, high in the sky, you will see 5 autosnipers. I'm not telling you how to get them, but rest assured, if you do, you will be in sniping heaven. The only problem is, I knew how to get there, and I still died about 5 times trying. Enjoy! :D"
