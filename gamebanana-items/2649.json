	"_sText": "This is a fully functional brush-based tank prefab based on the German WW2-era Panzerkampfwagen VI \"Tiger\" tank. You can drive it by using the wheel at the front seat, although it's very clumsy and you have to drive carefully by tapping the seat to not die. I'm sorry but that's as good as I could make it, for now. You can man the turret by using the cranks. Arrow keys aim, secondary attack loads a shell, and primary attack fires. The tank can also be destroyed if another tank hits it's engine in the back. The tank will become immobile and start burning, killing the crew inside. The prefab has 90 entities and it took fucking ages to finish."
