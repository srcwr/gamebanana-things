	"_sText": "Made by tom_tom. Gungame based on a dust style look with a new twist while in the desert. Both sides are equally matched with a unground path, and main building. added dust and wind to contribute to the looks. placed player clips to stop catching to the door/window frames to ensure no 'stupid' accidental deaths because of getting stuck. Made sure there no way to get caught on top of door/window frames as well. placed blocks and made sure all drops don't cause damage besides jumping off the roof of corse. maximum players is 24."
