	"_sText": "OK, here it is. My month-long project finnaly complete. It took around a month to build, edit. Extra, texture & finish.\r\n\r\nFairly large, medium map. \r\nSand dunes surround you while you hold out in OutPost29.\r\n\r\nThis map features the following;\r\n\r\nLab/Contact room.\r\nCage for your admins to teleport Zombies, in this case Arachnid into.\r\nArmoury to re-plenish your ammo - M249 Machine Gun. P90. & M3 Shotgun. All weapons have 500 adittional rounds.\r\nTower.\r\nDefensive postions.\r\nProps to barricade the gate.\r\nAdditional entrances.\r\nCustom textures. (Thanks Griffen)\r\nLots of detail on base surrounding & inside.\r\n\r\nOK. That about does it. \r\n\r\nAlternet download:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=111972\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~Install~ Right'O. \r\n\r\nWhen you have downloaded the map from one of the excelent supplyers, open the \".zip\" file.\r\nInside the \"Cstrike\" there should be \"Materials\" & \"Maps\".\r\nDrag, to Cstrike/Cstrike or copy & past into the area. The only reasonI included the \"Materials\" is is because I don't have the tool for Custom Textures, sorry.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this map, there is a server that it will be using; \r\n69.197.190.188:27015\r\n\r\nThanks to all that helped make this map. \r\nPlease leave feedback on improving this map!\r\nDo correct me if I missed anyone in the Credits and please rate/Vote this map!\r\n\r\nHappy Fragging.\r\n\r\n\r\nEJHF."
