	"_sText": "So here's another quick gun game one. I haven't played it yet, but it should turn out ok. Plenty lighter than my past couple maps with neat little features here and there. I didn't see a reason for a 3D skybox on this one, but enjoy!\r\n\r\nBEWARE: Falling will kill you!\r\n\r\nv1 UPDATE: Ok, so the odd textures have been removed, 3d skybox added, and I fixed ambient sound in the canyon. There you go! Thanks for suggestions! (Oh and the screenshots show the new one.)\r\n\r\nv2 UPDATE: Alrighty, spawn points should check out ok, now."
