	"_sText": "This map was made by my brother, who allowed me to upload this map. ch00se made this map, not me.\r\n\r\nch_run is a fun map that puts the scout wielding Terrorists at the bottom of a hill, where they can't escape. Meanwhile, the CT's spawn are at the top of the hill gunless, and have access only to strategically placed smoke grenades. The CT's must find their way down the hill, using the maps props and walls as cover. Once they make it near the bottom, and at the Terrorists mercy, they have an option to either try and make their way into a pistol and grenade haven which is a small room that's safely covered, or use a jump booster to propel themselves up the the platform where the terrorists are shooting from.\r\n\r\nDuring the CT's run down the hill, they had better keep their head on a swivel, and don't forget to look up! Glass ceilings house small supplies of smoke grenades and a few ammo-less pistols. Watch out though, they also contain explosive barrels, dishwashers, stoves and refrigerators! It's quite a site to see the man running in front of you being squashed by a stove! There's also a neat little secret near the bottom of the hill for CT's that could very well solidify your victory.\r\n\r\nSmoke grenade placement and teamwork get the CT's safely down the hill, but getting to the grenade room doesn't guarantee their victory. Good luck!"
