Players start with no weapons, and depending on how well they surf, they will get better weapons. <b>It is suggested that you do not run this on a DM server, as a lot of the functions were made specifically for a normal surf. We have a DM version in the works, and it should be out sometime soon.</b> \r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n<b>This map was made specifically for 66tick.
