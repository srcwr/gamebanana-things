	"_sText": "Cheetah = Mapper\r\nGangster = got the idea\r\nIt's like a remake of Breakfloor, but with more Secrets and in texture style.\r\nIn the Spawn theres a glass, which breaks with 3000 Damage. If you are down in the water, you can open the door with a little secret (go to each corner, begin with the corner, which is on the left from the door). On picture 3 you see the secret to the first admin room, you have to break the \"crosshair\", behind the crosshair is an invisible button, press it and fall down. You can see  the first admin room on the last picture. If you want to go to the second admin room, you have to press 3 buttons, first near jail, near the beam, second is in the top, the first in a corner in the first admin room. You can see the second admin room on picture 7. In the top theres a room, you can play there he_tennis. The little boxes in the air gives you a he_grenade. Enjoy!"
