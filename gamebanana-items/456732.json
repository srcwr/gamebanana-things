I got some inspiration from other t8/9 trikz maps. It took me a few months to get the final version. I lost motivation many times during this hammer battle. I hope you guys have fun with this map!<br><br>Thanks a lot to everyone who helped testing and finding bugs (If I missed someone, please tell me). And if you find any bugs, please let me know too!<br><br>"
