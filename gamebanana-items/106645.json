I'm not really sure if this map qualifies an \"aim\" map but I didn't know what to name it.\r\n\r\nTheres 40 spawn points and for fun I hid 5 bananas within the map as an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1klLTb1rbE\">easter egg</a>.\r\n\r\nIt's not that fancy of a map. Just something to get me back into mapping as it's been a while since my last release. I made a nav file although it's not that great haha. Anyway I hope you gentlemen enjoy it. \r\n\r\n<i> I would have put in hdr to pretty up the map but apparently I can't play CS:S with DirectX9.0 graphics anymore :S\r\nI changed it to \"mat_dxlevel 81\" (so I could play online again with out my computer dying.) and when I changed it back to build cubemaps on hdr I was getting like, 1 frame per 20 seconds because my PC is amazing like that.\r\n</i>"
