	"_sText": "You love to play HE tennis, but you are bored by uninspired, stupid maps? \r\nThen check he_tennis_ultimate! Created by the self-appointed world's leading he tennis player it brings you the ultimate HE action.The tricky match field, illuminated by fancy spot lights, is based in a flossy storage depot and split into two zones. Terrorist forces start in the red zone whereas counter-terrorist forces fight from the blue zone. Well positioned gaps within and around the transparent tennis net, which is made from steel bars and glas blocks , as well as 3-dimensionally arranged bouncing boards offer a vast range of possibilities to throw the grenades through it or against them respectively. \r\nUnlike conventional HE tennis maps all grenades are immediatly available right from the start of each match and spread around the ground of the two zones. Vertically oriented glas panels within the zones may protect you from frontal attacks, but always keep watching your enemy's grenades - they can hit you from any direction. This map is the ultimate fun and requires all your aiming skills. Just try. Your are welcome to send me your feedback. Mr. Jiggs"
