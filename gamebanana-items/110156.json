	"_sText": "Hi Im Carl AKA Bov, the creator of this map. I made this map as a remake of the Land of living dead map called Cage. There is two teams the are fighting against each other to the death. The map is supposed to have a horrorish look and hopefully a cool feeling.\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple. In a world that has fallen apart and the law is dust in the wind, you get captured by the gang called \"The mist\". You get taken to a cage arena and there you have to fight in a team against other captured humans. If someone refuse to fight that person will get totured to death.\r\n\r\nBefore the match you get a knife and then the gates open. A bloody fight takes place and many lives will get wasted in this night of fear...\r\n\r\nWell, if you want to contact me just add \"grollo_2000@hotmail.com\" at msn or \"fezzex\" at xfire.\r\nAnd mabey if you want your own map just ask my. I'll be glad to make a map for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee you in the cage // Carl AKA Bov"
