Small and fast paced, but with plenty of options to get to either of the 2 bombs sites. As always I hope you enjoy playing on this map as much as I did in creating it.<br>\r\n<br>Couple of small places, some transitions and underground parking... it will be difficult to get lost! :-) Radar and Navigation Mesh for Bots in existence.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Happy Frags and Good Luck!"
