It's just simply an AIM map right now.\r\nBut, once I'm done with this map, I plan on making a de_ (maybe cs_) version of it as well.\r\n\r\n<b> Actual Known Problems </b>\r\n1. Men's bathroom near CT Spawn has a section of a wall that I accidently NoDrawed.\r\n2. Ladders/Carved holes are a bitch to get in and out of.\r\n\r\n<b> Auto To/Do's </b>\r\nLighting is quite...dull...But take this one and hold it up against my first map (<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/20279\" target=\"_blank\">seb_deathbox</a>). It looks quite lovely, and much more lively. But still, I'm going to try to tweak the settings to make it look much better. \r\n\r\nI want to fix those ladders/holes. You can get through them, but sometimes they like to snag you.\r\n\r\nSome areas of the map don't really make me feel like it's \"complete\". So I plan on adding more models.\r\n\r\n<b> Help...Please </b>\r\nAside from telling me that it sucks, I would really like some help for future reference. As I'm a beginner to this and would like to learn as much as possible about this program.\r\n\r\nI would like to know how to add Place names. I followed the tut found on this site, but it didn't tell me how to add any.\r\n\r\nIs there any custom models/textures/decal sites out there?\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, thanks for trying my map.\r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments?\r\nEmail me at sebhael AT hotmail DOT com\r\nor just use FPSB's PM system.\r\n\r\n"
