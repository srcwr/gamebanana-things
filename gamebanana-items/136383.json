Before starting to learn Source mapping about three or four weeks ago, the last maps I'd ever made were for the game Duke Nukem 3D almost 10 years ago!\r\n\r\nI've tried to make this map balanced, flowing, and fun for Gun Game and Deathmatch style servers, while keeping an air of ambiance and originality!\r\n\r\nI hope you like my creation and have fun playing it! It's been a very fun project that has re-awoken a love for art and design I haven't experienced in ages!\r\n\r\nVery special thanks goes to everyone who helped me get a solid grasp on Hammer over the last few weeks, and to my friends who play-tested and offered their valuable feedback! Here's to you FPSBanana, Edit Life, Interlopers, plus DNVCross and the rest of the guys from the strafeRight.com crew!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
