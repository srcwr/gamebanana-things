	"_sText": "This map is like a futuristic community. It is a small section of a huge city that uses an irrigation system to supply each section with water. This section just happens to be on the delta of the river, thus the name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I was not trying to capture a realistic look of a building. As I said before it was kind of \"futuristic\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE 7/10\r\nI added some more props all around, such as bushes of different types, to more models in the market. I also added street lamps arpund the place to add to the maps atmosphere\r\n\r\nUPDATE 7/21\r\nSo the map is finally done. I optimized a bunch, fixed framerate problems, and 3d skyboxed."
