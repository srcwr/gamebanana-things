The purpose we named it spacebar is because after playing it, you will realize that your life depends heavily on how quickly u can tap your spacebar.\r\n\r\nThere is a map_config of 200 gravity in the .zip, and both spawn areas have a large ramp that shoots the player hurling through the air to wherever they want. \r\n\r\nFor those wondering, this was originally a gg_ map but we felt it would be more widley used if converted to an fy_ map, but none the less, it still does work fine with gungame.\r\nThis has actually become quite popular on our Gun Game server @ 72.232.81.85:27015\r\nThe Candy Shoppe :: GUN GAME v3 | FastMapDL | Bullettime\r\n\r\nthis map uses buy zones, but i reccomend using the shotgun.\r\n\r\n"
