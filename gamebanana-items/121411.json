	"_sText": "Both teams start in a small area with only a hole where they can shoot through to gain headshots. There are always some players that like to ruin the fun for other people. In my map they can duck so that they can't be hit and so that the round keeps continuing. 50 seconds after the round has started a button will be available to both the teams that breaks the wall where they can shoot through. Walking past it will teleport the player to upstairs. The player can then walk to the opposite side and kill the camping player by shooting through the glass. \r\n\r\ni hope you understand what i just wrote (sorry for my crappy english)"
