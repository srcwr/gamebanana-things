	"_sText": "A small map that I tossed together, more or less to practice teleporting. Fairly fast gameplay. 20 seconds after the round start, the outer force field will break. Only autosnipers and AWPs can shoot through the forcefields dividing the map, as well as through the forcefield floor of the upper deck. To shut down the dividing fields, destroy the octagon hovering in the middle of the upper deck. Other than the forcefield and the skybox, all textures are custom made by me (I know, reflective black and white aren't exactly impressive :|). The skybox is mpa61 made by Rumplebude.\r\n\r\nJump off the map. I dare you to.\r\n\r\nThe cubemaps look terrible in the reflections in GMod (which I used for the screenshots) but they seem to look much better in CS:S. Also, I play with really low settings, so they could actually look a lot better than they do in the screenies. *Shrug*"
