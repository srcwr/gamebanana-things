Since then I have added to it and made it look nicer. Might not be the best map gameplay wise, in fact it'll probably need about 20 or so people to make it fun. Bots just jump into space as well. Serves me right for making something a little different.\r\n\r\nIt's a nice map to walk around, give it a go and see what you think. Please :)\r\n\r\nHere's a nice little video of it.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-k6A56bE7lU&hl=en\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-k6A56bE7lU&hl=en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n"
