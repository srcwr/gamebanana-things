I never planned to release it, but since it turned out pretty good I decided that there maybe was someone out there who would like it! \r\nHowever since I never planned on releasing it I never made the layout of the map \"optimizable\" so I spent some time trying to figure out how I could make it more fps-friendly.\r\n\r\nNow, you may be wondering why this is a beta, since it looks complete in the screenshots. Well the reason is I havn't had a chance to test the gameplay of it with ZombieMod. So what I want from you is alot of feedback and ideas on the gameplay of the map! This is my first ZM map so I have probably done some really noobish things with the barricades or something, so tell me if I have. \r\nOfcourse, if you find any bugs or other things that ruin the map, tell me that aswell!\r\n\r\nThe map is complete with Cubemaps, Playerclips, Soundscapes and all that good stuff. Theres even 64 spawns in it, even though I personaly think 64 players on this map is madness.\r\nThis map also features Color Correction, so make sure you have it enabled in your video options since it makes the map look over 9000 times better!\r\ni havn't added a radar overview in this beta, but I will in the final version if you think so.\r\n\r\nSo you don't really need to do any assesments or anything like that just yet. When I am sure the gameplay of it is Ok, I will set the map to Final and you can use it on your servers if you feel like it.\r\n\r\n---DOWNLOAD FINAL VERSION HERE---\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/131124\r\n"
