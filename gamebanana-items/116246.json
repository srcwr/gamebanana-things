I was already thinking in make a map of the LHC, but nothing estimulated me until I enter this contest.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the final version of my map. Even it being for CS:S, it only supports 1 player. New sounds were added, as well as new effects and the player is now teleported to a different location. And this time he doesn't die (well, not during the sequence :D).\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy it and that level designers get more interested in joining contests like this. We are not here for points or money. We are here to make fun."
