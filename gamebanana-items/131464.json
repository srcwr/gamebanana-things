You will find all the secrets eventualy. As you can see there are some areas where you can let someone up but you cant go up yourself. this is to control the population of the people in each area. Enjoy. <CC>< Mr 3000\r\n\r\nIf you would like to send me requests you can send me an e-mail at Runny123@gmail.com \r\n\r\nCredits go to the person who made this map. I just re-edited it for zm\r\n\r\n"
