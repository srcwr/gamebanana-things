This is my first experience, so there are errors in the design of passages and rooms. <br>When testing, the gameplay takes around 15 minutes. <br>In a single game, the map did not cause problems, but when porting to the friends' server, the map stopped working in different places, then the teleport did not teleport everyone, then the boss did not activate, I will hope that these were problems only with that server. <br><br>What was implemented:<br><ul><li>Warm-up round at the first start.</li><li>Smooth transitions between locations.<br></li><li>Musical accompaniment.<br></li><li>Text support of the passage.<br></li><li>Puzzles for opening passages.<br></li><li>Matter for people in the form of a first aid kit.<br></li><li>Laser testing.<br></li><li class=\"SelectedElement\">Arena and boss battle.</li></ul><br>I am waiting for your feedback.<br>"
