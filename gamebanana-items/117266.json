Never got around to uploading it anywhere.\r\n\r\nNot sure who made the original crackhouse, but credits to them for making a cool deathmatch map. Only things I did to it was add the snow on the ground, falling snow, christmas tree, snowman, and removed the hostages. (For infinate playtime on deathmatch servers)"
