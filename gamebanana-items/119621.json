	"_sText": "This is my second attempt at this map here is a link to the first <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/56552\">Combine Battle Ground</a>. I will be releasing a final version within a month or so, I would appreciate feed back so I know what to start on for the final version.\r\n<hr>\r\n<font color=\"yellow\">Description:</font> \r\n\r\nFor the Most part the layout is the same as the first map <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/56552\">Combine Battle Ground</a> but there are some changes. In general the map is lighter, there is fog, and the map is more wide. \r\n\r\nOn the top floor there There is a large median that seperates the left and right. you can get on top of the median and go to the left and right sides where it wings out. there is also 2 small rooms on each side(left and right) that can be used as cover aswell as the many crates.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom floor it is much darker and more open. Most of the cover is near the enterances to the bottom floor. In the middle there is no cover, because it's the darkest part of the map. This allows some stealth.\r\n<hr>\r\nAs far as credits go I'm the only one who work on this map and I used source sdk.\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\">*Note:\r\nDo not copy, modify, or redistribute this map, without author consent*</font>"
