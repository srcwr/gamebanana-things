There are about 11 or so traps, and a couple of new ideas. This map stays true to its name 'illusions' where, at the end of the map, there is an illusion maze that the opposing team will have to navigate though. Then comes the tricky part. The trappers will get to choose the course of the maze. Here, is a choice of three buttons which all create a separate path route for the other team to take a chance and cross.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\nThanks goes out to:\r\nPuni\r\nMani\r\nRyan\r\nSintax Error \r\nRoosta \r\nTarget Pratice \r\n_________________________________\r\n\r\nTake a look @ DestructiveStudio.info\r\nVisit: mapjunkies.com\r\n__________________________________"
