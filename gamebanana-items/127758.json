The weapon order is; knife, glock, deagle, mp5, ak47, awp. \r\n\r\nUPDATES\r\n- Fixed the \"Top\" glitch.\r\n- Made it so guns can't be spammed.\r\n- Made and \"AFK Killer\"\r\n- Made a \"Kill Button\"\r\n\r\nUPDATES for V3\r\n- Made it so more than one person can be on bhop platform  at a time.\r\n- Fixed it so you can't shoot each other through the boxes after failing."
