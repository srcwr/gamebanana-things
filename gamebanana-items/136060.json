	"_sText": "About: gg_outlined_v2\r\nFocused around one large building, a path around to each spawn blocked by a wall you must climb. Two ladders go straight to the top floor but place you out in the open. A Ramp on either side also makes a path to the top. 4 small bunker/buildings are positioned in a cross atop. Inside the main building is a block with paths each way around it and over it. There is a hole in the ceiling to allow dropping down to the bottom floor. Can also be used for knife arena if you don't think its to big, no buyzone.\r\n\r\nCredits: Still, i made this map but i give credit to \r\nhamster for his/her \"hamsters tile pack\"\r\nmekaonija for his/her \"Color Pack\"\r\n\r\nEven tho i did not use their textures, i tried with gg_outlined_v2 but i was extremly confused by pakrat and unless someone embeds the textures for me this will take over.\r\nPlease make a comment and dl. This is all DEV texture so it should be awsome, still looks pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to see the original here it is http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/56123 many have commented TY SO MUCH."
