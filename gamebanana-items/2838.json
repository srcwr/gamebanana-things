Good for someone new to stairs is all.\r\n\r\nExtract stairsnrails.vmf to your ' Steam/steamapps/youraccount/sourcesdk_content/cstrike/mapsrc/prefabs ' folder. If you don't have a prefab folder create one. Now you can open the file from the prefabs folder in the same location as all of your maps you've created.\r\n\r\nYou can use this for anything would be nice to credit me, don't forget to tools/nodraw all of your selections before retexturing!"
