Give me feedback on my map's page, thanks. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation: Unzip to Program Files->Steam->Steapapps-><Yourusername>Counter-strike Source->Cstrike->Maps\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nI'd also like to add. The MAXIMUM players possible is 12, 6 per team. I did it like this to accomodate various people's ideas. Some may think that the map is good for 6 per team, and whatever. So I put 12 spawn points, just to give people the option.\r\n\r\nAlso, though this server is for 1v1, it can also hold 2v2 and possibly even 3v3 for the same kind of idea, very well.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think, thanks for viewing :)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnarchyUK"
