Three ways to get into the house: sewer, main entrance, and jumping on the crates at the side of the balcony to get to the second floor.\r\n\r\nAlot more FPS in v2, darkened lamps, added sewer, blocked tunnel.\r\n\r\nHostages can't enter the sewer. I tried fixing it, but then they just get to the end of the sewer and run back to the house because they don't like ladders."
