	"_sText": "This is a texture map made with cell shading. I don't know what the gameplay on this map will be like, so if you add it to your gg server please tell me the IP. I know about some of the textures being backwards but I originally did that so the map was less repetitive. Buy zones are included if you want to test without GG but I wasn't able to do a nav for it even custom making it.\r\n\r\nThanks, drimp"
