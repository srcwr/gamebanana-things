	"_sText": "This map started out with a simple idea and quickly got out of hand. It is most fun played in deathmatch setting. I really enjoyed creating certain aspects of this map. I should mention it is my first attempt at this.\r\n\r\nI personally love the feel and overall darkness to it but realize some may have a hard time seeing everything at times. I recommend nightvision! Also if I get enough requests I am willing to make a daytime version..\r\n\r\nFeedback would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
