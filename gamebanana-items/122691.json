Same as before... \"Simple map, really. You are able to gain new weapons on each ramp/level of the tower. If you want the new weapon be sure to drop your old one. I tested this map with the settings from the surf server I frequent, Lobster Man's Surf-n-Turf. There is a spot to get an m249, it's just a little out of the way.\""
