	"_sText": "**Updated to v3b. Major update, including more secrets, retex'ing, new stuff, and more and stronger lights for the full effect. Try it!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: THIS MAP IS NOW V3. I HAVE ADDED LIGHTS, AND MADE SMALL CHANGES OVERALL.\r\nThis map features:\r\n-Two spawns in separate rooms. Spawnkilling is impossible, and spawncamping is idiotic.\r\n-A big main room with ramps and stuff.\r\n-Jail, where you end up if you fail the surfing. Located in the main room.\r\n-The pro way, where the surfing is harder, but if you make it, you can teleport yourself to the uberjail, where you can either kill the prisoners, release them, or slay them with various entertaining methods.\r\n- A chopper to fly around in.\r\n-There's also secrets, ofcourse, but if i posted em here, they wouldn't be secrets anymore, no?\r\n\r\nThis is the final version. If you find bugs, or do you have ideas for my map, tell me. I won't promise i'll answer quickly, though, as I'm not often online here at FPSB. Instead, try posting it at eni-community.org, where I'm online pretty much every day.\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\ng-flow for the skybox\r\nUMBRELLAJackson for the chopper\r\nThe rest i made myself.\r\nEnjoy my map!\r\n\r\nGreets, Paragon."
