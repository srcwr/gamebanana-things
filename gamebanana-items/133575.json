On Here would be an exellent sniping point. Good Luck And Have Fun.\r\n\r\n<h1> <font color=red> Credits and Notes </font> </h1>\r\n\r\n**Note** Bots Dont Function properley on this map because when they come under combat they run off of the bridge. They Do Work but just somtimes. its just not recomended.\r\n\r\n<font color=blue> Thank You For reading this and viewing the map. please comment and assess this map and if you happen to give me a low score (bellow 5/10) please post a valid reason. thank you\r\n\r\n<h1> Here is a small video </h1>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"373\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/SQBQGBSa0oM&rel=1&border=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/SQBQGBSa0oM&rel=1&border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"373\"></embed></object>"
