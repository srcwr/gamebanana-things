It's a nice downtown with a bank, a gas station, a movie theater, and a lot more.\n\nTerrorists are trying to explode the city hall. Disable the bomb and kill all those bastards to save the day.\n\nSpawn Points: 64\n\nThanks to:\n\nA special thanks to the guys at ICC server, specialy Sandfly. This project would not be possible, with this quality, without you guys."
