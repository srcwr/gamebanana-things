After 3 seconds the box will break and you will be able to skate. It is recommended that you dont jump or duck while in the box because you might end up not hitting the boost on the ground properly.\r\nIn the center of the map you will find a flashbang which will respawn every 10 seconds.\r\nAfter 2 minutes you will be unable to iceskate and will have to walk normally, this is so the round doesnt last too long.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCustom skybox by Karatekaefer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy!"
