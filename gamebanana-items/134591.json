	"_sText": "This is the re-made ver. of my 1st map (gg_texture_clan-war). Non texture theme, converted to inner warehouse lot theme. Walls and props to hide around.  (Cars, Tires, Boxes, Barrels and dead hosties). Now the upper level can be broken down (2 times). Shoot out pillers in lower mid section to drop 3rd floor, then shoot 3rd floor clear out leaving just the dodge walls on the floor and a nice sky view. Fixed lighting. Hope to be a hit, possibly making a fy and dm ver. of this map"
