	"_sText": "The layout idea of the map is that the facility is an old worn down naval base. The submarine (custom model by Frenzy) is based on the UK nuclear submarine Astute. The submarine is bombsite A (as in astute) and in the underground trainyard bombsite B is located. We have tried to make the map from a tactical point of view and from beta testing found it quite a challenge for both teams, once you know the map well enough.  There are 20 spawn points available for each team. We have found that the map easily holds 10 players on each team. We have tried to play around with light and sound to create a fitting mood for the map.\r\n\r\nThe major change from the Beta version of the map is a new route to the side of the ramp leading to Astute with access from the lower level via a security door.  This was done to help encourage the T's to attack Astute.  The train yard was also modified to make it easier to defend.  A number of changes have also been made to help frame rates in the sub room.\r\n\r\nOverview and Nav file is included in the BSP as well as all custom props, decals, textures etc.\r\n"
