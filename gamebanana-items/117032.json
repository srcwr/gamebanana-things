Most windows/surfaces in the map are bump mapped using env_cubemap.\r\n_____\r\nTHANKS:\r\nSpawnZlive - Mapping/Testing\r\nViper - Testing\r\nJack Bullet Proof J.B.P - Testing\r\n_____\r\nSpecial Notes:\r\nThis is my first map ever completed. I do not want you to \"take it easy\" on me, if you have some criticism, let me hear it.\r\nAlso, any comments you have are greatly appreaciated.\r\nYou can e-mail me with suggestions/questions/comments at: zachhousedoc1@aol.com\r\n_____\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n"
