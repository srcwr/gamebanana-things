There are loads of games to play like: Volley ball, a maze, Rockclimb and many more! Plus there are also many places that players not playing can spectate from! ENJOY! Also special thankz to .doM for help during the mapping period.\r\n\r\nCheerz, Raffa.\r\n\r\np.s There was a glich for one of the cell buttons. I fixed it and it should work well now! "
