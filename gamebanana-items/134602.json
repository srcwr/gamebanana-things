There are 3 routes to get from T to CT. There is a quake like jump in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots really don't do this map justice, you have to play it to the get entire atmosphere.\r\n\r\ninstructions for the jump in the center:\r\n- if you walk onto it you'll float across\r\n- if you jump on it you will fall down to the floor below.\r\n- if you jump from the basement you will be lifted to the floor above."
