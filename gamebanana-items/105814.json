To keep things interesting there is a tunnel running under the battlefield from one side to the other. Watch out for sneaky players trying to get the jump on you.\r\n\r\nSmokes are recommended if you are trying to cross the barren middle of the map.  Be sure to buy your sniper weapons early and often... you will need them!    \r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\n=========\r\nThanks to the JGC Clan for their support. "
