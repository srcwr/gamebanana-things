	"_sText": "A small arena project I made in a few days. There are 4 jump pads around the map, boosts on central circular ramp, auto-open jail system every 15 seconds, 32 spawn points and 1 small easter egg.\r\n\r\nAny bugs, please PM me, any sugestions, please leave them below, and please assess. I would like to know your opinion and I'm open to any criticism.\r\n\r\nThank you and enjoy.\r\n\r\nNote: I had an HDR version but even a tiny amount of bloom made the surfing annoying. If people are interested I can post it."
