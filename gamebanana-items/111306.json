	"_sText": "This is a fy-map. The CT's and the T's spawn on opposite sides of the map, where there is several weapons with full ammo. There is a middle section, two side sections and you can also climb up on the roof. The middle section consists of one straight corridor, blocked by several breakable walls. Inside this corridor, there is also two glass walls separating you from two small rooms which you can only access by jumping through the windows from the two side sections. The side sections consists of straight corridors, but here you can see all over to the other side when you go past the thin, arced walls that are meant for taking cover when crossing the corridor. I have also placed a small sniping platform (with only scouts available on it) which is accessable by jumping down the hole located in the center of the middle corridor. Hope you will enjoy this map :P\r\n\r\nI made this map very long ago, but i found it in the maps archives of my old pc and decided to finish it and submit it. And btw it's not detailed, as i made this map years ago and it's one of my first maps."
