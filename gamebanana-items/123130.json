	"_sText": "At spawn it is IMPOSSIBLE to hit an enemy through the nearly invisible wall. Incase it looks weird to you, you are pushed very quickly down the first ramps when you don't expect it which makes it impossible to spawn attack/kill/hop. You fly down the first series of ramps, then you have to land on one of the green rectangles, then you have to do a long surf, curl up to a higher ramp and out a little hole. This then takes you to a falling room which is impossible to do if you don't just jump over all the boxes =)\r\n\r\nThen you get to the top of jail with LOADS of guns and he grenades, and you can go back to the other rooms to hunt people.\r\n\r\nThere is a slow spawn pusher which pushes AFKzors so they don't just be stuck there and use up all the round time!\r\n\r\n****Recommended CVars:****\r\n\r\n**sv_airaccelerate 1000**\r\n\r\nNo other files are required, just the map."
