	"_sText": "Well this is the new version of this map. There are a few secret rooms if you can find them. There is also 3 working elevators and a back stairway in case the security lockout is engaged. Also for the elevators, up is \"s\" and down is \"w\".\r\n\r\nAlso, by request, you can get on the roof of the courtyard and the secret room with the monitors isn't as cheap anymore. 2 ways to get into that area. Also the elevator shafts are fixed along with the vents. There are now boxes to get up if security is enabled.\r\n\r\nAnother update is the lighting. The street lights are updated, more realistic with the lighting. Also there is now 2 more rooms along the stairs and there is also there is another secret room. The security room is now updated so you don't get stuck in the teleporter and it is bigger now. Also there is now a train station and it has a few extra rooms down there.\r\n\r\nThe outside area is updated and has one of those combine outpost things. Also there is an added trap over there. More rooms/ updates to come in the final.\r\n\r\nBTW nav file uses old version. No problems known with it, but in the final it will be updated. Also B3 was skipped since testing was local.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n"
