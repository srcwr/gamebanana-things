If you hurt him he will die. \r\n\r\n4º  Go again to take other granait and avoid the enemy´s grenades with jumps and fast movements.\r\n(Whatch out! the grenades can ricochet from the walls).\r\n\r\nOther notes: \r\n\r\n-> Dont worry about the lag of  the smoke because the grenades will fall in room that is down the floor. And grenades can across the glass of the middle.\r\n\r\n-> At 60\" form the start of the round, the glass of the middle will break and you will be able to use the knife too.\r\n\r\n-> Players will respawn with a knife and they can take smoke grenades.\r\n\r\n"
