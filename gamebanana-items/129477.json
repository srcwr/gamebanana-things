There is a button on the wall of each cell, when the button is pressed, the floor of the cell breaks causing the person inside to fall into \"hell\". The floor will only break once the door of the glass cell has been opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map is not to be edited. Please do not copy things out of this level and implement them into yours. You may decompile this map only to see how certain things were done."
