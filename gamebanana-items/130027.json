It gave me quite some headaches to finish it but I was happy that I did. Hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it (cough).\r\n\r\nThis map was created for the portuguese FRAGXL community.\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>MAP INFO</legend>Type: Rally Race\r\nPlayers: 16 max.\r\n\r\n- Earthquake\r\n- HDR lightning\r\n- 3D skybox\r\n- Sunny weather\r\n- Crazy ramps\r\n- 2 Laps\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend>SCREENSHOT INFO</legend>Screenshot 1 - Start Zone\r\nScreenshot 2 - Map overview\r\nScreenshot 3 - The zig-zag turns\r\nScreenshot 4 - The famous Spiral Ramp\r\nScreenshot 5 - The gap\r\nScreenshot 6 - The booths\r\n</fieldset>\r\nIf you want to post this map on other forums go ahead but give me credit for my own map.
