	"_sText": "This is the beta version of my upcomming map, but it is still a great map. Unlike other DE maps this one only has one bombsite, but a second one will be added in the final version. \r\n\r\nThere are lots of hiding places and flanking routes (through the vents among other places) while the map still remains quite small with alot of intense fighting. Over its development the map has been playtested alot with up to 8 people and is quite balanced. It also works just fine when playing against bots, although they can not use vents at the time being and thier tactics are fairly limited.\r\n\r\n**Please try it / rate it and any feedback would be appreciated!**\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I am currently working on a much improved version of this map for CSGO, with two bombsites and with more than half of the areas completely redesigned. Feedback on this map is still apprecitated though!"
