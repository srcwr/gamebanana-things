The CT's spawn on top of the Tower, they aren't able to buy anything, they have to destroy the glass to the weaponchamber, otherwise, the terrorists will come and shoot them down. ;) This was made extra - because some Funny Guys would buy awp (there are 3 of it in the map, hidden) and shoot the terrorist down while they try to get up. \r\n\r\nIn the Tower ther is a huge Stair, of course, good for the counterterrorist, to shoot, but T's can buy, don't forget.. ;) And if AWP isn't restricted... good luck, camper. :D\r\n\r\nIn the next Version of the map, there will be an lift like in mg_tower to give an third way to climb the tower (or come safe down.. whatever)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<center>RLS NOTES\r\n\r\nv1 - just that, what you see... ;)\r\n</center>\r\n\r\nMap by k1Ng aLca\r\n\r\nSome credits goes to:\r\nSkar\r\ncR0x\r\nMy Clan\r\nLoH Fungame Server\r\nMachineZ (because he helps me to learn mapping... ^^\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://img3.imagebanana.com/view/dxzsjd7/yeah.png\">mg_stairways</a>\r\nlook, what i have found..
