	"_sText": "The last hope for Mankind from the Zombie Apocalypse is a tower, miles away from civilization, holding the last and only available quarantine pod. As our survivors attempt to escape to this trap filled monument the zombies attempt to catch them and crush what last hopes they have. Now the only thing standing between the humans and salvation is a nightmarish deathtrap of chicken themes and fatal obstacles.\r\n\r\nProbably my first actual map made for Source. Kudos to Westsid3r's nuke prefab and Kilpix3r's video tutorials that helped drag me through the map making process. Map was finished on April 1st 2010 by The_Chicken_Lord for use on any server that downloads it\r\n\r\n***Missing Textures have been fixed***"
