Just extract it into your Counter-Strike: Source directory. Hopefully somebody enjoys it ;)\r\n \r\n\r\n---------------\r\nMINI GARDEN\r\n===============\r\n\r\nA small garden located in rural England has become the center of a counter-terrorism situation. Several nuclear waste containers have been located under the garden. Terrorists have crashed into the back of the garden preparing to destroy critical structural points that will expose radiation causing death for millions all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrorists : Plant the bomb at either the greenhouse or the pergola.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists : Kill the terrorists without hesitation. Must stop detonation of bomb at all costs!\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nMapping :\r\nnutcrackr\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nMap Completed February 2007\r\nContact :\r\nthomm0@hotmail.com\r\n"
