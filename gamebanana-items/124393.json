HaHa... \r\n\r\nThe fixes in v2_fix:\r\n\r\n- Changed the speed og the blocks to 30 and made them thinner and changed the delay from 1 to 0.5 ( and i promise you, they will spawn much faster now (thanks for the hint))\r\n- Removed a few props like the long sound file at the end, the trigger explosion (only the one in jail has survived), deleted the sparkles on the laser and removed 1 of the lasers.\r\n- Changed the brightness of light (and yes, i prefer it that way too (thanks)).\r\n\r\nWell now the map should be playable again without complains (exept the long map name :/)\r\n\r\n----------Original v2 post below-------------\r\n\r\nAlright ive made a Version 2 of this map to improve some stuf and make it more fun xD\r\n\r\nImprovements in V2:\r\n\r\n- Changed the speed on the boxes from 25 to 35.\r\n- Fixed the light in the map, so its not just stuck brightness.\r\n- Made alot of objects into func_detail enitities.\r\n- Added a few models to give more life to it.\r\n- I made some funny options/abilities for those who complete the map. Such as, play sound, trigger explosions (to scare the noobs), lightning On/Off at the end, more weapons (elite gun with full ammo)\r\n\r\nI hope you guys like my map now. I really think its pretty fun and i would love to test this map on a server with players on it.\r\n\r\n----------Original post below-------------\r\n\r\nWell this is my 2nd bhop map... \r\n\r\nIts not so long, but its a pretty funny map i think..\r\n\r\nMap created by me.\r\nCustom textures created by me.\r\nOriginal texture by Valve (i think :/ ) \r\nOriginal models by valve ------ll------\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\nPls tell me what you think about it and how difficult you think it is.\r\n( hopefully i have added the textures right this time )"
