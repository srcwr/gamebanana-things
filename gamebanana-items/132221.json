Touch right side of the top-right wheel of the flipped track, it's a teleport to my name (see picture 2)\r\n2. On top of my name run to the C of CoMaNdO and jump forward - It'll teleport you to the roof, the roof has a few controls to block that teleport and a few more secrets. (Note that blocking the teleport still lets zombies pass if they jump on top of each other)\r\n \r\nThis is not the best map that I've made, and I pretty much quit mapping, I guess I will create new maps / mod maps once in a while but as of right now I am modding maps through mods (Using SourceMod)"
