Thank you for volunteering to participate in this Aperture Laboratories Experiment. Please take the Arctic Warfare Magnum to your left and press the button in front of you when you are ready.\r\n\r\nThere will be cake...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a single player target practice map. It consists of 9 targets, with varying time to shoot, distance, and location. To get pass each \"stage\" you must shoot each of the targets in that round of shooting (3 at a time). There are 9 targets and you have 10 shots, so be careful.\r\n\r\nExpect a multiplayer AWP map with a similar theme to come in the future.\r\n\r\n[The porting from portal has been fixed, the cake (and all other textures) is now a flat custom texture, not a ported model]"
