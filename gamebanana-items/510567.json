So what is next? crackhouse, and what will it mean, i will make remaster and be gone again BUT not for that long as last time. there are people that wanna see my work, first it was only for me and public was second option but i think i wanna have that small portion of fame even if its 2 fans or only me, i will be happy to make that thing and make the thing again but better and bigger. there will be alot of work and time, but thing i say i make it real because css community is so bad even blockstarplanet community seems better. remember that and i will be back</p>",
