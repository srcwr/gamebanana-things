In the end my measurements were\r\nway off in comparision to gg_churches_v2. gg_churches_remake is completely built up from scratch, obviously credit goes to the \r\noriginal author for the layout and design of the brushes that consume the map. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n===================================\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nGG_CHURCHES_V2: The original author, for the layout, design, and the time that author has spent into his/her map.\r\n\r\ngg_churches_remake: Dominic, for remaking gg_churches_v2 and ultimately making gg_churches a clean and more enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n====================================\r\n\r\nContact information: msnruler8@hotmail.com Please contact me if you have a question about the map, or how I created something. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOther maps:\r\ntrade_mannconomy_v5g\r\n\r\nany other map created by me was not a serious attempt at mapping.\r\n\r\nIf you actually read this, THANK YOU!"
