	"_sText": "<pre>Friends Jump is an 8 person collab started by Takzul, composed by Saspatoon. \r\nIt is overall a fairly lengthy map that gets more difficult as you go through it. There are 8 different stages by different people. The beginning of a stage is marked by a sign saying the maker of said stage. Some stages have teleports to other parts of the stage, you will know because you wont see a sign marking a new stage. Not possible on scroll without lots of legit assist.<br><br>\r\nThe map is roughly 30 minutes on average, however could be far faster given a better player.<br><br>\r\nStages:\r\n1: Abe\r\n2: Hai\r\n3: Founder\r\n4: Takzul\r\n5: Pcpie\r\n6: Saspatoon\r\n7: Fur\r\n8: A.NightWolf<br><br>\r\nTesting:\r\nA.NightWolf\r\ntonic\r\nJydus\r\nSixer\r\nSaspatoon\r\nTakzul<br><br>\r\nTextures: (GameBanana Usernames)\r\nTextures - Wolves Assault Hero\r\nTextures - xD.DuBsTeP.\r\nTextures - Acehigh\r\nTextures - silent assassin \r\nTextures - noclipper\r\nTextures - pcpie\r\nTextures - Dead Man Walker \r\nTextures - TopHATTwaffle\r\nTextures - Saspatoon\r\nTextures - FireWavezZ\r\nTextures - Skyppy</pre><pre>Took longer than expected because models kept being a problem turning black etc. Enjoy!</pre>"
