In this new version, FPS are usually between 50 and 80 on my computer (around the same as official map for me) instead of 20 to 50 before optimization.\r\nThere are still little freezing time but in the first round only. \r\nSpecial thanks to SoopaFly, DJ Bourgeoisie (cs/de_xcom, de_courthouse_final...), LDuke and PAF team (from http://www.punkassfraggers.com) for their help and all the time they have spent to optimized this map. Thanks too to Boxer82003 for testing!\r\n\r\nAction take place in a little village in italy, just before night. Counters have to rescue hostages which have been hidden in a little house by terrorists.\r\nThis is NOT a remake of cs_italy; it is a 100% new map made with part of cs_italy textures and style.\r\nYou can play up to 40 players.description"
