	"_sText": "This is really mostly a copy of textured city advanced with a ton of small changes. The most obvious is the retexturing, some are custom block textures I made myself, some are from ryan_dev, and the rest is just colored lighting. I did make some fun stuff, like breakable things (mostly windows), slightly enhanced ladder access, a few spots are just prettied up a bit. I thought this would be a great alternative to the standard crosshatch look to all the others (or the grey and orange, blegh).<br><br>Some notes:<i> skybox - I think this one was by KAMAOKC, but I'm not sure. I can't seem to find it again to give props. Same goes for the glass texture I used. I wish I kept better track of this stuff.</i>"
