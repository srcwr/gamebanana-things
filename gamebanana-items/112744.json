The fps are even better now and all the action is concentrated on top making this a good fy/aim combo,gg,dm map. \r\n\r\nIt features HDR lighting (toned down compared to the original), 40 player spawns, soundscapes, overview, optimized and tweaked nav file, custom content.\r\n\r\nI started making this the other day and then I saw that there's this contest going on so I thought to myself: Added bonus! :D\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n(Map's for CS:S)"
