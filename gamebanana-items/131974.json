	"_sText": "First off this is my first map and it's been a blast making it.  I decided to make a zombie map cause I play it a lot and I thought it would be easy to make something better then a lot of the ones currently played.  I wanted to accomplish great gameplay and also an attractive look.  I think I was succesful especially since it's my first try.  I hope you guys enjoy it.  There are many ways to play it and 1 secret room good luck finding it!\r\n\r\nComments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks: [Ao1]Something for helping me get started and answering my questions.  Also to the [Aura] clan for testing it out for me.  You can find me in the [Aura] clan server under [Aura]Ill knife ya!  Keep an eye out for my fy map that will be coming out soon!"
