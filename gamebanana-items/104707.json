	"_sText": "This is my fourth custom map but my first with a bomb defuse objective. It has been receiving excellent reviews in the couple days its been live on my server. Great map for both long distance sniping and close range carnage. Weapons on ground at spawn in addition to buy zones at both spawns and in middle section.\r\n\r\nAll polygons based on optimized dimensions to reach a very small download size. (only 1.6 meg unzipped)\r\n\r\nServerspy.net ranked my server #1 in Canada with much thanks to this map and my other customs. Look up -:{V!P}:- Cappys Playground 24/7 Iceworld to try this and my other customs out for yourself. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and be sure to let me know if it gets additional props when you run it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAl_Capwned (a.k.a Cappy)"
