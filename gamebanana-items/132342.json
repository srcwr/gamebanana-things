The energy barrier there can be passed by CT's only\r\n<br>- There is a vent that fills the pipe section with hot steam damaging all those campers down there\r\n<br>- You can shut down the reactor with a button in the small control room. Once shut down, the energy barrier at the pipe section vanishes\r\n<br><br>**Changelog**\r\n<br>b4: - Fixed the visibility bug (at the gate sealing the extra area)"
