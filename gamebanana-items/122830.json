I've started mapping again recently and decided to start by finishing this and releasing it.\r\n\r\nAll credit for the original surf goes to Archangel and Lethalis, their map was the one that I learned to surf on, and I wanted to do it justice by sticking as close to the original as possible.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy surfing it as much as I enjoyed remaking this classic."
