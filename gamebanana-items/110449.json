	"_sText": "<p style=\"color: YELLOW; font-size: large; text-align: center;\">Changes made since V2</p><p style=\"color: WHITE; font-size: small; text-align:left;\"><ul><li>Changed sunlight so that no shadow is cast over the pitch. Sunlight is now directly down. (Midday).</li><li>Changed \"Matt_\" credit from \"func_physbox\" to \"func_detail\" to stop it being brought onto the pitch.</li><li>Made pitch flat for the ball. Ball no longer gets effected by the pitch line paint. The lines are now \"func_illusionary\" entities and are non-solid to the player and the ball.</li><li>Fixed goal glitch where when used on some soccer mods, a goal could be scored by hitting the ball onto the top of the net.</li><li>Added \"ka_\" prefix to map name in order for the map to be more easily found in the server browser.</li></ul></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />Thnx to .:|GGA|:. Clan for testing the map for bugs, glitches, and needed fixes.\r\n\r\nInspired by Lolobubu's ka_soccer_2006<hr>"
