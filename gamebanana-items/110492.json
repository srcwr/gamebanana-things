	"_sText": "Here's a little map i made for fun, I had a Idea to make a map with two ramps and you get pushed forward and up, and all you have is a knife! basically, The T's and CT's both start on different sides. There's one platform with a scout on it, Then above that platform, There's a teleporter leading into a room where you can choose between a Awp, M4A1 Or a AK47! Then starting unloading rounds!\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nThere's a glitch in the map, Im aware of it. Where the pushes dont actully push you and you can just walk, I've tryed to fix it and got no where. If you do know how to fix this problem Please PM me.\r\n____________________\r\n\r\ncustom Textures By Icecreamlock and mekaonija.\r\nSkybox by Karatekaefer.\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nPlease test the map beore assessing it.\r\n_\r\nAlso, Map is best played with 600 gravity\r\n\r\nThx - \r\n    TDd"
