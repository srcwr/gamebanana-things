Would be an awsome map for DeathMatch (disable the weapons menu because I already have weapon distribution centers strategically placed around the map). If you contact me, you just might be able to figure out how to get my fully functional helicopter (it even has a kill button on the gas tank that will make the controls smoke, lose control, crash and explode)."
