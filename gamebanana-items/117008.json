I don't know if you could use it on a Gun Game server.\r\nIt is set up like a normal death match.   If you want to mod it to run on Gun Game server then fine.  Like I said,  I don't have any idea what the difference in the programming for gun game would be,  if any.  \r\n\r\nThis was the final version of the map,  or test map package that I put up.\r\nchupong2sky5fix2  was about the name in it.  Golden trees was a add on package that I had a hell of a time making work when I reinstalled game.\r\nSo I erased them and made it all stock!!"
