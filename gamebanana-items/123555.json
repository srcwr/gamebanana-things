	"_sText": "Lots of people say this is one of my best maps.  I'm very happy with it.  Initially I had troubles because I wanted all of the towers to be nicely rounded, but that ended up being too much for a map this size.  Initially I had poles going up the towers, but, despite their looking good, they were impossible to climb.  So I put in ladders, instead.  To prevent camping in the corner somewhere, the water drains your HP (except in the pools directly under the towers.)  Enjoy."
