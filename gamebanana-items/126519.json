I never intended it to be played on most servers, nor did Acer probably, as it's an experimental map and not natively bhop, but can still be played like a bhop map.<br><br>Most of these maps were never uploaded due to either laziness, or just unwillingness to do so, but are all playable. Most maps contained wherein are short, &lt;15 second maps, so keep that in mind before you dump them all onto your server if you dislike short, strafe maps.<br>Maps all ported or created by me, enjoy.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: If any of the original mappers has an issue with any of these maps being distributed freely to this website, contact me and I'll have the maps removed."
