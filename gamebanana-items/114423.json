There are connected with an long room. The map is the littlest ive ever made. Its very good to make aces and spraydowns in this map.\nBuyzones are available.\nLook at the screen's to see the map in its full bright ;).\n\nThe Credits and Special thanks (boring ^_^...)\n----------------------------------------------\nI used the standart Valve textures and the standart Valve Windows model.\nIf you have any suggestions or do you know what i can do better in this map? Write it down here and it do it immedialy! More comments, more versions! So:\n\nHAVE FUN WITH THIS MAP!\n=======================\n\nACTUAL VERSION: 1.0"
