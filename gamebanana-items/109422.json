	"_sText": "Basically this is a prison yard-ish map that for some unknown reason has lots of random objects in it. There are two building in which CT and T are spawned and these are connected by; the open yard, an upper corridor around the yard and an underground maze like thing. The two bomb sites are in the middle of the map but are either above or below the yard. The main action is in the middle where both teams meet the quickest. Snipers can view the yard and take position but must be careful as the other team are also at the vantage points. Overall this map leads to a even sided fight that provides opportunities and entertainment for each player.\r\n\r\nThanks go to v0la for the advice and testing of the map and to 3kliksphilip's helpful youtube videos."
