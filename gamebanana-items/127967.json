	"_sText": "This is my first map. CT's and T's start in the spawn room with no weapons, a player presses a button which slowly opens the gate giving time for the boulders to roll down, you make your way through three ramps with obstacles on which affect the boulders movement and the players mobility. At the top of the ramps there is a shotgun and a knife below a button that stops the boulders spawning, the player that got the top of the ramps first, gets to kill their in-game enemies and their team win the round. At the bottom of the ramps, the boulders will de-spawn, causing no lag.\r\n\r\nVersion 2:\r\n+ Added spawns that support up to 64 players.\r\n+ Added more scenery.\r\n+ Added secrets.\r\n+ Added more shotgun ammo (at the top)."
