One is on the top of bridge the other is on the catwalk just under the bridge. I did this so the whole bridge is used. By the pictures you can¡¦t see there is a door in each tunnel to get from top to catwalk faster. Other then jumping down, you can do this without killing yourself from both sides. \r\n\r\nI hope you like it...\r\n\r\n\r\nSkyBox Train By BsF|Cold14\r\nWebsite:\r\nhttp://www.gamebanana.com/members/136928\r\n\r\nWaterfall Texture By TopHATTwaffle\r\nWebsite:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQVvIV7oVJo\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2665"
