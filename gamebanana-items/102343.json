If you wish, you can change the music files to your liking, just name them music1, music2... music6. To toggle songs, press use key (default <E>) in front of the stereo.\r\n\r\nNote on the radar bug: If the radar does not appear, check the parameter cl_radaralpha, it must be set between 0 and 255 but by default is 1, which is almost Transparent. Adjust to 100 or more.\r\n\r\nNote on the effect of vegetation fade-out: The vegetation of the map fades out at a certain distance. To eliminate this effect, change the parameter cl_detaildist 1200 (default) to 3000.\r\n\r\nHave fun, and give me your feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is a video on the full version of the map:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bl53hkx2GPM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nHastal @ Vista"
