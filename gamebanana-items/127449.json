	"_sText": "Hey. I also added new ideas to the new map, which I invented for a short while, while there is inspiration. For many requests, I made a map that was not complicated, but pleasant in passing the levels. Passed several times personally by me on the timer, bugs are not found. Added the original bhop lvl also to the solo bonus, so in the main zone you do not accidentally enter the solo bonus.<br><br>Also, appreciate my old converted map: https://gamebanana.com/maps/167394, which I was able to restore and update, this card for many years, but an updated game for our days, so it's worth playing.<br><br><br>"
