(2005) \r\n\r\n\r\n ->  http://nppl.tv/scoreboard/mi05fields/nppl3d.jpg   <-\r\n\r\nthis is the first real speedball map i have seen.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend turning the sniper rifles off since both teams can see each other at spawn. \r\n\r\n\r\nTheres 26 spawns, but i don't recommend having 26 players. more like 14-20\r\n\r\nYOU CANT FALL OFF THE MAP THE EDGE IS THE SKYBOX!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
