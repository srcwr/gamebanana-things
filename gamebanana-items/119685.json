	"_sText": "ba_glass-stadium is the latest \"Battle Arena\" maps that began with ba_stadium.  This is my second, and veers a little \"crazier\" being a Glass Map, but oh man is it a great time.  \r\n\r\nThe overall jest is as follows.  You're in an abandoned factory that has been turned into a glass floored death factory.  You have 4 layers of glass, each having cover.  Kill your opponents with guns, or take their floor out from under them, it's your choice!  If you fall through, fear not, as long as you land in the water you'll get a second chance to take out your foes, as long as your quick, your health ticks away quickly.\r\n\r\nThis map was fun to make, fun to test, and it's fun to play.  If you're like me and like a change, you'll probably like this map, if you're a \"SERIOUS UBER CAL-I PLAYER\" don't be suprised if you hate it, besides I don't care.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the bots are jacked out on the map, however an updated/correct .nav file will be released later after I manually create it, making sure bots give good competition."
