	"_sText": "  Well cause I wasn't able to find enything like this I decided to create it :) This is my LED Board with sliding text. Inside the .rar archive you will find compiled map (example to show how everything works), prefab (includes all letters and numbers) and instructions how to use it ;)\r\n\r\n  Actualy after all the job was done I noticed that text could slide a lil bit faster but it's up to you to change that (it's easy but booooring :D cause you need to change lot of numbers)\r\n\r\n  So enjoy my work and I hope that you will like it :)\r\n\r\n  P.S. If you will use this prefab somewhere I would be glad to see some credits for me  ;)\r\n  P.S.S. Sorry for my poor english :p"
