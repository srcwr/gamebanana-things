This is the normal version of the map, intended to be played on regular servers, NOT TIMER SERVERS!\r\n\r\n**I WILL BE RELEASING AN _njv VERSION OF THE MAP SOON!** However if you think you can make it work yourself, go ahead.\r\n\r\nI've added one nifty little secret in, try and find it ;)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map! I sure as hell have enjoyed making and testing the map!\r\n\r\nMassive credits to everybody that's tested the map, given me feedback and everyone in general I play with :D\r\n\r\nIf you're interested at all, I would love to make a surf_ map collab with some other people, so add me on steam: **lordofboobs**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map :D"
