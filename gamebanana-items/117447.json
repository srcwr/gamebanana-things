There is also a sniping balcony that wraps around the map for those AWP lovers, though i made it fair for the other players by not providing a lot of sniper cover. If you find any bugs or think something could be improved, please comment on this map or PM me.\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\n[{GsH}] TheHuntzman"
