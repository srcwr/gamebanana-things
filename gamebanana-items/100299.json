The CT's start in the water and boats, while the T's spawn on the other side right by the bunkers. The whole objective is just kill the other team.\r\nThis is my second CSS map.\r\nTo install this map extract the .BSP file to go to your \r\nValve>Steam>SteamApps>*yourloginname*>counter-strike source>cstrike>maps folder\r\nI hope you like this map, it took a long time to do, I'm currently working on making trenches behind the bunkers so stay tuned if you want trenches!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
