I asked my friend to test this on a really shitty computer, and he got a minimum of 35 fps :P\r\nI guess thats what differs this from many other gg or fy maps out there. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHello everyone, and thanks for checking out my map! :D\r\n\r\nThis is the first map I am uploading, so if there's something you would like to me to know or change about the map, just post it in the comments.\r\n\r\nI made this map because I am tired of playing gungame, fightyard and aim on maps that isn't very detailed or realistic. \r\nHowever, this map is, (imo :P) and have put alot of effort into making it so.\r\n\r\nI couldn't really decide if this was a \"fy\", \"aim\" or \"gg\" map but I guess It can be used for any of them. \r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy this map as much as me and my friends did!\r\nHave fun and gimme lots of feedback!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSome features are \r\n\r\n64 player spawn \r\nMoving water that affects physics and players\r\n3d skybox\r\nSoundscapes\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstall by extracting the bsp file to your counter-strike source/cstrike/maps\r\n"
