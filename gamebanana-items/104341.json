Somehow, it ended up becoming a server favorite anyway.  Apparently, what it lacks in flash it makes up for in gameplay.  I'm not looking for scores or critique here--I make *actual* maps nowadays--I just wanted to share.  Besides, it seems the majority of players prefer \"lesser\" maps like this one... :(\r\n\r\nI wish I could say for sure how many spawns there are, but I don't know...I'd guess 32."
