It's an almost fully created from scratch and totally hand-tuned .nav-file ('cause in original map author's release was included a simple auto-gen).\r\n\r\nMost areas were remake manually because during an auto-generation processing some of them were constructed incorrectly or incomplete (especially it concerns street part of the map). Some missed pathways were create from scratch, the specifically following: pass through windows from the street to a billiard hall, lifting on a spiral staircase to the room of the projectionist and transition through ventilation to a toiletroom.\r\n\r\nNow, after manually reworking of nearly 70% of an auto-generated Navigation Mesh, bots have opportunity to use ALMOST ALL walkable ways, with one insignificant exception: they don't climb on a building roof opposite to movie theater! I cleaned this paths from a final version of the Navigation Mesh for the following reason - bots very much dexterously got up, but couldn't go down dexterously also back that result to high percent of casual mortality and greased good impression of a gameplay. Also from the tactical point of view there is no special logic to get so highly on this map... I think that the majority of players will agree with me in this question ;-) For the rest bots play surely and freely!\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/152672).\r\n\r\nWell... Play and Test! Also don't forget to write responses and remarks in essence ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Michael Smart (for high detailed and fine realistic urban-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for its learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nWait the next blockbuster! :D"
