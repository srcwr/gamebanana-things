In pistol-map you can also choose the pistol you want to use. CTs and Ts have slightly different pistols.\r\nThere are 6 fy maps altogether:\r\n Knife\r\n Pistols\r\n Shotgun\r\n AWP\r\n M249 (PARA)\r\n HE-Grenade\r\n\r\nThanks to DeleHai for a great map, to Generalvivi for sign-textures and to iwannamap.com for great help with mapping.\r\nSome custom textures and overview are packed into the map-file.\r\nWaterfall-texture taken from cs_militia.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you are choosing the map, you have 10 seconds time after the spawn doors open.\r\nIf somebody purposely doesn't choose the map or blocks your way to the map-choosing-area, the spawn doors will open automatically in 10 seconds.\r\nAfter the map has been chosen, you have 20 seconds time to go to the teleport before dying.\r\nIf somehow 2 maps are chosen at the same time, the doors will close and you must choose again."
