Just so you know, the first lvl i made for fun. Just download and install to your server. \r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThe is like any other obstacle, 1 team (terrorist) trying to get past some jumpin levels (10), there are also some luck lvls. When a player gets to the final room, he/she will press a button that will kill everyone on the map, the winner will die slower. \r\n\r\nSuggestins:\r\nPut roundlimit on this map to something like 8 - 12 minutes, takes some time to clear all 10 stages."
