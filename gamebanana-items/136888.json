	"_sText": "Well this is my second finished map. I think this one is much nicer. If You like ch_boxwall and you like deagle then you should enjoy this map. It mixes the famous texture used in many gungame maps and some realistic feature. This seems to be a well balanced combination of these two maps and will spice up the variety of maps on your server.
