	"_sText": "zm_pripyat is the first CS:S map based on the abandoned city of Pripyat, Ukraine, which was completely evacuated after the Chernobyl NPP accident in 1986.\r\nThis map took around 2 months to make.\r\nUsing real footage and artwork, I modelled this map to resemble the most to the actual city.\r\nThe main purpose of the map is to give the player a constant feeling of loneliness and of being in a long-forgotten place.\r\n\r\nWhile relatively small, it has some of the classic zm style spots.\r\n\r\nIt features:\r\n\r\n- Precise mapping of the abandoned city of Pripyat, using RL footage\r\n\r\n- Climbing/Barricade spots\r\n\r\n- Up to 64 players\r\n\r\n- Pretty optimized to fit low-end machines.\r\n\r\n- Radiation dangers, watch your steps!\r\n\r\nHave fun in the forgotten streets of Pripyat..."
