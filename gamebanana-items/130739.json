One day, one of the most toxic viruses on one of the zombie specimens, zombochloroflorine, got into the bodies of some scientists at the laboratory and infected them. Your colleagues and you have managed to gather at the emergency exit of the facility, and now have to flee to nearest train station and hitch a ride out of the area, or be converted into a mindless zombie.\r\n\r\n*Notes- First door needs a lot of teamwork to break as they have 2000 hp.\r\n\r\nMap By: FW -=LightningZLaser=-\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to: *-=Leb=-, FW -=ANBU=- (GoPinoY) and FW -=iSETHEN=- for ideas\r\n\r\nTexture Credits: karatekafer (Skybox)\r\nPrefab Credits: Creat_1 (Boat)\r\n\r\n==========www.FireWaLLCS.net/forums=========="
