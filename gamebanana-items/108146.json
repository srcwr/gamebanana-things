	"_sText": "This map is made for the NegX mapping contest. It is based  around aim_ag_texture2 and it has 60 spawn points (I believe). I have a radar and NAV file for it and also a custom skybox but due to problems I haven't incuded these on this DL right now. Though I will update the file when this is fixed.\r\n\r\nIts base around aim_ag_texture2. I used some of the same things from the original and added some of my own. I also switched around the layout, but you can see the resemblances to the original.\r\n\r\nTRON- skybox\r\nfr33k- radar\r\nzzdd- help getting it all together ^^\r\n\r\n\r\n-----EDIT-----\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure the skybox and NAV file should be included now. If it is or isn't please tell me! thanks ^^\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT!!!\r\n\r\nupdated one here http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/61762"
