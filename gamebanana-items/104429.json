	"_sText": "IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nHDR, sun's position corresponds with lighting, more hiding places for the Terrorists, more furniture inside the castle and multiple different textures.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COUNTER TERRORISTS\r\n\r\nAs Counter Terrorist your purpose is to either protect the bomb site located on top of the castle by killing all of the terrorists or to defuse the bomb once it has been placed.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TERRORISTS\r\n\r\nAs Terrorist your purpose is to either kill every Counter Terrorist on the enemy team or to place and protect the bomb on top of the castle. There are 3 different ways into the castle:\r\n         1. Deathride located in the head of the Trojan Horse.\r\n         2. Cross the toxic river on the sides by jumping over the spheres.  Then use the ladders to climb on top of the castle.\r\n         3. Simply enter the castle through the front door.\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nI'd like to thank High Voltage and Elise Cookie for testing the map and giving me inspiration. Secondly my thanks go to all of the YouTube users who uploaded some interesting tutorial videos about Hammer.\r\n\r\nThe following members deserve credit for the use of their work:\r\n\r\n1. 1NzT4nT - Sand brick texture\r\n2. kAR1SMA - Sand brick texture\r\n3. T3cH - Prefab bridge"
