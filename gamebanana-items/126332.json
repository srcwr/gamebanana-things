	"_sText": "This map have some things what made me release beta. Its pretty much tested (both 100 and 200tick) and nothing with that. But i need help with light block, cause brushes seems bugg area of it. Also 10th level tele would work better. That problem isnt bad but could be good to fix (i think it causes on spinning tele).\r\nAll other seems ok, but I want those buggs fixed.\r\n\r\nAbsolute inspirated and helped me a lot so credit for he on that.\r\nI got that glass texture from him so i dont know who made it. BIG thx for creator of glass texture, its so awesome=)\r\n\r\nAlso thx to all who were even one of beta test/ gave comment. (Basicly my friends. some of them teased me with \"gimme, gimme, gimme. I want see beta!!!\") =P\r\n\r\n\r\nIf u know about how fix that shadow bugg, please tell me so i can develope map rdy. Also comment of everything else too what needs fix/develope.\r\n\r\nPlease, no anything like \"more details\" cuz 99,7% of brushes used so i cant make map any bigger.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots are what they are. Had low settings during taking screenshots. But who cares about few pictures,they are still good enought ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nIF something wrong, let me know. Thx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENJOY =)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nTexture pack what contains that orange glass texture can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2605"
