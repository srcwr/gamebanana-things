In a small, VERY small, part of a snowy neighborhood, Terrorists have taken 2 citizens of the town hostage. Reports quickly send out, with the city streets soon turning empty. CT's hear about this and plan to stop the incoming Terrorists from causing more damage. Will they win? Or will the hostages end up dying regardless?"
