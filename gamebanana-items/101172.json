The map itself has tons of places to run around and hide in, and many people say they just enjoy running around looking at things! For information about bomb sites and such read the .txt that came with the map :)\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the only pictures I saved of my actual bedroom for comparison are:\r\nhttp://img178.imageshack.us/img178/2204/pic4dm8.jpg\r\nhttp://img147.imageshack.us/img147/601/pic5rv1.jpg\r\nI would have been mapping until the end of the century if I added in the actual mess but you get the idea ;)"
