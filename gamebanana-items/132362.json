As my last map was bugged cause of some bad luck hammer crashes i took some of the house and stuff and created a new map with an high performance layout with the same theme. Just see the the screenshots.\r\n\r\nHope you like it and runs fine. I run some test with up to 48 bots mit bot_mimic 1 at the same time. My machine is not highend so i thinks its very well.\r\n\r\nIt also got HDR and custom HDR Sky"
