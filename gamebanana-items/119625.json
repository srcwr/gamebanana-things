	"_sText": "battle_nickz_minecraft is simply a small map to battle on, Which contains a bunch of boosters for you to gain plenty of speed on. This map would be fun for people who like to bhop/surf because there is a lot of strafing and bhopping. There is no need to change your servers settings because it automatically changes it for you (airaccelerate, enablebunnyhopping, buytime, starting money and enableboost)\r\n\r\nThis map is pretty much based on my older map (battle_nickz) but changed the spawns, cleaned it up abit and re textured with Minecraft Textures."
