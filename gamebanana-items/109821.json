	"_sText": "The terrorists start at the top entrance that leads to the Granin Design Bureau, and have to work their way down the warehouse stairs. The CTs start on the docks and need to work their way inside the warehouse.\r\n\r\nAll battle points are within the warehouse: two entrances for the CTs, one defence-able position for the T's.\r\n\r\nI created this map in homage to Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and it's gloriousness! \r\n\r\nHas a 3d skybox and is made to look as realistic as possible. Please rate if you enjoy, and check out metalgearsource.net for my current Metal Gear project!\r\n\r\nThis is a beta, but only because it has not been live server tested. It features fully custom optimized visleafs, a few secrets, and a customized bot file for offline play!\r\n\r\nThe teams are 10 versus 10.\r\n\r\nIt has been pakrat-ed, so their should be no missing textures or models! Please advise if otherwise."
