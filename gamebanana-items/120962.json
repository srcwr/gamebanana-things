	"_sText": "The concept could not be simpler: the map is a large rectangle divided into two parts along its length by a transparent glass wall, and adopt a style desert (de_dust textures). In each of these parties, there is a base, which lies on a bucket, then the opposite, at the bottom of the map, a cage similar to a cage of football. The terrorists appear on one side, nearly a bucket, while the anti-terrorist appears on the other, next to another bucket. Both teams can not shoot because a glass wall separates them. 10 seconds after respawn, the glass surrounding the bucket down on the wooden base is broken, and each team must bring the bucket in cages at the bottom of the map, as soon as possible. The first team to successfully place the bucket in cages blew the other team, and a new round begins."
