The map is exactly the same except that I made the ambient sounds less loud (that dog got annoying I was told), and I did some minor brushwork optimizations.\r\n\r\nCreds goto: .:.becool.:., mohax, runningma, and myself.\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading!!!\r\n<|TTF|> Jackorito\r\nReleased for Futura Studios\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/931"
