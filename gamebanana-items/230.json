Ive made it a cs_ map. \r\nThings to sort:\r\nTextures\r\nWindmill\r\nInside and Outside detail of houses.\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThis map has good pontential and can look really good. Reason im not making it is because i started it when i had lots of time, now im busy and cant do it. If you edit/make this map and release it, please send me a link to the page. I cant remember the number of spawn points, but i think it was around 24.\r\n\r\nThanks."
