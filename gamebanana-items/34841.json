As always, made all ways, named all places and improved passableness in some places. \r\n\r\nThe main difference between my NAV and [NAV by Meurglis3](http://css.gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3258 \"\") that my NAV have a place names. In terms of gameplay, they are not much different: in Meurglis' NAV terrorists slightly faster run out from their spawn, and in my counter-terrorists more rarely bypass the alley by the dumpsters side... In general, compare themselves... and have fun!"
