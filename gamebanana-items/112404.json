I really do believe this is a good first timer, just my thoughts though.\r\n\r\nI worked with the lighting a little bit, used cubemaps, threw in some props, fishes. I learned quite a bit from just making this map, and with the tips gattsu had givin me.\r\n\r\nI just ask, that you guys give your honest opinion on the map. Thank you."
