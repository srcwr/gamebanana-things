	"_sText": "This is my first released map and my seconds zombie escape map ever! It took me about 2 months to make with the help of the StoneCold clan. You start of at a yard kinda place and you can choose 3 roads; 1: To the right up a staircase. 2: Trough a door in the house and up through the house. 3: To the left and through a wall. The 3 roads will lead you to an abandon warehouse. The 1st road will lead you to the top of the warehouse where you will then have to go to the right on a wall and down a ladder, down there will be waiting a van that will take you to the end bridge. Road 2 and 3 will lead you to the 1st floor of the warehouse and the bottom. You will then go on a train and ride to safety, but unluckily the train get's stuck and you will have to jump on a truck to go to the end bridge. At the end bridge 2 things can happend (chosen randomly every round) : Either the bridge will break and you will go to a dark harbor where you will defend 60 seconds until the boat sails you to safety, or the bridge will not break and you will go into the skyscraper and defend for 100 seconds until the window breaks, you jump out and a nuke goes of and kills all the zombies. There are 3 secrets in the map that you will have to find without help."
