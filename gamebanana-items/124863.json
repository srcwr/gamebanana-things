So if someone know tell me and I will key author him!\r\n\r\n-Map skill is all about control. More map should have this main idea.\r\n\r\n-Some texture are missing after the update about source sdk to hammer.\r\nIn the folder I have put the texture, just insert the texture folder in common/counter strike source/cstrike/download/materials\r\n\r\n-Map getting run on legit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW07cp_GJRg\r\n\r\n-Map getting run on auto: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K32s8gchw1o"
