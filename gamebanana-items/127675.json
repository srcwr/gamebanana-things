	"_sText": "A multi aim map consisting of Knife, Desert Eagle, AK47-M4A1 and AWP arenas.\r\n\r\nI suggest using it without deathmatch mode. Although I don't think there would be any problems with DM other then spawn killings.\r\n\r\nThe person who reaches the toilet first gets to choose which weapon level will be played. Without DM this will happen at every round start. With DM, level will be only chosen one time (unless everyone on a team dies at the same time.)\r\n\r\nI tried to make them look as unique as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks for the awesome skybox [t.I.P.](http://gamebanana.com/members/966996 \"t.I.P.\") \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it,\r\nSinsic\r\n\r\nP.S. I'll put the individual levels as maps, so people don't want to play other levels can just play that. I'll add links here.\r\n\r\nUpdateLog\r\n\r\nBeta3 - 13.05.2013\r\n\r\n1.
