	"_sText": "Hi there\r\n\r\nMe and a mate (snitchables) decided to create an aim map each, just as a little competition. \r\n\r\nThis is my map, its mainly based around de_train. I used the 3d skybox, light_enviroment and the skybox from de_train to give it a train feel.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Re-uploaded and changed the lighting so it is equal for both teams.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map. Thanks for looking :D\r\n\r\n"
