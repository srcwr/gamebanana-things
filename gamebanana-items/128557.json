(sorry for my bad english)\r\n\r\nIn this map, you have to run and when you are the first who arrived in the end you can choose a level (awp, glock vs rifles, knifes, burn all).\r\nWhen tou start, you hear a cartoon sound. It's so funny ! \r\nWhen you run, you have to jump and run. Look at the screenshots to have more informations.\r\n\r\nSo, \r\n\r\nENJOY !\r\n\r\nVisit www.niko-mapping-studio.tk\r\n\r\nMAP BY N!kO"
