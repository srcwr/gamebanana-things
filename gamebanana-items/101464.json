They may plant an explosive inside the vehicle.  \nB: the Warehouse that loads the barrels onto the train could be a target.  that would shut down the whole operation.  \nC: a Waste Storage Tower near the warehouse may also be a target.  By creating a massive spill, they could be making a statement about the dangers of these chemicals they believe to be toxic.  \nD: We also believe that there may be evidence of alien life on a truck at a nearby Terminal Hotel.  The government may be using this group to destroy this potential evidence.  Stop them at all costs, the world has a right to know if this is true."
