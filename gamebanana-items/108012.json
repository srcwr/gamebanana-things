It's a big update from my earlier aim_marketplace, with better lighting, textures and more area to explore. \r\nI've worked extremely hard on this map, so please have a look at it, I'm sure you guys would like it. It's a 24 player map so it's reasonably big. \r\nPlease enjoy the map, I've put heaps of effort into it... \r\nHave fun!\r\n -HYP3R"
