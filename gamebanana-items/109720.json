	"_sText": "The big room is the main room. Both the medium and small room branch off of it. The small room has a bunch of obstacles and is probably best for close range weapons. The medium room has a few angles where you can shoot all the way across and would make a decent sniping spot, but they can easily be taken out. The large room has a great encounter spot that would be okay for campers, but if another route is taken, the campers are wide open targets :). Overall i think my map is decent and you all should try it out. Give me feedback."
