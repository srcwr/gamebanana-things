	"_sText": "This is the first and final version of aim_opposition. There will be bugs, there will be newbie techniques. Provide constructive, helpful criticism and help me get better.\r\n\r\naim_opposition is my tribute to the WooMaps Server. During production of the Beta, the Map-File began to take amounts of time to compile that were impossible to wait through. However by that stage the map was practically done, so I've spent the entirety of today fixing it up and preparing it for a final release using Fast VVIS.\r\n\r\nThis map was made entirely by me, Nexolate. Special Thanks go out to Woo, who taught me the basics of Portalling, and for the incredible maps he makes. You may not copy, edit or redistribute this Map without my explicit permission.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nEDIT: 32 Player Version released, also fixes the ladder bug and keeping weapons."
