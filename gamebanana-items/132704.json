	"_sText": "Once i had the idea of an interactive map\r\nA map where you can dynamically create your props\r\nto barricade yourself from zombies.\r\n\r\nOr something to play with, like a fully working magnetic crane!\r\n\r\nThis map is an industrial like map,\r\nthere is storage rooms, there is a lab with machinery\r\nand stuff. There's restrooms down the cellar (where the lockers are)\r\nthere even is a cellar where you can barricade yourself off.\r\nJust look for brown switches. They look harmless but they spawn\r\nstuff like: sofa, vending machine, shelf, cabinets etc.\r\nthere is also classic barricade spots and barricade spots noobs cant break\r\nalso there are traps in the map.\r\nmost of them are in the vents to prevent lame vent camping."
