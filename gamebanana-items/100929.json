So be sure to keep that in mind. Certain things, like the art gallery bombsite for example, will NOT look right on DX level 8.1 or lower.\r\n\r\nIn this map, there are secrets, traps, absurdity and other assorted crazyness. So be on your guard!\r\n\r\nAs usual, special thanks go out to the joe.to community, and all who gave me very useful tips and criticism to help make this map better. You guys should have seen my original version. I mean, the FIRST, FIRST one before I deleted entire rooms and started over. Horrible.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
