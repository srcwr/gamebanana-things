Stage transition zones are <i>between</i> the green stripes for consistency (see picture 2)<br>Map ends on the bridge between the 2 green doors (see picture 7)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; More Stuff:<br>Surf_drifting is a sequel to my first map, surf_driftless. Map was originally intended to be linear; individual stages may not flow well.&nbsp;<br>In my opinion most of the surf is tier 3 with a few tricky parts but the stages are very long. Bonus is probably tier 2; teleport to bonus is located at stage 1 start.&nbsp;<br>If you aren't playing the map on CSGO and experience lag, try disabling HDR. Also, and this works for CSGO as well,&nbsp;<br>try r_3dsky 0.&nbsp;<br>Most of the wall lights are illusionary (you can go through them)<br>There are a lot of landmarks in the map. Playing with high ping will reduce gameplay quality<br><br>CSGO port:&nbsp;https://gamebanana.com/maps/198633<br><br>Thanks to Silverthing and Profile for the&nbsp;video:<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/06GOhAZCCnQ\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/06GOhAZCCnQ</a>"
