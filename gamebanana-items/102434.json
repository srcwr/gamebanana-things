There are two bombsites, one at ct spawn.  20 spawn points for each team.  This map trys to focus on tactics & gameplay rather than visuals (though the visuals arn't bad - just not realistic).  Most of the map favors close in weapons, though there are a few areas where snipers will have a definate advantage.  \r\n\r\nSize: 7102KB\r\nType: Demolition\r\nSpawns: 20 each for t's and ct's - 40 Total (Not recommended tho)\r\nAuthor: MaelstroMGooF\r\nFeedback: samgilligan@gmail.com\r\n"
