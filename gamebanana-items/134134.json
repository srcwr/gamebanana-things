Sorry about that ladies and gents.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is version 2 of my previous map \"bastille day.\" I've added a land bridge from the second floor of each spawn building, as well as roof access to this land bridge, with some cover on and inside the bridge, as well as crates to hide behind inside the buildings. Crates have been added behind the Arc for knife fight insanity."
