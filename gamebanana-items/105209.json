I will be releasing a final version within a month or so, I would appreciate feed back so I know what to start on for the final version.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<font color=\"yellow\">Description:</font> \r\n\r\nFor the Most part the layout is the same as the first map <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/56401\">Aim Texture Arena</a> but there are some changes. In general the map is smaller and has so new obsticales.\r\n\r\nAt each spawn there is an elevated platform that can be used for range. behind the spawn is a hall way that goes around the map and can be used to get around foes in the middle of the map. In the middle there is a completely different set up that works better, it set up with a plus shape pillar in the center with 4 walls anround it and crates on the right and left. If you like the first one you'll like this one.\r\n                        \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAs far as credits go I'm the only one who work on this map and I used source sdk.\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\">*Note:\r\nDo not copy, modify, or redistribute this map, without author consent*</font>"
