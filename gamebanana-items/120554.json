Therefore, post feedback.\r\n\r\n<div><b>CT's Purpose:</b>\r\n\r\nGo across the map, and into one of the Gazebos (lol). Then press the button, and the T's will blow up. \r\n\r\n<b>T's Purpose:</b>\r\n\r\nPrevent the CT's from getting across the map and buzzkill you.</div>\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of every round the players are stripped from all weapons, but the T's can pick up one of the awp's that spawn in front of them. The CT's only have grenades to help them, they are randomly placed around the map. If there's any other maps like this one, I've never seen them, and I'm not stealing your idea..\r\n\r\n<div><b> Have Fun! ~(O_o)~</b></div>"
