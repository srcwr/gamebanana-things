You cannot score without your flag being at the base. Scoring kills the other team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map:\r\nThere are three routes, the middle is the fastest, but prolly the hardest to stay on. The south is easier than the middle and includes some wall obstacles and is meant for the newer is-ers. The northern route is an upper route that is the slowest but will take you directly to the opposites team flag.\r\n\r\nThere are two shotties, one at each teams base. They are intended for defensive use tho you could go offense with them. However, I Would recomend sticking one teammate on D tho.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to www.solidsurf.info, www.fpsbanana.com, www.mapjunkies.com, and Icecreamlock for hosting the beta! \r\n\r\nAdditional thanks to Apexi for the ctf+is idea :D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nice skate @ 217.163.25.22:27015\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNote: This map is not intended for deathmatch servers. Ctf does not work in deathmatch, deathmatch destroys the weapons people have after they die instantly, which also destroys the flag logic. \r\n\r\nThis map is compiled with hdr, if you dont like hdr, turn it off with mat_hrd_enabled 0 in console! have fun :D\r\n\r\n"
