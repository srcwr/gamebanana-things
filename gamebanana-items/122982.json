One thing I did add was a bombsite on top of the house that holds all the weapons of the map, to ensure that rounds end in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOther then that, this is just a nice clean, new feel to skyscraper, and I hope you all enjoy it!\r\n\r\nQuestions/comments/bugs/complaints:\r\n\r\nXfire: wowyourgaiy\r\nEmail: phantomoper3@comcast.net"
