	"_sText": "This is an updated version of my old conversion of Tetsu's DokiDokiPanic! map made for Half-Life 2. I converted it from scratch again and this time added more barrels and a sniper button, it doesn't give you a sniper, because there isn't any weapons, you kill with traps, its just a trap where it shoots 2 places where a player might be. Those locations are: The laser cannon, and the explosion button that you can see in one of the screenshots. I added more sound effects and changed fire damage. Good luck, try to use each trap to kill the other team. You may want to look around and find out what the traps do and where they take effect before playing this with an opponnet. Have fun, the changes were minor, and I gave Tetsu credit so plz do not complain in the post section. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: Press USE [E key] to activate the traps!\r\n\r\n\r\nHint: In this version neither of the teams get a knife."
