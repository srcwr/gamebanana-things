	"_sText": "This is the \"Umbrella Corp.\" logo from the \"Resident Evil\" series. Due to it's enormous size, this would look good on a tall building or what ever you wish to do with it. Do what ever you want to it, however, if you do modify this prefab in anyway, be sure to include my name in the credits. I will allow this prefab to be in packages with other prefabs too. This is for everyone and i hope you all enjoy it. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nFollow the folders in the \"RAR\" file until you get to the folder you dont have, then put those remaining folders there (just like all the other \"RAR\" files you've downloaded.) The RAR file starts in the \"ACCOUNT NAME\" folder, also refer to the \"Readme\" notepad in the RAR file for further assistance. If you have any problems please say so in the \"comments\" section."
