So please\r\ntell me something about your ex-\r\nperiences and other. \r\nI also need two more persons:\r\n1 for making a good .nav file\r\nand\r\n1 for making an overview, because\r\nI don't know how to do it xD\r\nAnd those need to be pleased with\r\na note in the credits including \r\ntheir names and a short note.\r\nSo, if you are interested and if\r\nyou are able to talk to a german\r\nguy speaking english like a dummy,\r\nthen send me a PM and tell me\r\nsomething about you.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The map includes many \r\ntexture bugs at the moment, but I \r\nhad no time to correct them until \r\nnow, so please just rate the\r\ngameplay and not the look first.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nP.Panda\r\n"
