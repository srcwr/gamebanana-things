It looks like a factory in the desert with all the attachments. A crane (drops a car with a button), water towers, smoke tower, loads of tanks and a working helicopter with sound. There are underground tunnels and ladders for getting on high ground.**\r\n\r\n**About the sounds part: the looping sounds are the sound of the helicopter of course (not too loud, so it's not annoying) and also the main looping sound is the war & battle firing. Minor sounds included are some steam sounds, pipes, machines...**\r\n\r\n**The map has effects like: fire, smoke, steam, etc.**\r\n\r\n**That concludes the description :) Hope you comment, rate, and report for any bugs. (please don't flag, rather comment and I will fix it)** \r\n\r\n> **To install, simply put the cstrike folder in the download over your old one and overwrite.**\r\n\r\n**Hope you like the map and ENJOY! :D**"
