At the end of it are some experiments I would like to do with the map.&nbsp;Some of the challenges, or most of them, I tried to do differently or just get out of my head. Some are obviously inspired by other course maps already made.<br><br>• 21 Levels<br>• 1 Secret<br>• 1 Final<br>• Some smoke tracers on the map<br>"
