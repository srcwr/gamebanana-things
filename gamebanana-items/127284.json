Atleast, one that everyone knows about.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>I made this map for my community and have bug tested it and everyone loved it so much I thought I'd upload it.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>I was also disappointed that not many good deathrun maps are being made anymore for Garrys Mod. So I made something that my community and I really enjoy.&nbsp;</span><br><br><br><br><span>Basically I designed this map to originally be an underground sewage system. I noticed how deep the surf ramps I was designing were taking the player. So I decided lets start adding some lava and some cave structures and pretty soon I decided it wasnt an underground sewage system anymore.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>I have put a ton of time and effort into the map. I added some basic underground scenery areas to give the map a little sparkle, something I wish deathrun maps had more of.&nbsp;</span><br><br><br><br><br><br><span>BELOW ARE THE CONTENTS&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>- 10 traps&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>- 60 spawns&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>- 6 surf rooms&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>-3 minigames (Jumprope, Survival, Bunny Hop)&nbsp;</span><br><br><br><span>COMMUNITY SITE&nbsp;</span><br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ebolaidsgaming.com/forums/index.php\">EBOLAIDSGAMING.COM</a><span>&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>COMMUNITY DEATHRUN SERVER IP&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>165.255.215.33:27015</span><br><br><br><br><br><span>Other credits (Coulnd't have pulled of some of the map without content from these amazing people)</span><br><br><span>Survival from Deathrun_Atomic_warfare by MuhCow&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>JumpRope from Deathrun_Helix by HyperCUBE&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>lava texture by komaokc and Surf Gurus Productions&nbsp;</span></p>"
