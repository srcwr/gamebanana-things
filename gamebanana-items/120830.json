	"_sText": ":D This started as a joke of making a pig statue for a prefab, Uberkirsche gave me the idea but you don't want to know how. So it's just a big pig, buildings on either side of it and a lake infront / behind it. There's a slide going down from his snout and one from his ass. There's also a small ramp on his back that you can use as a launcher to launch you to the lake infront of him. So basically, its an all out knife fight where you can run in so many ways.\r\n\r\n*Note* Piggy crushed a gas tank and it's on fire. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/x9GA21mbTc0&rel=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/x9GA21mbTc0&rel=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*NOTE2* This is just a beta, I will be releasing another version with better water, fill in the empty space by the 2 lakes, add more cubemaps, possibly make it bigger and restyle it for an aim map and / or use w/e ideas you come up with for me. So please, PLEASE give me some feedback to work with."
