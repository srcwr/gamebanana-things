This map will not crash a deathmatch server however the CTF portion of gameplay will not work properly. This is caused by the DM mod destroying guns after people die. This also destroys the flag when people die, or try to score a point.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\nThe Kosher Pork for seting up the beta and to all the beta testers! Additional thanks to fpsbanana.com, www.solidsurf.info\r\n\r\nI created this map in the vision of fy_iceworld, I did not decompile the original map. Everything was made from scratch from my best memory.\r\n"
