The red spinning orbs are \"power-ups\" which increase your speed to 130% there are only two on the map.\r\n2. To prevent stupid stand-offs where nothing happens anywhere from 45-90 seconds into the map a large amount of grenades will fall from a glass box.\r\n3. To force end the map, very useful if you are using bots who get stuck, the deadly gasses from the swamp will begin to take their toll on the players. 120 seconds into the map the gasses will begin to have their effect, they get deadlier over time.\r\n------------------\r\nBots do not do very well on this map\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSpawns, 20T - 20CT\r\n\r\nMap created by Mute+Deethis!"
