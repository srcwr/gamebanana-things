I took the original .vmf and rebuilt it from scratch.  It is fully optimized and has a brand new feel to it.\r\n\r\nCredits:  Credits for original design and build go to Smurf™.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n-Noticeable texture scheme change\r\n-Aesthetic changes throughout the entire map IE: stairs instead of ramps at certain places/wall changes etc.\r\n-Optimized to the best of my ability, for smoother game-play\r\n-Other changes\r\n\r\nAll in all, I hope this remake will be worth while for all the fanatics out there.  New feel, runs smoother, and still just as fun to play!\r\n\r\nComments and ratings are always appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n-:Gaiy-P§ycho:"
