	"_sText": "Heres a great map for all you HE-map FANS out there.  Heres the scoop.\r\n\r\nThe T's start on one side of the top level (behind breakable, but tough boxes) and the CT's start on the other side.  It begins by lobbing grenades found at your spawn to the other side of the level,  but turns into much more than that.  In the middle of the level is a line of m4s that you can get if you can dodge the grenades.  You cannot get to the other teams side unless you go through the underground tunnel, which has shotguns.  This battling goes from fun to an extraordinary barking wild good time as you can turn out the lights and dim them making it dark for a few seconds and then you can turn them back on again. on each side of the level are two red buttons which when shot trigger the lights. Its a VERY FUN and EXCITING map.   Props to the = HcO = clan for another great addition to their map cycle.    \r\n\r\nIf you wanna play this and other many exciting custom maps,  got to \"= HcO =  Hot Cups of Ownage\" server and have fun.  \r\n\r\nDOWNLAOD IT !!   YOULL LIKE IT!!!"
