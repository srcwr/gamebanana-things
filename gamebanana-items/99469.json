I used hostages for the briefcase, the hostages spawn on the second floor near the main entrance, and across the building on the first floor near the generator room.  The extraction zones are the same as in AA, both parking lots(CT spawns) and on the roof at the helicopter.\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nGIJOE92"
