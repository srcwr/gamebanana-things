	"_sText": "Aim_bunker_v1 is my very first map created with the hammer editor.\r\nIt's a very dark underground map which reqiures the cvar mp_flashlight set to 1 if you want to be able to see anything.\r\nTwo spawning areas, CT and T, each with 26 spawnpoints. Buyzones covering the whole spawning areas. 3 exits from each spawning area leading to a middle room.\r\nAny tips and ideas for future versions would be greatly appreciated. Other general mapping tips aswell. Thanks."
