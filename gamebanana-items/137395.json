	"_sText": "This is part of a one hour map challenge our group had. Inspired by the rainstorm outside, I created a wet gun game map that has a nice fluid movement between areas. The water intensifies the reflectivity of the textures giving everything in gg_wetworks a smooth almost vinyl look.\r\n\r\nI know there are probably things that can be improved, which may be done in a future version, but just keep in mind this was a 1 hour timed challenge to make a map from scratch from a single author. The folks in my studio participated in doing QA etc. on the final map. I posted it here for all of you to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI have included both a map thumbnail and a NAV file for bots for your use as well. Have fun."
