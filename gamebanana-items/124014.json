There are 2 rescuezones available.\r\n\r\nCreated by ICS 27th of October 2008\r\nE-mail: ics@ics-base.net\r\nWWW: http://www.ics-base.net\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is VIP version (assassination) of my previous map de_hiekka. It has been improved since and 90% of the textures have been changed, more routes added to support assasination mode better and some minor fixes. The defuse verion can be found from <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/67808\">here</a>\r\n\r\nI decited to make vip-mod version of the map since there arent any good big ones available - or not even smaller ones. I looked the assasination section and it is quite empty. The reason why i made it so different looking is that players can easily spot which version they play. \r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nPS: Hiekka is a finnish word and translates as sand in english."
