	"_sText": "This map is extremely dark and dramatic for a game like counter-strike, but that's why it's fun. It's got a lot of stairways, narrow hallways, and rooms that make you want to keep turning around to make sure that nobody is behind you. It also looks really cool when you have your flashlight off and the only things that light the room are the bullets you fire at the enemy. "
