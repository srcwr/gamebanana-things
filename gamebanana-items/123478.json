	"_sText": "I am extremely proud of this map.  Partly because it looks so nice but also because I managed to make it run smoothly with 24 players WITHOUT using nodraw.  Of course, for this version that I've uploaded to FPSBanana, I've optimized the whole thing.  Not 100% satisfied with the bombsite explosion, but people say that it's good enough.  I plan to also convert this one to a normal land map.  When I do, I'll take out the bottom floor and remake the top to be as detailed and realistic as possible.  But that's pretty far in the future.  For now, enjoy this.\r\n\r\n"
