It's a VERY good map and will make you play CS Source longer than ever!\r\n\r\nMap contains about this:\r\n\r\nExploding car\r\n\r\nAn extremely  fun to play with torpedo\r\n\r\nLock down for T\r\n\r\nOver 4 secrets\r\n\r\nCustom model\r\n\r\nCustom textures\r\n\r\nCustom sound\r\n\r\nAll in the .bsp!\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not say its flat and ugly before playing it. I've heard enough of the dorks saying \"ugly. flat. no I will not test it.\" This map is impossible to take screenshots of and show the extreme fun in it. And if you don't believe me I got a whole army of CSS nerds that loves this map.\r\n\r\nDisplacements -> Yes I had it once. Totally killed the fun. Removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n/Freelancer"
