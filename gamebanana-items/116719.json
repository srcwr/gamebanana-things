	"_sText": "This is \"sequel\" to trap_catacombs. It's a tighter and smaller version of a traps map which includes even more interesting traps and play on triggers.\r\n\r\nThe classic \"floortrap\" traps are still in, and there are some special ones, such as the water trap, a slowly water filled room, the panic button, the yellow corridor, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis is a definitely good map to add to any fun/custom maps server."
