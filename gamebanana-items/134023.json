Other than that you can be killed if you hide behind a wall and enough bullets are fired.\r\n\r\nGun damage is greatly reduced passing through windows or walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGG_BulletProof_ADV Coming SOON!  STAY TUNED!\r\n\r\n\r\nOwner took of the SFD off his name he he..   I play in ISP, CMG, DCM, DAO, and CW Servers all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwist from ISP is a nub for not believing me.  \r\n\r\nI will tag my fuckin map and you all can suck it!  I will update it though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
