			"_sText": "<p>- fixed issue with 2 accidentally deleted models in css4, which may or may not have been prone to crashes</p><p>- fixed issue with the falldown-checkpoint potentially teleporting you inside of ladder tiles, making you stuck</p><p>- fixed issue with the falldown-checkpoint potentially teleporting you inside of lowgrav tiles, only to fall down again</p><p>- fixed issue where the wind crystal could push invincible zombies (no context-filters in CSS caused this, worked around with a vscript-based push)</p><p>- the map no longer sets ignitelifetime -1 on round-start, which seems to have ignited spectating players</p><p>- increased the pizzadoom event hp a bit (from 1000 to 1200)</p><p>- added two damage-multiplier variables for optional server balancing (::HURTPLAYER_mult_ct and ::HURTPLAYER_mult_t)</p><p>- the human who shoots down the kamikaze plane will now get proper kill credit from the pilot</p><p>- player kills will now give +1 persisting score, so each stage-win is now defined in the 100's, and the rest is your kill-count</p><p>- the item-button filter added in css4 will now block E-presses until the doors start opening, to avoid confusion</p><p>- reverted the auto-slay on the finale elevator for the time being, locked behind the variable: 'finale_elevator_autoslay_enable = false'</p><p>- added logic to deny general round wins if it was from a solo, no solorats allowed, go for the team win</p><p>- the bloodlust event will now reset the human-delay timer, to prevent z-invincibility from enabling by forced overdefending</p><p>- the ascend ending will now flash with less alpha/intensity to make it easier on the eyes</p><p>- the infinite finale run colorcorrection should no longer stay stuck now</p><p>- you will no longer receive falldamage if landing just next to an airslide-tile</p>",
