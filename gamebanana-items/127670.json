	"_sText": "This map has 20 t spawns and 20 ct spawns, it's under the minigames section because it's better used as a MG map not an aim map because of the trigger_Pushes on the ramps give you a boost to bunnyhop off, I use this map on my MG server and people seem to like it. So i decided to post it up here.\r\n\r\nThe map as two ramps that allow you to gain speeds so you can bunnyhop or if you are good get the awp at the top of the skybox.\r\n\r\nThere is an awp on the bottom of the pool and in the fire, but the fire does 100 damage so you have to be lucky to get that one ;)\r\n\r\nTheir is also a CT buyzone and a T buyzone.\r\n\r\nThats all their really is to the map it's a simple creation, but fun to play on."
