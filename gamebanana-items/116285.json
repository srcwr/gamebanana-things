Don't download it if you don't know what you are doing. This map is a \"Transporter Maze\" map. You need to find your way to the finish by remembering what portals to go though. If you choose the wrong portal you go back to the start. You open the portal by opening the door and it slides down. It's a pretty short maze. Are you up to the challenge?"
