	"_sText": "A fairly small map for 2-18 players (9 spawnpoints for each team, although 18 players could get messy). Each player starts with deagle, knife, kevlar and helmet. There are conveyor belts that can take the players from their own spawn to the other teams spawn in seconds, which make the map pretty fun. I have tested it on my clans server earlier, and I got lots of positive feedback.\r\n\r\nFeel free to develop futher on this map, but please let me know about the changes ;)"
