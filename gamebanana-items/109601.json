I recreated this map for Source from the 1.6 version that Boomstick made.\r\n\r\nThis is not perfect so please post any improvments, helpful criticism (no matter how harsh), or suggest ideas.  I am looking forward to upgrading this map as soon as I hear any constructive feedback from you guys.\r\n\r\n<B><U>Note:</U></B> My graphics card isn't that great so the graphics and the props will look better in-game.\r\n\r\nHave fun playing it!\r\n\r\n<B>EDIT:</b> I added the skybox textures to the archive, I forgot to add it the first time sorry."
