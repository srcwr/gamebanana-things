	"_sText": "<i>From imagination to art.</i><br><br>A year ago, I wanted to create the best map i can, so I started making bhop_shutdown. As you may know, it had a lot of problems and overall was not a great map, however I tried my best and personally think that it was quite successful. Now I tried my best again and made maybe not the best, but surely a great map that i can be proud of. Shutdown2 is a sequel to the first shutdown - same concept of flybhop/surf combined map with intentional skips and simple strafe elements that is fun and more or less easy on both auto and scroll, yet very hard to run.<br><br>This map tells you a story about how an idea is born in a creator's mind and what the creator has to face throughout developing his idea. As a contradiction to the first shutdown, it is set in a world that is being developed from scratch. <br><br>Gameplay-wise, I have tried to improve wherever i could to make the map more fun to run and play casually. It has a lot of surfs and spins so I should probably say sorry to people with low sens, haha.<br><br>I used a lot of assets in this map - comment for credit if i forgot you.<br><br>Music: <br><br><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sodxwxter/bhop_shutdown2\">https://soundcloud.com/sodxwxter/bhop_shutdown2</a><br><b>??????</b><br>https://soundcloud.com/uplotnenie/twilight-5<br><br><i>Mapping is just a waste of time, quite interesting tho.</i><br>"
