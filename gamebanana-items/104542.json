Birds are singing and everything is fine until Counter-Terrorist forces learn about a Terrorists plan to infiltrate into the warehouse area and bomb nearby buildings unless their demands are met. CT-unit has been dispatched to secure 2 key areas to stop them. Meanwhile, Terrorists are planning the attack...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the map that i have been working on for long time. I havent counted hours but for the last 4 months i have been working with this when i have had time and here it is. The final version. Compared to the beta release, I fixed lightning and this one has way better fps among other fixes (a ton). Textures to their rightfull places, small scenery issues and especially few odd walls. I had some help harnessing out the bugs and finding errors. Thanks for all who contributed and i am happy with the final result. \r\n\r\n\r\nTotal filesize is 16,3MB\r\nTotal filesize as Bzip2 packed: 5,45MB\r\nNavigation file (.nav) is 0,5MB (bzip2 packed less than 200KB)\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated by ICS on 3rd of August 2008\r\nE-mail: ics@ics-base.net\r\nWWW: http://www.ics-base.net\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Play the map, don't just look at the screenshots.
