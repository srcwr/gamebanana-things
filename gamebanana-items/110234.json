Doing so will cause the ban of your account.\r\n\r\nI know there is no displacements but it is my first CS:S map and it's a large step in mapping from my other maps. This map is mostly filled with wacky and weird things. Explore, take your time. Just don't get sucked in the map's aurora of fads.\r\n\r\nIt features:\r\n\r\n- Bump Maps\r\n- 1 Cube Map (hold on I'm not a detail extremist :P)\r\n- 3 background songs. Each one has a 33% chance of playing on 1 round\r\n- A dusk-like time zone for a war feeling\r\n- An anti-terrorist and anti-counter-terrorist shotgun of light in the middle, which activates in about 45 seconds\r\n- AWESOME CUSTOM TEXTURES from TopHATTwaffle and me\r\n- Funny deaths and sounds\r\n- A nice machine gun sound in the background for a feeling of distance\r\n- and MORE!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n- The teleport effect of when you touch the Justin Bieber picture might glitch you in midair. Sorry, I haven't found a fix for it.\r\n- There may be more, but I can't find anything else.\r\n\r\nP.M for help and bug reports."
