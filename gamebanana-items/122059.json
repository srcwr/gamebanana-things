	"_sText": "A quick guide on how to do the map: Don't get confused, focus on one route, and just follow it. \r\n\r\nThis map is slightly complicated to get into, due to the number of different routes that are possible, but once you get a good overview, you can try combining them in different ways. I have a few ideas what the exact fastest route will be, but I'm not quite sure between two of them.      \r\nRegardless, this is the product of a long and tedious mapping experience, running alongside the relatively newly released bhop awful2. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the map.     \r\n~Aux\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** Added KSF triggers and filters."
