	"_sText": "Well, I decided that the first version of this map was successful and fun enough to be worth making a more serious effort at a better version. The size of the inside of the map is actually the size I had had the original version in my mind. I added quite a lot more things too though, including roof access for terrorists and an entirely remade from scratch layout. It does bear resembelence to the original map though.\r\n\r\nThis version of the map works nearly as well with bots as the original version, but they are once again quite suicidal. I did fix the CTs going round in circles jumping off one of the platforms though. It also supports many more bots/players due to the increase in size and complexity of the map. It can probably even handle more players than the recommended amount(24).\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy feature of the map is HDR. I decided to add this because I noticed that the map was a small file size so it would be feasible for people to download it off servers even with HDR.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: version 2.5 adds some ladders to the outside to keep the action more focused at the bottom of the tower, as well as adding another walkway inside the tower."
