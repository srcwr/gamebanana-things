	"_sText": "Sunny Escape is a Prison made from Mars. \r\nUnlike many maps you can escape from Prison using the main gate.\r\nOnce outside you can go to the powerplant to turn off the power, Go to gun shop or go to a food shop. \r\n\r\nMap was made for the VersonoGaming.com servers, But anyone can use it. Full credit goes to the original mars authors. This is also my first release.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs.\r\nMap also contains a few secrets.\r\n\r\nAlso would like to say that this map was inspired by summer prison, Made by tom green. \r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nQuick fix, Changed a secret room and fixed some letters.\r\n\r\nUpdated\r\nNow has a bus that moves thanks to SimP-PgM and darkvininjavin. Also has a hidden room with music. Also removed the annoying walking in power room and added a wall that breaks in a cell. The cell that has it joins a cell with gun from a cell that doesnt. Also made few changes from last version.\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback if you use it."
