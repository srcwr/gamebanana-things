	"_sText": "For a little while, this map stayed exclusive to the Plaguefest server while i was figuring everything out. Anyone who leaked the map didn't have a working version for their server, since it didn't apply the surf settings how it regularly should have. I did a lot of balancing over time on this, and got this to a working, public state. This is by far not the best surf map, in fact, it doesn't have a whole lot of surf at all. It's basically just do a quick surf to the location you want to go and hold it.\r\n\r\nThis surf n cade style map was presented as an idea on the Plaguefest forums, but nobody had taken up the idea. Eventually after being bugged enough, i gave in and created this. Mind you, i had never really ever played surf, so i was terrible at it and didn't really know all the mechanics to surfing. For what it is, it's definitely worth giving it a try. It even has a Cade Only location for players who aren't good at surfing or can't at all.\r\n\r\nThere is only 1 secret, and it is just music. 4 different songs, 1 troll song that you need noclip to access. Songs are:\r\n\r\nWolfgang Gartner - Redline\r\n\r\nZedd - Push Play\r\n\r\nNoisecontrollers - Unite\r\n\r\nMen Without Hats - Safety Dance"
