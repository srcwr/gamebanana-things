	"_sText": "**Surf_Aether**\r\n==================\r\n\r\n the map is a single stage linear surf map set in a floating compound like structure with copious amounts of metal walls with glass in-lays. This o-so-conveniently  allows the light in rather nicely and allows it to reflect heavily off the various smooth glass ramps. Obviously this isn't shooting for realism, more for the aesthetics.\r\n\r\n_Contains 11 secrets!_\r\n\r\n**There are NO SPIRALS**\r\n\r\nThere are very few obstacles at all in fact, its meant to be a pretty fast surf map with good aesthetics.** Overall surfing time is about one minute with no fails.** Although that may be a bit short for you pros out there, this was designed for the noobs to enjoy the scenery, the amateurs to enjoy the challenge, and for the pros to master.\r\n\r\n  -Quick Disclaimer-\r\n-------------------------\r\nThis is my first surf map I've actually decided to release, so don't be too harsh with the criticism, but I am always open to feedback."
