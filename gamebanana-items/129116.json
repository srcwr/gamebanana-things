When you want that the prisoners can escape more easy, look for the old Version.\r\n\r\nThis is a Jailmap in a city. The jail is in a city and when the Prisoners escape they get into it.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nJackmaster - for supporting me and the projekt\r\nMdz (maschendrahtzaun) - Server which runs this map\r\n\r\nPrefabs:\r\neNnerGy.. : Air hockey , Tablefootball, MG\r\ncharli : plane, police car\r\nevjand : Slotmachine\r\nRyan : Helicopter\r\n\r\nThank you all for your awesome Prefabs - Sorry that i cant credit you in the Map :("
