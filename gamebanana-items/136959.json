	"_sText": "--------------------------------\r\ngg_texturedminicity. I drew this up a couple days ago, its a medium sized map with multiple ways around the map. Much like textured city maps. Focus around a large center building shaped slightly as a T. With a few scattered buildings surrounding the outside. All the textures are dev, so there shouldn't be any texture issues.\r\n--------------------------------\r\nother: 32 slots, medium sized, no buy zone, NO full bright.\r\n--------------------------------\r\nPlease comment & assess. Thank you :)"
