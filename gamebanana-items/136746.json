Wich for me means colorful, contrast textures and more brushwork than models.\r\n\r\nSome people wanted me to use the \"glowing\" neon textures but for the reason that they have been totaly overused the past year I donÂ´t want use them. And its more \"like me\" to use other lighting effects.\r\n\r\nOne other goal I had was to make something harder when it comes to gameplay. I wanted to have less cover and more open areas so Players cant hide and camp too easy. A blank field aint that good either but I think I found a pretty good balance at last.</font></b>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"1\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" color=\"lightblue\">\r\n\r\n<b><font size=\"3\">Features</font></b>\r\n<ul><b><font size=\"2\"\r\n<li>Custom Meshes\r\n<li>Custom Textures\r\n<li>Custom Skybox  <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/1966\">\"Miramar\"</a> created by Hipsot and converted to CSS by \"[-B-]\"  <b>\r\n<li>Custom Navigation Mesh (nav.file) for bots including place names.\r\n<li>Advanced Optimization\r\n<li>Custom Radar/overview\r\n<li>Custom motd (Welcome screen)\r\n<li>32 spawnpoints (16 T/CT)\r\n<li>packed bsp.
