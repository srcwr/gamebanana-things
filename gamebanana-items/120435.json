So i started <u>without</u> knowing what i want to do. I just created a street, some grass and houses. I added Bomb Sites and Secret Places. The map went bigger and bigger. Until i decided to release it. I made a nav file and optimized it.\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\n<b>Thanks to</b>\r\n\r\nHamster (AOE Towncentre Prefab)\r\n#NeutraLized (Artillery Prefab)\r\nScarthman Nosoul (Barn Prefabs)\r\nWaponen (Bikestand Prefab)\r\nfallqvist (Old House Prefab)\r\nN4vros (Tree House Prefab)\r\nValve (Textures :P )"
