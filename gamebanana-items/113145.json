There is also a functional \"radar\" above the middle of the map, only precise enough to show if someone is in a color and what team they are on. There are several secrets throughout the map, just keep an eye out. \r\n\r\nUnRAR and drop the .bsp in your cstrike/maps folder. All sounds and textures are pak'd into the .bsp for your convenience. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nURLs to credit the condributions can be seen at team selection."
