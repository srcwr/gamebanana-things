I've learned a lot since my past release's and I've put my new skills to use in this piece.  Ambient sounds, 3dskybox, strategic layout, fog,  realistic displacements, and creativity all came into play.  It's a smaller map but with options, many different ways to play it.\r\n\r\nI made the lighting just dark enough that night vision can be useful, but just bright enough where you can see without it.  \r\n\r\nI've playtested it quite a bit and it is very enjoyable, I hope you give it a try.  Even worked well 1v1 even though it was a little big.  I like making FY's because they can be used for a regular CS:S and Gun Game.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the people who helped me test it and to interlopers.net forums for the great tutorials and troubleshooting assistance.\r\n"
