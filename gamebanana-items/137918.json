	"_sText": "Hello,<br><br>This is a map I started well over a year ago. I took a break from hammer for awhile, and I didn't have any plans to return to mapping at the time. But since my schedule started cooling down, I decided to come back to finish this.<br><br>This is a 2 staged map that combines surf and bhop. The original idea was inspired by sinsane2 b3. I wanted to make a much easier version of that, but design it to where you keep your speed between each section. It's pretty confusing, so I would recommend watching a replay of the map before trying it out.<br><br>The map contains 4 bonuses. Bonus 4 was made last minute, and there's no teleporter to get to it. In this bonus there's a single ramp, which you loop until you have enough speed to get to the end.<br><br>Due to the fact that you can prehop sections as much as you want, this map is a little hard to tier. But I'd say it's around tier 3.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoOVy1EuRKY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
