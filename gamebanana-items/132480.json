	"_sText": "This was intended to be a mixture of defend and escape gameplay like the Atix maps. At the moment it only area is the hospital roof but other areas from the campaign may be added later on.\r\n\r\nChangelog v2.2:\r\n-Added tank boss, will randomly occur (may not at all) each round and will select one zombie automatically\r\n-Made escape more difficult, more action oriented\r\n-Minor nerfs / buffs to hold positions to make them more fair\r\n-Added L4D music / sounds\r\n-Minor improvements to the 3D skybox\r\n-Players will have their ammo refilled every 40 seconds (for limited ammo servers)\r\n\r\nChangelog v2.3:\r\n-Made tank weaker\r\n-Made escape slightly easier\r\n-Added more hold spots\r\n-All hold spots changed to be better for Humans / Zombies\r\n-Fixed some players not getting ammo refilled\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBecause of the changes I have made you may find some major bugs or problems with the gameplay.\r\nPlease report any problems you see and I will try my best to fix them.\r\n\r\nSome of the music that plays can be controlled by the music slider in CS:S options.\r\n\r\nI will probably release another version later on with a better skybox and more hold points / areas if the map becomes popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n>>>>This map REQUIRES NoBlock<<<<\r\n---------------------------------"
