	"_sText": "<div class=\"SelectedElement\"><b>surf_crush2</b> is a Tier 6 Linear map with 1 Bonus.</div><br>surf_crush2 is the sequel to surf_crush, a map I released in 2015 back when I was trying out faster-paced surf. It's got more room for error than its predecessor, but maintains a high-speed and movement-based gameplay while being 3x the length. The map was mostly done years ago but was finished only recently.<br><br>The bonus is short and fairly easy, inspired by Spy_Complex's mapping style (but much more tame in the end result).<br><br>Thanks to many of my friends over the years for giving me the motivation to continue the project, especially Spy_Complex, Sam, and not_a_zombie. Thanks to hesuka for providing demos for the showcase video. And thanks to anyone who plays my map!! Enjoy! :]<br><br>"
