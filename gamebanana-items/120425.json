	"_sText": "I decided to upload this map to FPSbanana after the extreme popularity it recieved on the Geordie-Assassins public server. To play this map, you must set mp_freezetime 0 otherwise you will most likely die. The objective is to avoid the balls, then kill whoever survives. Shooting the glass out above will release more balls, some guns and even a special surprise.\r\n\r\nI hope this map brings everyone many days worth of fun on css, both for the serious gamer and casual player.\r\n\r\nOther commands for your own personal enjoyment include: phys_timescale X (Changes speed of balls), sv_gravity X changes the gravity.\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback and comments."
