It's a created from scratch and manually optimized .nav-file (because original .nav-file was not fully playable).<br><br>Most areas were created manually (also some paths were created from scratch) because some of them were constructed incorrectly or incomplete. Some pathways were precisely adjusted.<br><br>Well... bots use all walkable ways now and surely move through all extent of the map. And they absolutely do not suffocate from the musty smell of ancient Dust :D<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh was fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map author available to downloading with the <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/203188\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Yeah... your responses and remarks for me are still important ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: Squeezit (for nice twisted fast-paced map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Don't think about Dust :-)<br><br><i><span class=\"RedColor\">P.S. In addition to the NAV-file the archive also contains a minimap for the radar (which was not presented in the original release of the map).</span></i><br><br>"
