It uses standard CSS textures and meshes.\r\nThere is a new section which is blocked off by several blue\r\ndoors.  Someone must retrieve the \"Blue Key\" (outside) in order to open\r\nthe Blue Doors and gain access to this section.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the drums will explode and cause damage when shot.  There\r\nare drums that explode, poison the water, spew fire, and release toxic\r\ngases.\r\n\r\nAnd the health cubes really work, but note that they are removed even if a \r\nplayer with full health touches them.\r\n\r\n"
