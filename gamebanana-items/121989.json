The first team to hold the flag for a total of 2 mins, wins. A large scoreboard can be easily seen to keep track of the progress of your team.\r\n\r\nWeapons, buy zones and health restore points are located throughout the map to aid your cause.\r\n\r\nThanks to Spliff and the boys on his server for hosting and making the map even better with your suggestions and support.\r\nCome join us at 60.234.73.177:27015\r\n\r\nHave Fun.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nJackTheStripper for the Timer\r\nZalos for the flag prefab\r\nkaratek√§fer for the skybox\r\n\r\nThanks for the hard work fellas.\r\n"
