Then press your number.<i>screenshot 5</i>\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nI thought that this would be a good idea, so I made a map like this. If you want, I could try to make some kind of point counter or something, or like the person that shooted best, gets to kill all the other players..\r\n\r\nYou have 30 seconds to shoot on.\r\n\r\n<b>I can see that the screenshots can be misleading, but just give it a DL and try it out. </b>"
