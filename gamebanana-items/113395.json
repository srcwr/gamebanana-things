The terrorists start on one side and the CT's the other.\r\nThe middle openings are covered with breakable glass. Spiral stairways are included at the spawn points which lead up to the upper levels\r\nOn top of the walls there are a second set of stairways that are especially good for snipers if you can survive. There is a little secret\r\nto be found once you reach the very top."
