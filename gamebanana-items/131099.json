	"_sText": "Version 1.1 of Warped is out!\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- Random pathways! There are two paths that are picked randomly each round so this map will always keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\n- Teamwork! Some defense points require splitting up, but holding the choke point is crucial as well. Work together to overcome these obstacles.\r\n\r\n- Hidden secrets! Locate the hidden chainsaws that damage & push zombies, or the radio which can add some fun music to the map.\r\n\r\n### Final Note\r\n\r\n- I had a lot of fun making Warped, and plan on doing more ZE maps in the future.\r\n- Feel free to use this map on your servers, credit is already given in the map to me.\r\n\r\nV1_1\r\n==================\r\nMajor glitches (spike trap) removed from game.\r\nElevator now properly kills blocking players."
