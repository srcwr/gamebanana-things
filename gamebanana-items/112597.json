	"_sText": "This is my first upload to FPS Banana. This map is a symmetrical balanced map, inspired by fy_iceworld, but not in the same shape (obviously). There are 16 spawns, 8 on each side, 2 per room. In each room is a brush with a P90, M4A1, Scout, Galil , AK47, and Bullpup/Aug. In the breezeway connecting the buildings is an AWP, GS3G1 and SG550.\r\n\r\nThis map is only 95% done because I stopped working on it after my harddrive went *Poof* (I keep a backup of everything I work on uploaded to MegaUploads.com, and e-mail myself every .vmf file once per week). Now my Source SDK doesn't launch, so I can't put the finishing touches, little details here and there, and I wanted to put two nades in the middle with a buyzone on the bridge.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the brushes got clipped by water somehow, so the sewer ducts don't meet the grass in most parts. That was something else I wanted to fix.\r\n\r\nAnyways, have fun with this map. ~Ominn~"
