	"_sText": "I just wanted to make a scoutzknivez version also you now have access to the roofs and if you fall out of the map you will be teled to a location in the map. I removed the buy zones so that way its only scoutzknivez. If you want to use this for something different I have the vmf file their to edit it. Also you can just install deathmatch mod to it and that will allow more weapons. If you want me to make it so their is a buy zone i can recreate it and make it a non scoutzknivez map as well. Also check out the knk clan server out... 24/7 Surf Random Maps : 8.12.68.13:27015. We also have a scoutzknivez server up but it will be moving here shortly. 24/7 Scoutzknivez RPG : 216.6.229.162:27015"
