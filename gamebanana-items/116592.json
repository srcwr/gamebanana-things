One of the features of this map is it has several sections of glass, that when broken, cascade engines, barrels and all sorts of debris that chace you on your way down (hence the name avalanche). It may not look pretty, but it's a lot of fun. Also it might help you to know that anyhting in the yellow and black hazaard texture on this map hurts you."
