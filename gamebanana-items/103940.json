	"_sText": "<b>Die0's Notes:\r\n\r\nA medium to large de map of an old facility with 2 bombsites created by Die0. The map features a small outside area (T spawn) with a spectacular view and a large underground facility where most of the action takes place. The map's plan is very distinctive. With numerous hallways, rooms, intersections, and an accessible vent system it is pretty easy to get lost. However the planning of the map ensures that all the passages intersect often and that it is easy to find bombsites as well as to defend them. The zip includes a manually tuned nav file. With it bots never get stuck and make good opponents on this map.\r\n"
