This map was in dedication to the only server I have <b><u>EVER</u>&nbsp;</b>played on; Ibis.gaming. The map is akin to the popular map ze_random, but has incredibly smaller, and yet more challenging segments. I ran into a few problems while making the map<br><br>1: I had no idea how to custom textures (too lazy)<br><br>2: Water textures wouldn't load so some drops might seem a little weird<br><br>3: certain entities just didn't like loading<br><br>Have fun!<br><br>Screw you Srongfield<br><br>-Redacted-<br><br><br><br><br>Edit: Fixed the health on breakable objects"
