If you want this map for a server, I would suggest to Bzip it. The download will be much faster, when the file is Bzipped. When you put the .bsp.bz2 file on your server, remember the .bsp file too, else it won't work. The Bzipper can be downloaded here: http://css.gamebanana.com/tools/1495\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map, please rate and leave a comment.\r\n\r\nRead the README, then you'll find a some steps about how to get a plugin for your server, which allows you to get into the VIP room!"
