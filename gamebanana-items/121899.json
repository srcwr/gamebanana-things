On the first release, the system did not work, but it is fixed (info further down in this description)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMap by razEr\r\n\r\nCredit room by Billy : )\r\n\r\n- This map is old!!\r\n\r\n- 5 levels and one bonus.\r\n\r\n- If you end the bonus the end room will open a hole in the floor and a new button. This grants you 20 points.\r\n\r\n- This map has no jail, it has a point system, which grants you points depending on how far you get. (Level 3 - 3 points etc.)\r\n\r\n- If you finish the map you will be granted 10 points, and a button that ends the round.\r\n\r\n- The timer is set to 5 minutes, if that runs out, you will be granted points depending on your level, and slayed!\r\n\r\n- The bonus entrance is at the end of 3. (The bonus is made by Zoomj)\r\n\r\n- There are several secrets in this map, if you see a sprite( a glowing little thing), try walking into it, and see what happens.\r\n\r\n- A big thanx to zoomj for his wonderful bonus, and Sangre for the awesome texture scheme.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy playing this map, as it is now functional : ]\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy playing my map, and have fun ; )"
