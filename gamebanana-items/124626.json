That other 10% is water(From snow level.), skybox, Glass, and the Black and White textures hammer already has.\r\n\r\nI named the map cartoony because i pretty much drew everything in the map. This map is not easy at all. I made it for more advanced b-hoppers. It's only about 4 levels long. There's one secret in this map try to find it! :) \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n-distoRted"
