	"_sText": "This is modeled after the Tower of York, the entrance anyways. i am currently working on the rest of the castle although i doubt once i get that far if i will release it as a prefab, its a little big i think. this is a great prefab, the proportions are exact. i did add the Christ cross window for effect. adds some light and gives it a chapel feel. the stairs work excellent. you will need to add your own lighting, though  i had my light_environment at 600, ambient 160. this gave ample light to check out the map, the stairs were still dark and it was hard to see all the way into the rafters, after all that is a high ceiling. \r\n\r\nI will require that you mention me in your credits if you choose to use this prefab as it took me  over 4 hours to model it thus far.\r\n\r\nplease rate it and leave your comments.\r\n\r\nas always, enjoy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/wips/13426\">Link</a> to a visual of this prefab in map environment, and placed to scale."
