	"_sText": "Hey\r\n\r\nThis is a dev texture deathrun map with 15 traps. Players spawn with knives only and terrorists get a speed boost to help them keep up.\r\n\r\n****************\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n> HDR\r\n\r\n> No real easter eggs besides two flashbangs. It is a FAIR map.\r\n\r\n> No hidden traps. Even new players can see where traps will be.\r\n\r\n> Made with cool looking dev (developer) textures\r\n\r\n****************\r\n\r\nHope all of you out there enjoy the map. It's great fun to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE to Beta 4 25/7/10:\r\n\r\n> Last trap made harder\r\n> Can no longer walk on sills\r\n> Moved second flash\r\n> Increased CT spawns and reduced T spawns"
