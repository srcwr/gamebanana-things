I'd consider this map hard for _some_ people.\r\n- Some traps were inspired by other mappers, _all_ of which were credited accordingly.\r\n- This map is intended for _66 tick_ servers. (For those that still use 100+..)\r\n- Obviously, a **Noblock** plugin is required..\r\n-  Map allows respawn **_for the first ten minutes_**.\r\n  -  Map supports the [AutoRespawn](http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=905786 \"AutoRespawn\") plugin for that duration. (I _highly_ suggest you use it.)\r\n     - **For the servers that do not choose to use it, when you die, join spectate and then join the Terrorist team again.**\r\n  - I also suggest you use a dissolve plugin, one such as this: [Dissolve](http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=71084 \"Dissolve\").\r\n- **Thank you for downloading and playing!**\r\n- **If there are any problems, please let me know.**\r\n\r\n_fix Changes\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- The screenshots have not been updated as there were very little to no visual changes at the points at which I took the original screenshots. \r\n - Music is now controlled by the Music Volume slider in the Audio Options.\r\n - The map is overall _a tiny bit_ easier.\r\n     - The 7 second trap is now 8 seconds.\r\n     - Replaced the random doors with a different trap.\r\n     - The first two holes at the low gravity fall are a little bigger, and the last block before it is also bigger.\r\n - Changed the teleport method used at the longjumps. (To fix a flaw.)\r\n - Reduced the lag at the wind part.\r\n - Other small fixes and changes.."
