I wanted to keep the feel of this map as close to the original cs_siege as possible. I kept the same layout as in the original map but added to the inner complex almost doubling its size. Furthermore, I reworked the sewer system to be less linear and included two additional access points. The two original hostage rooms are the same but there is a third location where the hostages can spawn. The four hostages randomly spawn in two of the three rooms each round. Rather than doing a traditional overview of the map I opted to create a blueprint style drawing using AutoCAD. It really creates a nice effect and allows for easier navigation for players unfamiliar with the map. To further help navigation and to aid in the rescue of the hostages, the water in the sewer flows away from the base. Just follow it and you will get to the rescue point."
