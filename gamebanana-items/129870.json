Re-download to the current version of v1a1.\r\n\r\nI have had this jailbreak map for about 2 years now, I just haven't ever been able to release it.  Finally I am, and I m proud with how it came out.  It's supposed to look like you are on the edge of a cliff, facing an ocean.  Careful though, because the fall will kill you if you decide you can't handle the pressure of being locked up every day in a small cell.\r\n\r\nThis map includes:\r\n\r\n- Armory (With a prisoner warning system; The doors will lock shut for a little bit, and alert all the guards)\r\n- Standard cell block\r\n- Infirmary (Next to armory)\r\n- 4 Corners Game\r\n- Maze Game\r\n- Shot 4 Shot\r\n- Gun Toss\r\n- Pool\r\n- Disco\r\n- Race\r\n- Bunnyhop\r\n- Soccer field\r\n- Basketball court\r\n\r\nExplore the layout as a guard, because you can go on top of the cellblock roof (there are ladders, and crouch jump areas).  There is also a guard tower near the pool for snipers.  So have fun with this map, because there is a lot of exploring to do, even if it looks like a small map.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the security system in armory, you need to press the button downstairs in armory to activate it.  Once activated, any prisoner who walks into the red beam will activate the security system.  The doors will close for a small amount of time, and the guards will be alerted.  Prisoners in the locked armory have a small opportunity to arm themselves before the guards get their."
