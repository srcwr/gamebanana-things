And the job is done.\r\nThis is the final version.\r\nIt's a nice downtown with a bank, a gas station, a dance club, a movie theater, and a lot more.\r\n\r\nSecrets\r\n\r\n- Password protected door that leads you to the secret gun and a shortcut to the dance club.\r\n- A secret mini game with a secret end. Hit 200 in the TopHATTwaffle mini game to start the secret end.\r\n- Teleports\r\n\r\nSome good places to hide, climb and  make a good cade.\r\n\r\nSpawn Points: 64\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n\r\nd00d: For the fantastic props\r\nP3TR05.99 - For the logic keypad\r\nTopHATTwaffle - For the Daft Punk Prefab\r\njohbal - For the Shawnee Bank\r\naudiOtrash - For parts of the cinema front and the Rocking Music prefab\r\nJasenM - Trap\r\n\r\nA special thanks to the guys at ICC server, specialy Sandfly.
