	"_sText": "AIM_Basement is a small arena-style map. It has two levels, the top level and the bottom level or \"the Basement\". This map is scattered with destructable wall parts and is great for close quarter, Arena-Style combat. This map holds 24 players (8 on each side on the top level and 4 on each side in the \"Basement\"). Bots work well with this map except for one wall on the bottom level that they some times get hung up on, they can still shoot though.  Weapons are available via Buy Zone which are located at each of the 4 spawn points. All weapons are Defaultly available."
