Now religious extremesits have snuck into the base of the temple and plan to collapse it before any more artifacts are recovered.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Destroy the temple by crumbling the entrance, or destroying the centre of its supports.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: Save the temple and neutralize the terrorist force.\r\n\r\nMap by: PureKnickers (www.knixgeekout.blogspot.com)\r\n\r\nThanks to: Testers (a.k.a.
