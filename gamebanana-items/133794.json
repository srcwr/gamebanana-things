Them map consists of 20 spawn points, 10 for terrorsists and 10 for counter terrorists. Each team spawn location is located on opposites sides of the map. In the middle of the map is a maze of boxes, and on opposites sides of the map is a ramp (one on each side, total of two). There is a catwalk coming off the two ramps, through the middle of the map."
