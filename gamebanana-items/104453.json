	"_sText": "Without question, \"Tuscan\" is the most popular map that I've created to date. It is played all over the world in LAN tournaments and online leagues alike. Originally a 1.6 map, \"Tuscan\" evolved into a map that evokes a great sense of balance and a high level of teamwork to win the map. Unlike my previous source map creations I wanted to push the creative envelope with this one."
