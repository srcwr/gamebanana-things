	"_sText": "First I must say I have atrx's permission for editing this map. All credit goes to him for making this map. I just wanted to add the timer so people could possibly try speedruns in it.\r\n\r\nMap trikz_4teams_beta12 is really old map and its one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nMy original plan was to just add the timer. Then I decided to change couple of other things, nothing drastic. I know the map has a lot of extra space, but I wanted to keep it really close to the original because I liked the open feel of it.\r\n\r\nChanges from trikz_4teams_beta12:\r\n\r\n- added timer and implemented a good way for it to work on a trikz map\r\n- optimized with func_detail + nodraw\r\n- fit stuff more to grid\r\n- added env_light and lights\r\n- minor gameplay changes and bug fixes (faster flash spawn, flash delete, ladder works now and last levels teleport works)"
