But you happen to come across an ad to join the states National Guard in a newspaper, and it has good pay that can get your family a better home and a normal life again. You apply and 2 years after training, you go on the mission of a lifetime. STOPPING TERRORISTS!! But this mission might be your last.</h3>I hope you enjoy this well thought out andÂ <br><br>"
