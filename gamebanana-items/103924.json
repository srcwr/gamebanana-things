As negotiations spiral out of control, the counter terrorists are given the green light to go in and bring an end to the chaos through any means necessary.  The terrorists have identified two weak points in the structure, and hope to release disease and waste into the atmosphere through the bombings.\r\n\r\nGo go go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Starving Hobo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS:\r\n\r\nI'd like to pay a special thanks to Chizbone, who made the nav file!  If it wasn't for him, the nav would be a crappy automatically generated one, thanks : )"
