	"_sText": "The map features full optimization (I have many years experience with half life (1 and 2) mapping. I know how to work visleafs, func_details and hint brushes very well, so there is no questioning the FPS during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe map has a sewer who's water level can be raised by throwing a lever, the raising of the water disrupts other parts of the map (not all the map).\r\nNowhere on the map is perfectly safe, albeit a few cozy places for 1 person, but still killable.\r\n\r\nIt's a good map that offers dynamic gameplay and a lot of defensive strategies."
