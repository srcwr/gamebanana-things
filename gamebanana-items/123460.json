	"_sText": "This is the first map I ever completed.  No real theme or basis for its construction: just the results of my testing Hammer.  You'll notice some similarities to glass_crusher.  (Really only the bottom ledge and that's all.)  I was still learning how to use Hammer at first, so there were no models here.  I started out with them but I put too many and the map wouldn't load.  In the end, I just created it all from scratch.  Had no idea how to use the nodraw texture so, to prevent the glass from touching the metal and looking bad, each pane of glass is exactly 1 unit shy of touching the metal beams.\r\n\r\n"
