No...make that you WILL fall to your death. >:D\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know, this is how POWER (my map type because I can't make a mod) works.\r\n\r\nPOWER maps focus on two sides making it to one focal point that connects both sides, giving either team the advantage. The focus of POWER maps is to use the different classes as a team to \"take\" the focal point and have the advantage over the other team.\r\nThere are four \"classes\" in POWER maps:\r\n3 Technicians - They have machine guns and are decent overall. They are used for backing up other players and leading assaults.\r\n3 Snipers - They have sniper rifles and excel in range. They are used for taking out enemies from a distance.\r\n3 Guards - They have pump shotguns and excel in damage. They are used for guarding the focal point of the map and assisting in assaults.\r\n1 Special Ops - They have a silenced sub-machine gun and excel in stealth. Their uses are varied.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to fire_tyrone for inspiring me to do a second map! This one even has a sniper lookout!"
