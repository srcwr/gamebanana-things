I have included sniper posts btw for those AWPers and also a single bunker covering the 2 floors.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\nA US Navy SEAL was practising swimming in a top secret camp in the Nevada desert. However G-d was bored and decided to suddenly drop random objects from the sky! The SEAL tried to escape but in vain. He lies dead on the floor.\r\nLuckly only the one SEAL fellow was killed. But wait! Terrorists are going to try to laugh at the dead SEAL!\r\nCT team: The CT team must navigate their way around the place and kill those outrageous T's.\r\nT team: The T team must kill all CT's so you can laugh in peace."
