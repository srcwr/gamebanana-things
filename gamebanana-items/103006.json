This is my first official 'finished' release of a CS:S map so there is going to be a lot of room for improvement.\r\n\r\nZip file updated with filestructure including all materials, navigation, and BSP files.\r\nIf there are any questions/comments, please drop me a PM here: http://twhl.info/user.php?id=1741\r\nor send me an email @ brettpcg@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks, and enjoy!\r\n\r\n--\r\nDefusal map set in Italy\r\nMade for compo 32\r\nset for 32 players\r\n\r\nTerrorists are angry that the locals are buying foreign fruit and cheap wine.\r\nBlow up the market and wine cellar to show the locals that you don't mess around with imports and imposters.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists, help the locals drink and eat what they'd like. Give the terrorists a nice talking to with a .50 round to the helmet. Defuse those pesky bombs to keep your watermelons melony and your wine grapey."
