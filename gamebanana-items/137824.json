Because I've always believed in him as a mapper, I wanted to attempt to showcase how good he really is at making surf. This is my attempt to do so. The surf of the main map as well as 2 bonuses are by him, the name and the theme came from him. I just put things together, got some bonuses from some other people and detailed it all.<br><br>This one's for not only a great mapper, but also a good friend.<br><br>Map is a T5 linear with 6 bonuses total. Credits for everything can be found on your right.<br>B4 is not filtered on purpose.
