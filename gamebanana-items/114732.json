All of them have recently escaped from a federal \nprison.\n\nTERRORISTS:\n============\n\n- Defend the factory and kill all CTU agents.\n\nCOUNTER-TERRORISTS:\n====================\n\n- Kill all terrorists and recover all missing information about the political and environment issues that has been stolen.\n\nTip:\n======\n\nIf you want to \"camp\", this is not a map for this. The \"SKULL\" marks the point that you can't camp...UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES!!!\n(By the way, only once for round)\n\n\n- MunkyheaD -"
