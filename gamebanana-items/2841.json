The pack includes two diferent styles, flat ones and ones with steps. Of course the steps are more complex but I decided to include both in the same. I think they are kinda needed, as I don't see many on any maps, maybe because of its complexity? I don't know.\r\n\r\nBoth styles include bottom to top and top to bottom so you don't have to change anything besides the trigger push direction.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT ADVICE:**\r\n\r\n- If you plan on using many of the same ones, you should first \"Special-paste\" on Hammer and add a prefix to the copied one, so entities don't mess up with each other.\r\n- Also, remember to keep the \"tool/invisible\" covering the steps or else SOMETHING TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN.\r\n- I edited a default texture to make it scroll, If you want to change the texture its up to you to edit the VMF, currently the material file looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TextureScroll\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\r\n\t\"Texturescrollvar\" \"$Basetexturetransform\"\r\n\r\n\t\"Texturescrollrate\" \"1\" // Sets the speed\r\n\r\n\t\"Texturescrollangle\" \"90\" // Sets the angle\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n- If you rotate them, don't forget to set the push direction.\r\n\r\nIf you use them a simple thank will do.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
