	"_sText": "This map was created in about 1 day so it may not be the best blending map, but it shows potential and great practice. This was the first time I, myself, have ventured into lighting and it was good practice :).\r\nHope you enjoy this map, it contains 1 secret as of now; I'll leave that for you to find. ENJOY!\r\n\r\nCheck out a video of the map: http://www.xfire.com/video/3fe9d/\r\n\r\nAlthough the video is of v3b it's nearly all the same with another cool addition, plus light color changes, and fixed the center wall disallowing \"dodgeballs\" to go through. These are the changes made in v5 and hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading and playing!"
