My map has 2 missions (easy and hard) and ends with a ZM round.\r\n\r\n- Music and CC: Each mission has a variety of music and I make use of Color Correction to spice up the environment.\r\n\r\n- Models: I used a model from Dan's Pack as well as custom made Helicopter and APC to add some taste to the map.\r\n\r\n- Secret Items: Two different items (both of which can be used to ease the final stand in Mission 2) spawn at one of four different locations. One makes defending easier, one makes attacking easier.\r\n\r\n- Admin room/Level Selection: Located behind the APC in the spawn area you can control the levels.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n------------------\r\nIf anyone has the time, I would be very grateful to have as much feedback as I can get. Please feel free to critique the hell out of my map and leave the feedback in the comments below!\r\nThank-you and I hope you like Prototype!\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n------------------\r\n### B2\r\n- Fixed missing textures on helicopter\r\n- Fixed missing sounds\r\n### B3\r\n- Fixed balancing issues at end of Mission 1\r\n### B4\r\n- Reworked the teleporting system for AFK/losers who camp the beginning. It should be good to go.\r\n### B5\r\n- Mostly small changes to make the map enjoyable while I work on the official V1 release\r\n- Reworked the teleport system and fixed up the ending hold point in Mission 1"
