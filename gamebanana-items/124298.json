Under the middle are 2 weapon dispensers that have auto shotguns with 21 extra rounds. It can only be activated once per round. The opposite side of spawn has a ladder to reach the upper level. On the upper level are 2 more weapon dispensers they both have scouts. It can only be activated once per round and only have the default 10 rounds each. \r\n\r\nWhen I made this map. I only made it to do a time lapse of making a quick playable map. All I did was start and kept going to i was finished with the lower level. Then it took 5 month to finally finish it for source.\r\n\r\n<a target=blank href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ9nIafnnm8 \"><big>Watch Preview!</big></a>"
