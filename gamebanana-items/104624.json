	"_sText": "This is a large bombing map originally made for gun game but can be played with any mod, probably. This is my first map, so there are a few issues here and there. The map is very open with a lot of props. I didn't include prop lights and the walls and floors are far too thin. This allows you to see people on the second floor and through walls, as well as shadows. The fog adds an eerie effect, as well as the rain. I'm open to any comments good or bad, just keep in mind this is my first try."
