	"_sText": "Ok, this IS NOT A SERIOUS MAP.  The T and CT spwans are mixed together, and there are no buyzones.  I made this map so that my friends and I could start a server, talk, and listen to techno.  This map simulates a rave in an warehouse, like they often are.  Just screw around, hang out, and have fun.  There is a desk with computers on it, and if want (like i do) you can grab the para on the desk and blow those damn computers to Microsoft Hell-Where Bill Gates is more of a greedy, dumbshit Nazi then he is right now.  Also, there is a second level (as in many raves) that doesn't have a banister (like in many raves lol).  Up there is a shitload of paras if you feel like blowing the shit out of each other.  *Raving Tip* spin your mouse crazily, jump up and down, flash your flashlight on and off, and hey, why not get totally wated?\r\n\r\nauthor:  reflex| Mac Hack (author of de_atlantis_beta_1,2, and 3, as well as de_standoff)\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out for my next map coming soon: cs_espionage_beta_1\r\n\r\n-www.lamdasquad.com ----->the home of the reflex clan"
