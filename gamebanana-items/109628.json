WOOHOO!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nActually, unless something arises, such as a major error or bug, this is it....sniff.\r\n\r\nAh well. This map has ramps, ladders a giant building with multiple levels, and rooms!\r\nThe map also has a small sniper's tower, over near the CT spawn! The map now has railings on both building roofs, is in HDR, and has more boxes, for extra fun!\r\n\r\nThe map is done! Unless someone has a comment that I really love, and want to make a change, i'm done.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
