	"_sText": "Ok... this map was one that took me a little while and I had a little fun doing it. The concept is the Terrorists are the exterminators, and the CT's are the molez. This means the T's can stay in their nice warm spawn and try to get HS on the CTs when they come out of a hole, or they can go into the molez' home. There is a buyzone for each side, very wide open, and pretty fun when you have a ton of people. Nightvision is alnost a necessity. ALSO: IF TEXTURES ARE FLASHING ON THE ROCKS, JUST SHOOT THEM. THEY WILL STOP."
