The css version has far more content*</b></h2><br>This map was originally made for the Killzone mapping competition on gamebanana.&nbsp;<br><br>Sadly I just had four days to spend on it at the time, so the version released for csgo was quite poor. Bugs, little content and generally being boring were the main issues.<br><br>Hopefully I have adressed these issues with this css version. Added are three bonuses. One secret \"1v1-racing-minigame\", several eastereggs and many bugfixes and improvements.<br><br>Everything in this apart from the custom skybox was made by razersurf. Steamid: razersurf<br><br>Skybox (mpa104) was made by karatekaefer<br><br>"
