	"_sText": "<fieldset><legend><b>Update: 16-4-09</b></legend>\r\n- Removed the hatches at the race - they would bug when the button was pressed. Added an elevator instead.\r\n- Added fences to the shot 4 shot fields.</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><b>Update: 16-4-09</b></legend>\r\n- Spawn doors do not open when touched anymore.\r\n- The top of the ladders that you use to get up the wooden platforms at the spawn are now not solid anymore, so you will not get stuck behind them.</fieldset>\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a regular hosties map. It's an enclosed area. Terrorists have the option to take a secret way from the spawn. The ct's can control where they go etc. There's a Gun Toss, Race, Shot for Shot and knife/chicken fight arena. There are also \"random death cells\". Enjoy :)."
