May expand the map in the future, keeping to the original design, or completely changing a \"room\" if its unbalanced. There are 42 spawn points, each team has its own spawn side of course, map can hold up to 84 people due to being 42 per team max. This map is DeathMatch friendly! Map size is about 2Mb in size (176Kb compressed)."
