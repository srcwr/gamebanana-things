This map is mostly for the server I play on, but I decided to open it to the public because why not. I noticed some problems so I changed them.\r\n- I added actual lighting, it completely changes the map turns out\r\n- Removed the ability to camp roof by adding 3rd way on\r\n- Patched some elevator glitches\r\n- Re textured it\r\n- Added bomb sites since I got tired of people just camping the roof\r\n- Added the ability to break open the wall (only nades can open it!!!) at A site so it's a bit easier to retake\r\n- Spawn killing is no longer possible, I removed the outside CT spawns.\r\n-Bomb sites in pool and CT spawn"
