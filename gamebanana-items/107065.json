	"_sText": "Yet another remake of a classic. This is Double deck from Mario Kart 64. Even though this map commonly goes under appreciated, it is an excellent battle map from the original game. When I played through this, I figure the best way to describe it as a \"hunted map\" in which you are supposed to hunt down your opponents, more than just assault. Credit to Nintendo for the original design. This map features HDR, which is unnecessary, but it helps to beautify it.\r\n\r\nEDIT 7/27/07:\r\nPlease download this again, I have used pakrat to attach everything in a single bsp."
