It soon brewed into an abstract map.\r\n\r\nThis map is in absolutely in no way intended to be realistic. Its for fun, and it was mostly a learning experience for me. This was my first time ever making a map with custom decals or textures, or using many entities i have never used before. This being said, I will tell you all that there is a lot better work in store for the future.\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\n<b>Special thanks to:</b>\r\n\r\nCrazypip666, for answering all my questions and embedding my custom stuff in the map.\r\n\r\nSiro, for a lot of the cool pictures seen in this map.\r\n\r\n~Liko, for his botch picture. Botch too, i guess.\r\n\r\nCheezit, for allowing me to use the conversation about me using his penis. \r\n\r\nThanks Nipper, for all the inspiration \r\n\r\nAll the other people who supported me. \r\n\r\noh, and an additional bonus screenshot. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sleekupload.com/uploads/7_32.jpg\"><img src=\"http://sleekupload.com/uploads/thm/7_32_thm.jpg\" /></a></fieldset>"
