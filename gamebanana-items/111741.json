Both teams must fight by either shooting from one carraige to the other, or for the ones that want to be more risky. jump onto the oppositions train.\r\n\r\nThis map was a very difficult map to make.\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy this new production.\r\n\r\n(p.s) if your just viewing the map, first time you enter the map, please type kill into the console to activate the train. as things won't work unless the game starts.\r\n\r\ncredits: executive producer (working tunnels) : Sabr3wulf"
