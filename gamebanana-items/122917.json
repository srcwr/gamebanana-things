	"_sText": "My reason for making this instead of another linear was simply because there has been a serious lack of combat maps lately. In any server I join running combat, it's always the same 10 maps being run over and over. It felt to me like there needed to be a change, so I started this project. \r\n\r\nThis map features:\r\n-More guns than you could possible want\r\n-Two bomb zones\r\n-Incredibly smooth tele-boosts\r\n-A secrets lobby room\r\n-Various secrets around the main surf\r\n-Beautiful textures by Skyppy, Maxfx, and PhilipK\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that combat surfing makes a full recovery. I've seen a large influx of such servers with consistent populations lately, so I'm doing my part to keep them alive.\r\n\r\nHope to see you in game!\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 scaz.zaf.
