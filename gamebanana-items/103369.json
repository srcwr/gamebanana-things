In under a year they have built\r\nbarracks, housings, computer's, and underground tunnels. They are int the process of building\r\nstill underneath the whole city. But today the Terrorist know the CT's are coming. They will\r\ndo anything to hide what they have done, including blowing up there precious experiment.\r\nIts the CT goal to take down the Terrorist before they can do so. Be careful, they have underground\r\ntunnels which can quickly take them to each bomb site. Stop them dead in their tracks.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, SO many kinks and bumps. This is in big beta. Let me know what you guys think."
