You can enter the temple to encounter traps, if you can get past them you get the treasure.  There's also a huge volcano looming in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots were not modified at all, that's how it really looks in game.  Just make sure you have color correction enabled in options and you're running a DX9 card.\r\n"
