I went and got inspiration \r\nfrom one of my favourite surf maps of all time; surf_mushroom(_ksf). My \r\ngoal \r\nwas to capture the same style of surf of mushroom without all the \r\ngimmicky stuff it has. Also I added in alot of nature elements for the \r\ncozy feel. What isn't more happylove about someone so inspired by a map \r\nhe wants to make it into his own style just so he can enjoy it in some \r\nway even more :).<br></i><br>The map is somewhere between 45 seconds and 1 minute.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>CSGO port made by Granis after release (:."
