I don't ask for credit, a simple thank you will do.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>VMF Roads Prefabs file</legend>\r\nIn this file you will find all the roads I came up with. All curved roads were constructed based on 90, 180, 270 and 360 angles. Smooth curves of 45 degrees were not designed due to the level of difficulty they imply in the Source engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two diferent width measures, these are 256 and 512.\r\nAll main roads have two different styles, urban and rural , side by side.\r\nI tried to cover all possible style of roads, even two diferent styles of sloped curves are available, each with urban and rural style.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver 1800 objects were used.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>A map example is available</legend>\r\nThis map was also created by me, its a simple map scenario that uses these prefabs designed to kind of teach you how to use these in case you don't realise it. Both VMF and BSP included in the file.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>Download information</legend>\r\nIn this file you'll find 2 BSP files, 2 VMF files and 1 TXT file.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
