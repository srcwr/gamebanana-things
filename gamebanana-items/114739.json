This is only 2-3 days of work. \r\n\r\nA preview of the construction can be found <a target=blank href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTdz02w3ZdI \">here</a>. Youtube time lapse. \r\n\r\nThere are two versions of this map. This is the snow version that has it snowing with snow on the ground and the other one has it raining.\r\n\r\nTeams spawn on opposite sides of the map. The layout is balanced to where both sides are identical but the trees are a bit off. The lower level of the map has crates and a small water area. \r\n\r\nZip file includes .nav file \r\n"
