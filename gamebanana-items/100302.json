In this version a knife can destroy it which seems unrealistic.  I could have it where you could destroy the wall but then the wood frame would require a grenade or a gun of higher power(ex. Desert Eagle, Scout).  If enough people think this would make for better game play let me know.\r\n\r\nVideo from Original cs_onslaught:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/r8n5zo_j1js\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
