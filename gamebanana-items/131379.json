(well if you want to)\r\n9) DISCO LIGHTS !!!! (lol)\r\n\r\nThis map isnt going to scare the pants off you like other maps, but its very pretty, the gameplay is very balanced, and theres plenty of hiding spots.\r\n\r\nThis should be the only version your server runs, so go ahead and please update.\r\n\r\nPeople love this map :)\r\n\r\nPlease vote for this map if you like it, many people have said this is one of the best zombie maps theyve played."
