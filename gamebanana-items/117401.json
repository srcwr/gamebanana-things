Terrorists had captured this place after the elimination of the honey thief Jacques Hellmann by bounty hunter Peter Burmeister.\r\n\r\nThe counter-terrorists have to eliminate the terrorists and save the area.\r\nThe terrorists must kill the ct's and own this area.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the arms couldnÂ´t be delivered because of the weather. (There are all kinds of weapons without the Snipers).\r\n\r\nIt's my first Map. Do not be angry if the bots are a bit stupid. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n1: A overwiev of the map.\r\n2: Normal screenshot.\r\n3: Screenshot in the closed Bar.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
