You just   \r\nneed  to copy paste from this VMF file to your own map.\r\n\r\n-Tip: You can use ctrl+w to ignore groups, if you want 180 arch example, just select the brushes you want and copy them to your map.\r\n\r\n-Use cutting tool to cut cylinders to shape you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n-No need to credit me if you use these in your maps.\r\n\r\n-Arches are made with 8 wall size which provides good fitting with common 8 and 16 unit thick walls.\r\n\r\n-You should not use these as a world brushes, use func_detail instead."
