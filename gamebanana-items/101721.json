They had the technology and really, few years after, the first base ever on mars was built. They called it \"Curiosity\" after the rover that found all the materials. They inteded to do just a research on the materials and were against selling them.\r\nBut mining companies did not like this at all, they wanted to start mining everything that has a price._\r\n\r\n_They came up with a plan to send a small group of armed man in the base with two simple plans_\r\n\r\n_1) - Kill everyone who resists and get hold of the base_\r\n\r\n_2) - If plan 1) goes wrong, blow up the main core room or the hydroponics_\r\n\r\n**Will they succeed?**\r\n\r\nMap\r\n\r\n- Custom textures / models\r\n- Soundscapes / ambients\r\n- Radar\r\n- Optimized\r\n- max 64 players\r\n- nav file\r\n\r\n\r\nI put over 150 hours of work in this map and I would be probably remaking the whole thing, if I just had more time...\r\n\r\nAnyway enjoy it :)\r\n\r\n**_SkyppySDK_**"
