	"_sText": "This is a Gun Game map made for up to 28 people, ideally for 24 people and 4 extra spawnpoints to avoid people spawning on top of one another. Also there are no Buyzones.\r\n\r\nThis map is moderate speed for gameplay and is excellent for gungame as there are many areas for cover and areas to knife.  Note the Noob Box in the center of the map for those who wish to avoid combat and go hide somewhere."
