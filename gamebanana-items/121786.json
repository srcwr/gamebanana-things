Center - more powerful\r\n2. Outer - less powerful\r\n- There is a 4 way directional chevron arrow above each pad to launch you in that specific direction.\r\n- There are also chevrons on the walkable water areas that push you towards the bounce pads to launch you back on to the surf.\r\n- If you fall you are spawned in the middle of the map and you have to walk to the bounce pads (the chevron paths are accessible to go faster).\r\n- Each team is color coded:\r\nTerrorists : RED\r\nCounter-Terrorists : BLUE\r\n\r\n<b><u>Special thanks to...</u></b>\r\n- Spoz (incline supports)\r\n- Ryan Sterner (motivation)\r\n- All those who attended the beta tests on my surf server\r\n...sorry if I forgot anyone.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not ask for constructive criticism cause I honestly don't care, this map is the way I like it. Although, compliments are always welcome.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n--Buck Nasty\r\n\r\n<b>http://solidsurf.info/\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/bucknastysurf\r\n\r\nMap is in rotation @ my Surf Shack\r\nIP: css.nyfiber.net:30000</b>"
