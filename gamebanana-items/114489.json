	"_sText": "This map is of medium size and supports up to 32 players.  It is a dark map, so bots are extra hard to take down.  It is a two story building, and both floors are almost symmetrical.  The outer edges of the map consist of a maze, and the inner is a wide open arena.  Each corner has a ladder, and there are teleport locations in the middle for quick access to the top.  This map has a few very dark locations, but for the most part, it's fairly visible.  Players spawn with an auto shotty, a knife, 1 HE grenade, and 1 smoke grenade.  It's devoid of props, as it is intended to be a high speed, arena style battle.  I imagine it'd be fun running it on a deathmatch server.  I'm considering also doing a release with better visibility; feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\nUseless trivia:  The name is derived from the slang term for an auto shotgun (a street sweeper).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n"
