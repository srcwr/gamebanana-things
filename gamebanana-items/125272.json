	"_sText": "Newest bhop map by ChubbyFruit. HDR lightning, clear textures, beautiful level design, exploit-free, includes a few shortcuts. About a 30-hour project, hope it was worth it. I've been unsatisfied with some of the latest bhop maps, decided to make my own new one and I think it turned out as I would've wanted it to be. Give me any feedback for my further projects. Most of the textures made by myself, and just few ones from royalty-free image sites. Have fun !"
