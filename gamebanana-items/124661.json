	"_sText": "This short bhop map were created on-stream as a minor project while I'm working on other stuff. The usage of developer textures is the most obvious downside to the map, but I did not feel it was necessary to go all-out on detail for a project this small. \r\nThe map should be doable on virtually all settings, although I didn't include bhop triggers on the blocks, so newer players may be inclined to walk the blocks on scroll. \r\nThe map is divided into 4 minor sections, to smooth out learning of the map, but without the transition to be noticeable, unless you fall and fail, thereby getting teleported to the different checkpoints. \r\nIf you're interested in seeing the creation of these maps or bhop in general, I encourage you to follow my twitch channel: twitch.tv/artimous\r\n~Martin \"Aux\" Laursen"
