	"_sText": "Look at that pretty neon map! OH MAN. I just want to rub that purple brushwork all over my body and lay naked in a bathtub with it. A soapy bathtub. With hot, hot water. <i>If you catch my drift.</i>\r\n\r\nSo it's another smooth neon map by me, bclose. It is purple because I wanted to move more into warm colors with the pink/purple instead of doing another cool colored one. The next might be red, then orange, then yellow. I'll probably end up doing the whole spectrum eventually.\r\n\r\nDear Krusty, no I did not use your tutorial. I can do this from memory now. KTHANKS."
