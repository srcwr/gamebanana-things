	"_sText": "This probably took me a bit long.&nbsp;<br><br>It all started out being more or less likely, a casual stonewall map with default valve textures. When i was done after 5-6 weeks i decided to get a test for the map. Before i released it i needed some few fixes for the gameplay, so i let it stay in my folder in some weeks before i finally took myself together to fix the issues.&nbsp;<br><br>Although i ended up almost remaking the map completely. I started seeing the map from another perspective, and how things could be better. When i opened my eyes up for it, i realised i could add more detailed content and a way more immersive choice of lightning and overall environment from shadows. All the lights have been recolored a tons of times and got a more fitting brightness, yet the textures has been re-done a million of times to make them fit more together as the ones next to them in the same area/spot. Details around, over and under gameplay has got an organized choice of ideas, and there is most likely not a spot in the map that i didn't thought of adding more detail to. Gameplay started out being way more flat and basic. Now the map has more variety.<br><br>I simply learned to critique my own creations way more, and now the map is next to flawless regarding aligned textures and grid fitting creations.<br><br>I started the project 13 months ago, and has around 6 months of work.&nbsp;I'd say thanks to George and Panzer for support throughout&nbsp;the days. And for Tony Montana making a great map trailer.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/embed/ui4jJa-oUgI<br><br><br><br>"
