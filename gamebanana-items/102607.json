I've made around 3-4 little test maps (for CSS)\r\nthat I haven't released _anywhere_. I also have released\r\nA3 of a TF2 arena map to TF2Maps (Look for it! arena_kaboom)\r\nSo I do have small experience of Hammer. :P\r\nAs for gameplay, you know the drill - CTs spawn at the cottage\r\n(where the sauna is) and they have to protect the sauna from\r\nthe T's who are going to blow the whole place up\r\n(I don't think this scenario has ever made sense. Why are\r\nthey going to blow the sauna up?)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the credits:\r\n--\r\n-Zabidenu (me) for making the map\r\n\r\n-Komaokc for the awesome skybox texture\r\n\r\n-Pelihalli for having an AWESOME sauna map server!\r\n\r\n-Sedaix and Fhindu for detail critique\r\n\r\n--\r\nAs for installing,\r\n--\r\nsimply drop it to your \r\nSteam\\steamapps\\*USERNAME*\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWell, that was it! Now go play it and have fun!\r\n--"
