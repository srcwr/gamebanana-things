I have been trying a lot on soccer stuff, normally just did quick jobs, that weren't worth releasing them. This map was created for the extreme Soccer League, the XSL. If you haven't played soccer yet, search for servers with ka_soccer as map filter, it can be a lot of fun. The original stadium is the <a href=http://horadefutbol.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cancharojo1.jpg/>\"Nuevo Estadio Independiente\"\r\n</a> in Spain.\r\n\r\nEDIT: THIS IS THE FIX-VERSION, CHANGES INCLUDE PUBLIC SERVER-FUNCTIONALITY AND BUGFIXES!\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<b><div align=center>\r\n<hr><hr>INSTALLATION<hr><hr></b>\r\nJust put the <i>ka_soccer_xslcentre_fix.bsp</i> into your <i>CS:S</i> map folder, which is located at: <u>?:\\Program Files\\Valve\\Steam\\SteamApps\\*STEAM NAME*\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\\</u> or similar folder structures.</div>\r\n\r\n<b><div align=center>\r\n<hr><hr>ABOUT THE MAP<hr><hr></b>\r\nThe goal of the map is to use teamplay to score and assist goals.
