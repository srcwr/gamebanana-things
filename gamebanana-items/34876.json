Some missed important pathways were created from scratch (in particular - a way through a garage roof, path over the fence, etc.).\r\n\r\nWell... bots have opportunity to use all walkable ways now. They will make hot bloody meat for your stil life pleasure! :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original .nav-file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/158502).\r\n\r\nFight and Fun! Your remarks and feedbacks are always welcomed :-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Dinus Saurus (for high detailed and very realistic cottage-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nIt's a hotty-hotty-hotdog time! You motherfuckas think you're too good for these? :D"
