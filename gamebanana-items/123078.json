	"_sText": "This is my first map release, and really the first map I've made as well, though it's gone through numerous versions to get to the state it's in now.  It's the first idea I had for a map, that is a setting where the sun is setting, the lights have just come on, and you're in that in between area between light and dark.\r\n\r\nThis was designed to be a combat map, but since it was requested, I've included an _njv version as well.  There are three possible places where you can \"end\", but only two jail camps.  I hope to come back to this map another time, perhaps after my next release to add some secret areas and touch up on some of the content.\r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy it ~"
