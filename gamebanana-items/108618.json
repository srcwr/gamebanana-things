For now here is the CSS version of our map for your enjoyment. We have spent months trying to get the atmosphere and tone of the level to its current state and are now satisfied with it. The map has 64 spawn points, is HDR compatible, and includes a hand-tuned nav ensuring that bots use all the passageways allowed by the layout. We had a lot of fun testing this map both with the team and bots and hope you will have as much fun playing it on your server.\r\nEnjoy. "
