	"_sText": "A quarter baked escape map that was intended for a ZM escape scenario.  The idea was to have the players start in an office block, head to the subway, then to the hospital and then to a radio, which would then activate a nuke.  Ive left in the trigger_hurt, the button is on the top floor of the flight of stairs, should be easy to reconfigure as you see fit.  Use all of it or bits of it, I dont care, although Id like to see what you have done with it if it's used for release.  No bugs, just a clean chunk of brushes.  No cubemaps, just compiled lighting on high for testing purposes. I did intend HDR but, whatever."
