My first map actually.\r\nIt took me a few days to finish the map.\r\nThis map provides room for 2 to 24 players, there are several ways to get into the opponents fort.\r\nWhen you spawn you can choose ak-47 or m4a1, if you wont die your weapons will be kept.\r\nThere's an awp on the roof which is a bit tricky to grab.\r\nEach fort got a door which can only be opened from inside.\r\n\r\n***Changes with vers. 1.1***\r\nThe lamps inside are now gray/white colored.\r\nBoxes have been added to the roof.\r\nThe windows on the first floor are now bigger.\r\nFixed the textures.\r\nThe button which open the door have now been moved to the center where the guns are located.\r\nThe fire have been moved from the bridge to pillars in the water.\r\n\r\n***Changes with vers. 1.2***\r\nA ladder has been added so you can easier get to the roof.\r\nThe water texture have been changed so you now can see through it.\r\nThe sun has been moved so now it's much lighter outside.\r\nAn edge has been added so you can go from one roof to to the other.\r\nI've put nodraw texture on really many faces which appeared to increase the fps ^^\r\n\r\n***Changes with vers. 1.3***\r\nThe ladders have been replaced with proper prop ladders :D\r\nSome boxes have been added in the rooms.\r\nThe water now belong to the fishes.\r\nThe weapons are now inside the wall with glass texture.\r\nA few other props and decalls has also been added.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it =)"
