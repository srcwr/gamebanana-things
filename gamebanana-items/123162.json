There are 4 different secrets on the map, one giving you full health, another is a secret button for getting out of jail, another is one that gives you a choice between two sniper rifles, and the last you will have to figure out for yourself.  I have to give my main credit to Jacco, for his original creation, surf_ahooy_b1. And to -=Nyko=-A4J & FAJ for helping me test it and critiquing it. I have decompile protected the map.\r\n\r\nIf you are wanting to create a new version of this map, please add me to your xfire, and have some maps present that you have done to show me you are worthy! :D\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-Toxic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract to C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\<username>\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps"
