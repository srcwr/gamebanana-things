After a few minutes it will teleport you to a knife fight!\r\n\r\n25 seconds before the knife fight, anything that falls to the ground teleports back to the top of the map!\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This map is really big in terms of file size (55mb). Upload to your server if you want, but please dont complain about it as you have been warned. But I can gurantee this is a really really fun map!"
