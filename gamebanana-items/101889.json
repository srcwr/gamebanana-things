	"_sText": "This map is based around such movies/games as doom3, AVP and Terminator.  It is a large map containing non-solid walls/doors seen in the movie, Doom, an elevator, 2 bombsites with variouse ways of getting to them.  Due to the large size of this map, you will probably have to use bzip2 or something and use an external http server for your users to download the map.  Please Enjoy\r\n\r\nPS\r\nUnfortunatley bots cant navigate this map due to the nature of the doors etc."
