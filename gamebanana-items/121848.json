So i basically just decided to deleted un needed pbjects left over from other versions and use the nodraw texture drastically. I didnt on the first few versions becuase i never knew that i'd make this map so big...\r\n\r\n<b>The file size went from a huge 22mb to an okay 15mb. So it should be easier and faster  to host and download from peoples servers'."
