Different from other GG maps, it has good detail, lighting, and gameplay. Whowever, it also has its flaws. \r\n\r\nLighting is quite good, although the author only used static lighting, and sometimes, lights come out from no visible source. \r\n\r\nGameplay is really good, and the layout is superb, compared with other symetrical gg maps. There is alot of cover and sniping spots. The only thing that bothers me is that there are 2 misplaced terrorist spawnpoints, whether the author did that on purpose or forgot to delete them, I dunno. \r\n\r\nThe map is half good on performance, specially if you don't have a great computer. Sometimes you get 100 fps, but sometimes it drops drastically. The map itself is full of eye candy. Good brushwork and prop placement. Summing up, if you have a GG server, don't forget to add gg_underground_z to your map rotation.\r\n\r\nGraphical appeal: 8 \r\nLayout: 8.5 \r\nGameplay: 8 \r\n\r\nOverall rating:\r\n8.1\r\nExcellent!</FONT>\r\n\r\nBy <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/166588\">Teh_Pwnisher \r\n"
