While it might just look like another version of boatescape, it's not, and I made this entirely on my own. This map is very different from boatescape in many ways, one of which is that this one gets better FPS, and has an objective at the end. The canal aspect only plays a role in about 3/4 of the map, and then it's up to you to hold the fort at the end of the canal, hold up in a bunker, and wait for the nuke to go off.\r\n\r\nThis map took approx. 144 hours to create, and I'm very proud of it. While it might not be my most detailed work, I tried my best to make up for it in the lighting, ambiance, and gameplay. Please, before you assess, try out the map for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nAs always, comments, assessments, and stamps are more than welcome.\r\nJust keep in mind what I said above before you do any of that.\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy! =D\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho\r\nCreator of Headcrab Hunter 2\r\n<a href=\"http://www.headcrabhunter.com/\">www.headcrabhunter.com</a>"
