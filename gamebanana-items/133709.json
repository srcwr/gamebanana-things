I will not be posting up the SECOND release/version of [gg_armf_battlefield].\r\n\r\nMap Name: gg_armf_battlefield_v3\r\n\r\nChanges from v1:\r\n- Side ladders/boxes. (In order to get out (2 ways))\r\n- Boxes on the walkway/bridge.\r\n\r\nChanges from v1/v2:\r\n- Changed skybox/environmental lighting. (Which fixed a few mis-lit areas)\r\n- Made the \"Diamond/X-shaped\" metal borders on bridge and border more realistic. (You can now shoot through them, and they act as \"metal\". (Which fixed a bug on my VISTA system, which made them generally \"spaz/glitch\".\r\n\r\n*Note: Because of my computer's monitor/brightness settings, the map may appear differently on your monitor than it would on mine, however, because of the changed lighting, the map looks WONDERFUL)\r\n\r\nI am very proud of how this map FINALLY turned out. There are no leaks, no errors, and the map looks wonderful.\r\n\r\nAgain, the map should not lag on your server/LAN. This map has been tested on both low and high quality on my XP desktop, which is under the given requirements to run CS:S, and has been tested on high quality on my Vista laptop.\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism and suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks to TempletonPeck for giving the suggestions on VERSION 1! The map wouldn't have been as nice without the suggestions. Once again, thanks!"
