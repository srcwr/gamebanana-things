	"_sText": "##Mini Dust Survival\r\n<i>A Source revamp of my classic Zombie Plague map!</i>\r\n_________________________\r\nI remember I made this map in CS1.6 for ZP like 4 years back, and it was so much fun. I decided to revamp it as best as I could remember (seeing as I removed it from FPSB a while back for some reason :P)\r\n\r\nThis is in beta, so there are a few known issues which will be taken care of in the future.\r\n<br>- Upper box stack is vulnerable to escaping the map\r\n<br>- (Regarding above issue) More player clips need to be added\r\n<br>- Wagon is clippy and you can get stuck on it before spamming the jump key out of it\r\n<br>- A couple decals are buggy\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThe map is optimized as well as possible, so there shouldn't be any FPS issues. There will also be a 3D skybox in the future.\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n<br>\r\n<Br>\r\n<img src=\"http://www.midnightonly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/forbidden-zone-1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"240\">\r\n<br>\r\n#King Fausto of the Sixth Dimension approves!"
