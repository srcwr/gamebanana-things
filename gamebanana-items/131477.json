	"_sText": "This is my take on the zm_cbble map. I've played a lot of different versions, and they all either looked terrible, or were littered with illegal spots for Unlimited Ammo servers. So i got tired of playing the one of the redux's on Plaguefest, and made this redux of it. The dimensions aren't exactly the same since the original was built on a grid of 1 (a lot of things were in odd dimensions)\r\n\r\nThere is only 1 secret in the map, and it is the cactus gun that i made upon request. The teleport only works once, and once you get in there, it teleports you out after 5 seconds."
