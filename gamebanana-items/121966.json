	"_sText": "<b><u>Readme:</u></b>\r\n\r\nIts my very first map ever ! \r\nI never used Hammer before but i wanted to make a own surfmap. So i read some tutoruals here on FPS and SOLIDSURF (and google ^^) and started with this map. \r\nSo credits to all the guys who posted good tutorials. And of curse our players on our speedserver [ 85.14.216.193:27016 ] (20 betaversions to the final... puh!).\r\nAnd Valve for all dusty things (textures,models,ect.)\r\nMap made in april/may 2007 (80-90 hours).\r\n\r\n\r\n<b><u>Mapinfos:</u></b>\r\n\r\nIst a dust-styled surf map in two stages. Its a big map so i recommend the MAPTIME TO 4.0 or more! \r\nThe first stage leads you to a small platform and second one leads you to weapons or (lower one) directly to the battlefield/jail. \r\nThere is a bombspot at the end of the map and the jail can be escaped with a teammate ^^\r\n\r\n\r\n... so please give me some nice comments and have fun with this map - Rebell <img src=http://www.deltaforceteam.de/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif>"
