I have class and than a 7:30 curtain call for a show I am in, so I may not get back to this until tomorrow sometime!)\r\n\r\nAs of right now, this map is pretty much complete.  I plan to add a 3d skybox when I release the final version, and maybe add HDR.  Opinions are welcome, and anything else you wish to say is also welcome!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for suggestions/comments on it as it is in its beta stage!  Thanks!"
