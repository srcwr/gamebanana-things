It worked, we sniped back and forth at each other until I called a truce so we could clear the bodies off the field. Now we are (*AHEM*) friends again. Therefore I have given her a credit in the creation of this prefab. Please ensure that you DO NOT give me a credit in your maps if you use this prefab. Included are one custom texture, a really crappy one too. Enjoy\r\n\r\nPRESS THE BUTTON AND ENJOY A DELIBERATE SERVER CRASH\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions; \r\nYOU KNOW WHERE TO STICK IT"
