Includes soundscapes for those who prefer to surf with their sound on. The surf is a compact style with a mix of 2-way and 4-way symmetry on the main map. The bonus is fully comprised of 8 way symmetry.<br><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/members/1647281\">Draph</a> for creating the credits and main title board texture in spawn. Thank you to Chrissybear + wife for motivating me to map and helping me settle with a name. Thank you to <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/members/1486261\">Bocuma</a> for showcasing this map (in a slightly earlier development state).<br><br>This is my first surf map."
