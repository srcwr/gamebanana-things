	"_sText": "I just love the map cs_assault, but I much prefer to play GG, so i though I should make an version of assault for it.\r\n\r\nThis is my second released map, and if you look at my other one you can see the improvement as I have just been playing with hammer for about a year, really getting to grips with it with out releasing pointless unfinished dev textured full bright maps. \r\n\r\nThat's another thing I hate about GG maps, <b>most</b> people put no time into them, and I am sick of Dev Textures.\r\n\r\nThis was a big project for me, taking just over a month and I really like the result.\r\n\r\nI want to give out a big thank you to <a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/278180>Cheebs</a> as he offered to test my map out before I released it and look for errors and things that could be improved and did a great job of it. Lots of respect for him.\r\n\r\nIf anybody puts this map into rotation on there GG server, please let me know as I would love to play it with you guys.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, If you guys find any more errors let me know and I will fix them, this is only in beta stage. In the final version I am going to try and add a Radar Image. \r\n\r\n\r\n<center><b><font size=\"2\">*** Please Download and Rate! Looking for lots of feedback, so I can improve the map and my skills! ***</font></B></center>"
