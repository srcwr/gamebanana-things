	"_sText": "A fun map where the CTs must defend the centre bombsite, the yellow arrows are boosters so everyone is flying around shooting each other and you can surf up pyramids, chase people, try reach the top of pyramid, try reach sniper points etc etc\r\nA unique concept. I'd imagine it is very ideal for the DM mod, but should work just as well in normal mode.\r\n - My first map ever, hope ya likes it! :)"
