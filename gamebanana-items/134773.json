	"_sText": "This favela-themed map, with its alleys, stairways and rooftops, has a nice balance of close- and long-range, vertical and horizontal gameplay. Rush through the long streets around the favela or sneak through the alleyways and across the roofs. Each team also has access to the roofs of two taller houses, from which they can snipe upon unsuspecting foes.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and if you're putting this on your server, be sure to post me the IP - I'd love to play with you!"
