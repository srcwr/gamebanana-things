	"_sText": "For the millions of mgs fans around the world, this ones for you!\r\nShadow Moses Island in Alaska's Fox Archipeligo was attacked and captured by next generation special zombies being lead by members of Foxhound! Escape from the docks all the way past the communications tower to Metal Gear Rex's lair and activate his railgun to kill the zombies!\r\n\r\nThis is just alpha, to see ppl's initial impressions feedback. I still need to optimise it, and i realise there's overflow. I started work on this about a year ago and gave up after i couldnt optimise it, if i can't this time ill let the community do it, if they want. Before you critise the textures for perhaps being ugly and low res, you might want to bear in mind that this is based on a ps1 game, and i wanted to evoke a ps1 era atmosphere. In this updated version i improved the commanders room and changed the snow texture and i'll try to optimise it soon if i can."
