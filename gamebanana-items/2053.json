	"_sText": "# History\r\n\r\nThe SuperSolenoid Reactor is an old project developped by DTTCORP research center. Unfortunately due to dissolution the project couldn't have been finished. 42 years later scientist give it a new go by combining this powerful concept with the new technology. The result is stunning. A reactor capable of supplying a whole power armor without instability AND provide a powerful short-range magnetic type weapon by overloading the palladium arc and releasing all it's power at once. \r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING : Being in front of the reactor during an energy spike is LETHAL.\r\n\r\nThe SuperSolenoid first aimed to grant independancy energy-wise. It now fullfil it's first goal and more, is now a weapon.\r\n\r\n# For real\r\n\r\nI wasn't really sure if I could submit this but Tom seemed ok when I asked one week ago : http://www.gamebanana.com/wips/39243\r\nSo it's now an armor for your maps on a mannequin. It can be cool in a technological complex as a showcase of their work etc...\r\n\r\nYeah... I know it may be too different from what you expect but the rules are wide enough to let this pass imo. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you'll like it. I spent more times than usual on this :3\r\n\r\nPS : If you find a bug, as always report it to me so I can fix it. Thanks !\r\n\r\nPPS : If peoples want I can provide a version mannequin-less."
