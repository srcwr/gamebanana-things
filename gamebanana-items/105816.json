(lol =P) What i mean with that is: \r\n1) it is the meaning that you hold the line and just move around in your own end, but if you want, you can rush across the open space.\r\n2) There is only 2 guns per spawn point, so don't use your ammo up to quickly!!\r\n\r\nSome facts:\r\n\r\nTextures: Dev, or ag as some call them.\r\nWeapons: lots of P90, 2 MP5, 2 UMP, 1 Galil, 1 Famas, and some nades.\r\nSecrets: Yes, there is 2 scouts \"hidden\" some where in the map. \r\nNav file: Of course :)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map. :)\r\n\r\n-Twix'ed out"
