So i just said, screw it, Ill upload it anyway. So sorry guys for the 99% done map.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Stay up as long can without falling.\r\n\r\nWhen the glass turns purple, you better get off that panel. You have 3 seconds before it breaks and you fall to your death.\r\n\r\nThat is basically it.\r\n\r\n-keto\r\n\r\n"
