	"_sText": "A 10 minute made minigame with 2 teams on opposite sides with giant ladders and knifes only as spawns there are 2 guns at the bottom of the ladder so its a race to grab them but then you can't aim them until you climb back up the ladder, so Its risky trying to get all the way back up. Simple but fun with lots of players. Comment and rate please."
