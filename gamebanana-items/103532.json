The physics engine inspired me to make a different kind of map involving killing players with objects istead of directly using firearms. If played with the right people, this map can be very fun and is different from the normal type of gameplay.\r\n\r\n     You can, of course, use the gun to shoot the other team and kill them, but if you want to have fun and play the map as it was meant to be played, players will instead try to eliminate the other team by shooting the legs of the platforms and making them fall."
