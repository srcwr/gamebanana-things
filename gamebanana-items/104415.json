It has a proper story fitting the map's name and theme.\r\n\r\nTerrorists try to get to the bombsites as CTs spawn near them, and try to hold that area. either from close quarters or sniper range. theres a small office complex on the middle, and terrorists can get there from ducts also.\r\n\r\nSee a walktrough <A href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOCh_svzh3A\">video</A> of the map.\r\n\r\nSome stuff: working doors, sounds, NAV for bots & areas and Radar screen\r\n\r\nBads: i couldnt get HDR working properly so you cant use it in this map. (Sorry!)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Kurrus for making the radar and helping me test it!\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading! Please comment and assess! :)\r\n\r\nUPDATED! (1.7.08)\r\n\r\nBots should act nice and clean now thanks to chizbone, who properly NAV mapped this map.\r\nThank you!"
