Lol!\r\nEveryone on the server seemed to like the map and graded it 9+.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VERSION 3 FEATURES</b>\r\n\r\n- Improved and modified lights\r\n- Control Tower\r\n- Pit Ladder\r\n- Ski Hut\r\n- Underground Tunnel\r\n- 3 Teleports\r\n- Doors now work properly\r\n- New Sky\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the new version,\r\nOmena :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map can be found here!\r\n66.150.155.213:27015"
