	"_sText": "This is just a map that I kinda threw together and in the end, loved how it looked. The main goal I had while making this map was to just make it out of only brick textures. So overall, I think the all brick texture turned out to look really good, much better than I imagined.\r\n\r\nI tried to test it with bots, but the bots were just plain stupid and were jumping around against the walls.\r\n\r\nI have tested this map in a game in a real server with real people, and it is probably the fastest paced map i've played. It is almost literally insane because of the speed of gameply in this place. A few responses we got back from the map while testing it for the first time in a server were \"Insane\", \"crazy\", \"Kinda like something out of UT\", \"amazing\", \"Keep you on your toes at all times\". The only thing the people didn't like about it is that it's one of those maps that you have to had played before to play good in it, but after a couple rounds, you learn the map fairly well and find it easy to navigate from place to place.
