	"_sText": "This is my 3rd online released map, it was a pain in the a** doing some stuff here, and solving some anoying bugs (like displacements not sewing), but I think all of them have been solved, even edited the bot navigation file so bots can go downstairs (but for some reason they don't go very often), the map supports up to 64 players. Soon I'll have info about a new map I'm still sketching... Happy frags!"
