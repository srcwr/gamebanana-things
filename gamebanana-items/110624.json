It features:\r\n\r\n- Moving trains\r\n\r\n- Working grenade spawning machine, 1 for each side\r\n\r\n- Kinda detailed 3D skybox\r\n\r\n- City17 feel, I tried to make it as close as I could.\r\n\r\nMap is for 5 vs.5 because it's enough for this map. Trains are dangerous, so watchout! I maybe support HDR later, not now. This map was supposed to be 2-3 hours map but I wanted to make it detailed\r\nand all so it took 4 days, every day I worked 1.5h.\r\n\r\nBUGS: -\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: This is re-added, nothing else.."
