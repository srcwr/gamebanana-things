Even though the map might not look too good, I think it turned out okay.\r\n\r\nThe map has:\r\n1 Smoke-trail\r\n1-Flash-trail\r\n1 Deagle-trail\r\n\r\nThe end of the map contains: Kill all(Troll), Frags (99) and a hard bonus (99+ frags)\r\n\r\nTo finish the map, the thing you mostly need is bhopping, so if you're good at that, you propably can finish my map. :)\r\n\r\nI didn't add any music too the map itself, since I personally hate when the music is disturbing my own music from Spotify."
