	"_sText": "Here is a new bombsite - hostage rescue map!\r\n\r\nI believe the map works great.\r\nA maximum of 32 players are able to play the map at once. It has several props, a good lightning, good shadows, and some effects (fire,smoke).\r\n\r\nFor any mistakes please do not flag the map, rather comment and I will upload new files as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nDidn't really know on what section to put this map since there is a bombsite and a hostage rescue goal, so I went with Fight Yard, since its more about killing all your opponents first. \r\n\r\nI like this map, so I intend to make a night version of it. (gonna make it soon) To install this map simply put the new cstrike folder over the old one and overwrite.\r\n\r\nComments, suggestions and ratings are welcome! :P\r\n\r\n(the map is also very good for playing with boots)"
