But as some have discovered, Cremecorp has a secret. It recovers the ubitquious filling with material from raw sewage. \r\nFrom an ingenious system devised by an expert architect, a four-step process takes the softest parts of the sewage and ferments it into fresh creme filling. Disgusted Terrorists has decided to stop this process, either midway in the processing step, or in the final step of export. Due to an anonymous tip, Cremecorp has mobilized it's \r\nprivate security force and is ready for the attack.\r\n\r\nI've been working on this for a while, but it's my first release. \r\nI think it's fun to play.\r\n\r\nANY BUGS/SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE EMAIL ME AT: sniperx87@hotmail.com\r\n\r\ncredits: MarkQ, Valve for the models/textures."
