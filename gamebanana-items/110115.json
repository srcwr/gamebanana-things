Yeah, it's a knife fight. There's an\r\ninvisible platform that connects both ledges - you can see\r\nthe start of it at the middle of your spawn area. It goes\r\nstraight across to the other side, and it gets wide around\r\nthe middle. Watch yourself, though. There are holes in the\r\ncenter platform, and it's real easy to lose your footing.\r\nThe acid will kill you instantly, so be careful.\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. Good luck.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nNotes:\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nIt's a really small map in terms of file size, but can support up to 40 players... sorta. Works really well with less than 20 players. It's a lot of fun to play, since even when you know exactly where the holes are it's still really easy to fall in. Definitely not a \"high score\" map, by any means. If you're incapable of laughing even when you're dying, you might wanna try something else."
