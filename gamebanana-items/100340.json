	"_sText": "<b>CS_PIPELINE</b> by FragNaT1c (released October 2009)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The author of this winter atmospheric assault-themed map managed to create open space with the wide view on which would be possible various styles of military actions: from the sniping hunts to the closed combats. We appear in the snow-covered territory with complex of office buildings located lengthways a site of the Arctic oil pipeline. There are, of course, a lot of shot by snipers areas, but CTs certainly can bring hostages, avoiding open spaces, making the way through a underground tunnels and corridors, taking cover behind buildings and details of the landscape.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In spite of the fact that at creation of the map was used only standard materials (models, textures), it looks quite atmospheric and realistic (more or less). Anyway, battles proceed here very hazardously (imho).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>A necessary attributes for comfortable gameplay (mini-map on radar, nav-file for bots) are embedded in the bsp-file. Unfortunately, the nav-file is simple auto-gen (not optimized manually), though it's more or less playable.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Well... Great Thanks to FragNaT1c for his Nice Work!"
