	"_sText": "    This map was made for a LAN party where team work is key. This map feel is mid to close quarters combat, with many alternate routes so your team shouldn't get bottle necked.\r\n    The T's spawn in a deserted under ground parking garage. And the CT's spawn in a small park. There are 2 bomb sites. One on a helicopter landing pad filled with crates. And the other in a small industrial building.\r\n    The player can use the ground or climb on to cat walks for a height advantage.\r\n\r\nThis map was created by th3HAWKER. Have fun."
