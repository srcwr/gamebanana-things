Felt that other servers might appreciate the 2 months of work I put into it.<br><br>Map is about 30 seconds with 3 bonuses by TheJazzAgent, SNC, and Koga73. <br><br>I hope whoever finds this map enjoys it. Had about 15 testers on the map, all of them found the map to be fun to run and fairly pleasant on the eyes. <br><br>Thank you to all my testers. <br><br><br><br>Map is t2 and 3500 maxvel. Ready to be zoned. <br>"
