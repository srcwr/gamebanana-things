	"_sText": "Map has been changed ALOT! Weapon room has ammo now, buttons make noise now, trani has more oepn so easier to jump in, 6 different secrets to rooms or buttons. Map has over 20+ teleports some that you cannot see that are hidden, some will take you to death rooms so have fun trying them all out. FPS has gone up a bit and runs alot smoother. Alot has changed so enjoy.\r\n\r\nEdit : Map is alot brighter then shows just very poor quility pictures. Map will run better without zombie_fog!\r\n\r\nXFIRE - Sneakysuggiesnoopie"
