The humans objective: activate all the generators and then defend the main core in the fifth stage.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nThe map tries to keep the shape and gameplay of the classic maps:\r\n- No mass teleports for force players to move ahead.\r\n- No invisible walls.\r\n- All ways are connected with no teleports.\r\n- Wide paths\r\n- Intense action due the lack of helps to the human team\r\n\r\nThe map, although, includes modern maps features:\r\n- Human items (stages 2,4,5)\r\n- Zombie items (stage 3,5)\r\n- Stages system\r\n- Extreme mode\r\n- Player controlled boss\r\n- Event system\r\n\r\n**Event system**\r\nHidden and visible events may be triggered by players during the stages 1,2,3 and 4. These will alter the gameplay in the stage 5 and will determine how easy or difficult will be to defend the core and save the humanity.\r\n\r\n**Extreme**\r\nExtreme difficult will be enabled after stage 5 is completed.\r\nCompleting extreme difficulty will be considered completing the map at 100%\r\n\r\n**Notice**\r\nMap is still in development process and the balance may not be as good as I wanted."
