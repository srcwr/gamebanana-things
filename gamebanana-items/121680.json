And, this is my first map, so plz dont give me hard feedback, it's just for fun.\r\n\r\n<B> Alright, now i figured i should take a look at my old map and i got a BIG laugh.. The portals were messed up, the skybox had some serious holes (causing the lack of lightning and bad water :P ), and everything was creepy. But, since this was my first map, i decidet to fix it. Compile time, 17 mins and 26 secs..</b>\r\n\r\nSOZ for the boob pic on the CT surf, that crappy map stopped working, and I can't remove her.. So plz dont flame me for that."
