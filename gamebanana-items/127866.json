	"_sText": "This is the second version of my map crazyconveyors.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest changes include:\r\n\r\n- no fall damage\r\n- bonus stage for awp\r\n- skybox\r\n- proper lighting\r\n- teleports\r\n- 1 whole new stage\r\n- console talk\r\n- minor stage changes\r\n- glass on top for no cheating\r\n- deagle\r\n- all ammo changed to 1000\r\n\r\nAgain, this map is able to spawn 74, 37 t's, 37 ct's. To win, race through all 17 stages to reach the end and pick up a gun where you can simply ride a conveyor back to the other stages and kill everyone left alive. At the end, there is also a newly added bonus (which is very hard, but definetely possible) where one can obtain an awp if beaten sucessfully. This map can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes to beat, depending on how good are you. If you think you are good enough to beat all 17 stages and 1 bonus then download this map and try it out! Its great for big mini game servers!"
