Just upload it and give it a try! You won't regret it! As you learn the map, and get better at surfing it will become more enjoyable and more fun!\r\n\r\nEven the map is fullbright, I made sure that all textures have anugh contrast so you can differentiate between the surf block the ground, the walls, etc. I tried adding lighting, but due to the massiveness of the map it was very hard to get right.\r\n\r\nA small video showcasing the ending, and that it is possible\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/40vqxhQwyws?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/40vqxhQwyws?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nSo at the end, escape quickly, but do not fail or you will die :p\r\n\r\n\r\nA complete round, which was won. (Not my video)\r\n<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/A2hcTb1wQEM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/A2hcTb1wQEM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nHeli's HP = 225(number of players that entered the lobby)\r\nSo, if zombies spawn from the spawning zone, then they do get counted twice. It is alright, don't worry about that\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Eugenio 'Motanum' Roman\r\nBugs, comments, suggestions to agent_2114@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nMore maps from me to come\r\n\r\nSponsored by ]Hell[ Servers and Syndicate Gamers\r\n\r\nSee screenshots\r\n\r\nInstallation, just paste the all of the files in the rar on your maps folder for counter strike source\r\n\r\nDefault should be Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\Account_Name\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nNote, ze_ApertureScience_OB got trashed because of ported models, if you want the map for your server just pm for a link to mediafire"
