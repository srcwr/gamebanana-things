	"_sText": "It is in the beta testing phase and\r\nthat will close soon that is why I need to get the\r\nword out, the more eyes testing it the more polished I\r\ncan make it. \r\n\r\nMap Name: de_lochsBETA3\r\nRelease Date: 1/22/05 (Final version TBA)\r\n\r\nTwo bombsites, supports 32 players. Bombsite B is the\r\nFish ladder viewing area, bombsite A is the control\r\nroom. The basic idea behind the map is that there is a\r\ntown, vigville which has a set of lochs like the\r\npannama canal but smaller. Terrorist have targeted the\r\nlochs because it is a vital part of\r\nthe vigville economy but is also a minor tourist\r\nattraction. \r\n\r\nI did some custom textures for the map such as Larys\r\nLard Bar a snack bar that features fish bricks instead\r\nof fish sticks =) The overall flow of the map is\r\nreally ballanced and everyone that has tested it so\r\nfar has liked it.\r\n\r\nSo download it, play it, let me know what you think.\r\nIf you think it is worth it to post news then so be\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSteam forum thread here:\r\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=231478"
