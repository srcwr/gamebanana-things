	"_sText": "For this map i tried to make a copy of the zombie panic source map zpo_cinema, and i think i have made a good job. This map is in a city enviroment and has a setup looking like the de_dust2. Terrorist starts outside, and has the mission to blow up one of three saloons. A and B bombsite are both saloons. There are fast ways to get to the bombsites, but those will shure be guarded by ct's. So i made he map in three floors: basement, first floor, secong floor. The basement is a great way to get behind ct lines and take em by surprise, but be carful as a t, you never know if there is a ct hiding in the darkness of the basement. the first floor is entr√©, saloons and links between them, this is the floor were both the bombsites are located. The second floor is not big, but you have a great overview. I also have a outside enviroment. There is not much taken place out there but, it's a nice and goodlooking area where you choose wich way you want to go, as a t. The ct's starts in the basement. There you can fast reach the bombsites. The map includes alot of stairs, because of the 3 floors, so be awake and watch for enemies around every corner. There are two openings to every bombsite, so there is hard to hold a bombsite at your own. Make shure you arenot running around like a freak and jumping around, the enemies will hear you, trust me. That was it and i hope you will enjoy my map! =)"
