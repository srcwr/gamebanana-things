FAJ is aware and approves.\r\n\r\n- There are \"bounce pads,\" with a red bullseye, that launch you high in the air.\r\n- The first single one shoots you to the hanging shotguns.\r\n- The pair after the straight ramps shoot you up to a buyzone.\r\n\r\n- The jail releases every 30 seconds up to the first minute and a half.\r\n\r\n- There is a secret room/hall that can be opened by triggering 3 buttons. Once 3 bucks spawn hit the GAJ button to open.\r\n- You can walk through each vmf picture and either find a weapon or be teleported to a specific secret area (some are based on the map of the vmf).\r\n\r\n- I am aware that there can be low fps surfing down the side ramps before the m4-ak platform. It should not drop below 30. This is the only place where fps could be a problem.\r\n\r\n- There should be no bugs, errors, nothing. I had 2 open betas on my server so it's good to go.\r\n\r\n- Comments/compliments are always welcome, including constructive criticism!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n--Buck Nasty\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.solidsurf.info/\r\nhttp://cstrike.waspnest.net/\r\n"
