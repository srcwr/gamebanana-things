So quiet and peaceful, but then this one container arrived and the massacre started.\r\n\r\nNow its your Turn. Try to survive as long as u can. Baricade yourself in a house, climb on a roof or just hide yourself in the big underground area. \r\n\r\n\r\nA Note to Server Administrators:\r\nThis map has a point_servercommand inside it. Without it the boats will not work and the cannon won't function properly. If you have a point_servercommand override plugin, then you'll need to make a .cfg for this map with sv_turbophysics 0 in order for the boats and cannon to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay this Map on this server:\r\n[-b!p-] Deutscher Schlachthof @ FastDL [- blood-is-power.de -]\r\nIP: 78.46.95.172:27615\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nPls Download, Asses and Comment\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
