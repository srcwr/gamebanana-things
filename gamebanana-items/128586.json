	"_sText": "Okay, so I really like this map, its only downfall were the doors. It usually lead to door spamming and then everyone would get killed by the AFK killer.\r\n\r\nSo, I removed most of the doors, fixed a few errors and kept all the sounds and textures in place.\r\nThe only doors left are like 4 near the end, which I increased the opening speed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not take any credit for this map, all credit goes to jake1002 (http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/276564)\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed problem with no respawnblocker."
