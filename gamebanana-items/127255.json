It's completely playable and I will add custom endings to the map :)\r\n\r\nI'm sorry but It wouldn't let me upload my bigger size pictures, i made them 640x480 but they went over 800kb so I had to cut them alittle..\r\n\r\nJust now the map is fullbright, but in (maybe) the next version it will be completely diffrent :)"
