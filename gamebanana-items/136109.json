	"_sText": "Initially intended for a GunGame map, then decided on a DE map, now it's back to being a gungame map ;)\n\nSpecial thanks to Karatekaefer for the skybox and nipper for the hay texture\n\nSmall alleys that can only be seen through, make this a pop n shoot around corners type map. Also jumppads ( u must jump when using, or else they just throw you) which can send you in a few directions, depending how you air-strafe. Piles of hay protect you from falling damage (think assassins creed), it will still sound like you got hurt but no damage is given (limitation).\n\nDE version has underground area which was taken out for the gungame verison."
