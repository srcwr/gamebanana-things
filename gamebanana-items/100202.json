	"_sText": "This a variant of the FINAL release of cs_newoffice made to meet VIA Community's requests.\r\n\r\nI made this map initially for pleasure, but after I understood that it should be interesting for all the fps community. So I published it hoping it will be played by someone else.\r\n\r\nThis map differs from cs_newoffice_final because:\r\n- there are no weapons;\r\n- hostages are in different floors;\r\n- there are 45 spawns per team;\r\n- there is a great fps improvement, thanks to a lot of time spent in optimizations;\r\n- there are some layout modifications (wider stairs, new garage entrance & new alley);\r\n- there are new textures for doors;\r\n- there are new reflective textures for ground and walls.\r\n\r\nGood frags.\r\n\r\nzzdd"
