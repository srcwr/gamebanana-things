In this re-make, I didn't change many things except those that I thought would create a better experience for those who like to Snipe and Rush. This is supposed to be a \"Cleaner\" version so, the map has multiple changes that should enhance the game play to all Pro/New Two Tower's fans!\r\n\r\nAll Feedback Is Welcome!"
