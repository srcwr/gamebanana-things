I think its the most fun map i've made so far so hopefully you guys think the same. It has somewhat the same theme as bhop_infernum since out of all of my maps that was my favorite theme to do. Also, i had alot of trouble with packing for some reason so if anything is missing please tell me. I tested it though and im pretty sure i got it all.<br><br>30-40s"
