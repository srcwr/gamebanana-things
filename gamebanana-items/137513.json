The style is something between de_dust and cs_italy and I have used many late hours. I have optimized the map from 18 MB down to 12MB and it's my hope that it will run good on your computer. \r\n\r\nOn and AMD XP 1800+ whiff GeForce4 Ti and no specular it run super! \r\n\r\nGunGame\r\nI have testet gg_zone on GunGame 4 and for me it's a lot off fun, whiff bots. Yes the map is optimized for botplay. If the bots are smart! - Then the map design is good. \r\n\r\nThere is no buy zone and know weapons in the map, so unless you run it on GunGame it will not be fun in the long run! \r\n"
