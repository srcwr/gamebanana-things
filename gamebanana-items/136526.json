(If you find any post and I will fix A.S.A.P)\r\n\r\nThis map was created because of inspiration from the COD4 map \"showdown\" (NOTE: This map is not copied and is different in many ways.) This map uses the general outline of Showdown but the detailed layout is very different. This map contains loads of good battle areas. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHANKS: \r\n\r\nThis map would not have been possible without constant advice and help from my good friend DoM. ( smucky_7 on fpsbanana.) I would also like to thank Golebi for hosting some tests. =D\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES!:\r\n\r\nIf you are downloading please comment in this format:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\nCons:\r\nImprovment: \r\n\r\nAlso feel free to give me ideas for a new map. (any type... gg,mg, I dont care =D)\r\n\r\nIf yoy download and add to your server please also post ur Server IP.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURENT SERVERS RUNNING MY MAP!:\r\n\r\n203.14.173.212:27015\r\n\r\nTHANKZ,\r\n        Raffa."
