	"_sText": "Hey guys! This is my first map that I've spent a lot of time on.  It is a short Tier 2 linear map with 2 bonuses.  The goal of the map was to create fun surf for low and high skill surfers.  There are a few skips throughout the map for competitive times and even an easter egg ;) (nothing server owners have to worry about  ;) )  There will be a Surf Cinema video coming out later this week and contact me to let me know what you thought. Thanks - TruMatrix"
