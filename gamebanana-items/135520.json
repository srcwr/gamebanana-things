	"_sText": "Gg_labrace has a lab/chemical plant theme. 32 Spawnpoints but I'd suggest no more than 20 for the best gameplay. The .rar also includes the default bot nav file.\r\n\r\nThis map will have 2 versions. The next will feature a button activated killing mechanism, like poison fumes for example, that players will have to race to (hence the name gg_labrace). Whoever is not in the safe room after the button is activated will die (and lose a lvl for suicide if thats activated on your GG server). Ill post updates on that when I begin :)"
