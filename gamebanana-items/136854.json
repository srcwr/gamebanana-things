	"_sText": "This map is a remake of aim_shotty. I love aim_shotty that is why i decided to redo it. The only things that are original are the catwalk and the low walls. I added a lower section to the map. I made it dark so you can get some knifes in. I also added buy zones and removed the ahotties from the map. So all you fightyard freaks out there can enjoy as well. I hope you all enjoy the map. It is redone in our trademark style. Look for more maps to come from [cis]Studios. I hope you all enjoy. Thank you for downloading and checking it out."
