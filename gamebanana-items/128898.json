	"_sText": "**2/2 Major Update: Can now fire all weapons continuously without need to reload.**\r\n\r\nThis virtual shooting range aims to improve your muscle memory, reactions and aim, through repetition and target practice. Simply spawn, pick your weapon and compete against up to 5 other team-mates in a head to head battle of champions. \r\n\r\nYou can tailor session time to suit yourself: easily select from either first to 25/50/75/100 targets to win. The system will automatically cycle through targets at random, giving you that genuine flick-shot opportunity every time. Anyone who completes 100 or above will enjoy bonus music and credits. Defeated players will automatically be slayed. \r\n\r\nThe round will not begin unless all players have \"readied up,\" by shooting the red light in the center of the cross-hair. The map will detect how many players are in-game and is fun solo or with any number up to 5 people.\r\n\r\nEach player can chose from Ak/M4/Awp/Deagle with 999 clip capacity, or alternatively purchase something from the buyzone. \r\n\r\nWhether you use it for fun or training, I hope you will enjoy my map and hopefully become an even better player!"
