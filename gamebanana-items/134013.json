It has a basement, two water pools at each base, a second floor, and a sniper tower for each base. There are 24 spawn points (I know, not 32, that would be way to many players for this map though.)\r\n\r\nI hope you guys like it.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 is out, please check out this link if you want the updates.\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/69250\r\n"
