If you let go. It will drop fast so keep clicking on the mouse1 to land\r\n\r\nAll the doors are done by a button and it will restart at 10 sec. then it will close.\r\n\r\nPS: If you are going to but this on your map. Keep the Helicopter in the same way as it is. If you move it like right or left to change the view. I don't think the doors will open the right way. So you might have to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change things around you can.\r\n\r\nThe vmf and bps files are in.\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Have fun!!!!!<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n\r\n"
