	"_sText": "I did not make this map.  This map is being used by TWL for this season and one of the things they requested was a radar overview.  I made the radar overview and since leagues require sv_pure, the radar which is a custom texture does not show up.  Since the file was changed, the name was changed as well to avoid confusion.  \r\n\r\nThis map is a Source remake of the Counterstrike 1.6 map de_forge by brute of <a href=\"http://www.brutesmaps.com/\">www.brutesmaps.com</a> which was a remake of the original Counterstrike map de_cbble with the intention to make the gameplay more balanced for league play.
