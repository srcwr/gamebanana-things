	"_sText": "First map I've made in a LOOOOOONG time, so I started with a remake of a fairly simple layout which grew and evolved over the course of its creation. \r\nGenerally fast paced gameplay, but it also includes a bomb site for when things need to move along.  I also chose to drop the scattered weapons at each spawn in favor of Buy Zones. 27 spawn points per team.  Enjoy!"
