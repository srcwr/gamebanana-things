	"_sText": "This is a fun good game and, also a serious game. Its a DE, so a bomb/defuse with 2 sites ( A and B). This is my first ever uploaded map i have map and the first one for Counter-Strike Source. I have worked on this for about 4 weeks. I had, trouble making the map over view, so bare with me, its my first map. Hope you like it and enjoy. If you spot any bugs or wrong things ill be happy if you tell me, but this is a final so i wont fix it. NO map has no problems. I used some props and textures from css Valve maps just to tell you and i do not take credit for the props and textures. If you want to put it on your server or any server go ahead feel free.\r\n\r\nInstall : just download it and put it in you css cstrike map folder. Simple.\r\n"
