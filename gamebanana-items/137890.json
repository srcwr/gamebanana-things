I messaged him a while back and asked him\r\n if he would find it cool having a map made with a surf style he really \r\nlikes. Therefore the surf on this map is made in agreement with Caffrey.\r\n I really hope he likes it and you do too!<br>Check out his streams on https://www.twitch.tv/caffrey<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe name Salvation stands from a TV-Show we both really like but got \r\ndiscontinued after Season 2. A \"Noah\" type rocket named Salvation is the\r\n main focus in that Show. That's why the theme is space.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcuse the small but noticable lighting/shadows \"bugs\" on some ramps. I \r\nran into them alot and in the end decided it's not that big of a deal, I\r\n hope you can look over them :p<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! -Danger"
