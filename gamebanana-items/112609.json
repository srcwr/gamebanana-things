Thats what the weapons spread around the map are for.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n   - 2 Separate Spawn rooms both with a small amount of water for the player's safety after jumping from the Glass platform.\r\n\r\n   - All Glass on this map is breakable, so be careful when going up there for the AWPs.\r\n\r\n   - 2 Weapon rooms ( Mp5 one and an UMP45 both also having snipers)\r\n\r\n   - Water containing 4 flash and 4 explosive grenades\r\n\r\n   - Other weapons include deagle, para. m4a1 and ak47.\r\n\r\n   - Map supports 32 people.\r\n\r\n   "
