They look good and I shall be developing more detailed textures.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis map took 2 days to make.  I think that this map is a good fun map to play.  I had great fun training a member of my clan on this map.  And had loads of good fun games playing this map.  It has camping spots and close combat action places.  There is also 2 ways to the outside of the map which i will leave you to find, believe me they are difficult.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFinally this is a BETA map, i need to know of bugs, feedback and suggestions to improve this map.  In order for this I would like you to contact me either via MSN or via Email.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nHave fun playing this map :D\r\n\r\nMSN: mammoth@jamiew.info\r\nEmail: wako_hair_jay@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n212.187.209.16:27015"
