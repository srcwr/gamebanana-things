For here lurks great evil and if we do not destroy it, its overwhelming aura will soon cause the dead to walk the earth, for hell is full!\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: When killing a dozen hostages in another screw-up... we decided to stop by for a quick prayer, while we got reports of superstitious terrorists wanting to bomb this place!\r\n\r\nIn the laughable event the dead would walk the earth like they proclaim, longing to 'swallow our souls'... Come Get Some!"
