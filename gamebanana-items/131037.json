Just upload it and give it a try! You won't regret it! As you learn the map, and get better at surfing it will become more enjoyable and more fun!\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay, but I guess is better late than never! This is probably my last Ze map, as I am moving on with other projects, but I just wanted to finish this up for everyone in the community to enjoy!\r\n\r\nI might re-compile my maps for CS:GO if a zombie mod becomes available.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Eugenio 'Motanum' Roman \r\n\r\nBugs, comments, suggestions to agent_2114@hotmail.com or eugenio.motanum91@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSee screenshots\r\n\r\nInstallation, just paste the all of the files in the rar on your maps folder for counter strike source\r\nDefault should be Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\Account_Name\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n\r\nNote, ze_ApertureScience_OB got trashed because of ported models, if you want the map for your server just pm for a link to mediafire"
