This is the combined map of all 3, letting you choose 1 of 3 options for which one to play. Kind of like a multigame map.\r\n\r\nSadly, when we combined the maps some problems occured. For instance, some lighting went wrong, parts of the maps can be seen in the sky floating somewhere for some reason. A 3D skybox also didn't want to approve the moving of the maps. Tho, they work as intended.\r\n\r\nWe would of had fixed those errors, but the time was running out.\r\n\r\nLike so many other maps, it has to be played at first and not just judged by the look. It is a minigame after all.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the .BSP from just one of the maps, that can be arranged. The carchase map is not missing it's background in the standalone file.\r\n\r\nThis map is obsolete, some tree textures are missing. And I can't fix it without having fixing the skybox going crazy. One of the 3 minigames can still be removed and without being affected by the problems with this map. Just PM."
