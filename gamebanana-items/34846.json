It's a totally created from scratch and manually optimized (hand-tuned) .nav-file because in original map author's archive was included simple auto-gen.\r\n\r\nMore than 70% of all areas and paths were created manually because during an auto-generation processing the majority of them were constructed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nWell... bots (and hostages) have opportunity to use all walkable ways and they surely move on all territory of the map. Though, it is necessary to notice that the fire-escape protected with a lattice still causes in them some difficulties - sometimes they don't want to give a way to each other! :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh was fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n- For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original auto-gen navigation file in .bsp-file and available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/158072);\r\n\r\n- See also hand-tuned NAV for Bomb/Defuse version of this nice industrial-themed map by Warhawk3407 - [de_industrial_beta](http://css.gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3748).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also I'm always glad to your responses and remarks :-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Warhawk3407 (for nice designed and high detailed industrial-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nSprinkle snow with red, yeah..? ;-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 20.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Place Names are changed (replaced on more corresponding to environment);\r\n- Some other minor improvements.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
