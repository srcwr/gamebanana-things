	"_sText": "This map I started about a month or so ago, about a week after I finished my shipment remake. I wanted to make the remake as close to the real thing without using any custom content such as models or textures. I think it turned out really nice.\r\n\r\nI even added a radar overlay that is zipped into the map file iteself.\r\n\r\nThe best part is this maps file size is really small, around 7MB. I wanted to keep it small because I know that a lot of custom maps with big file sizes seem to fail more than the ones with small sizes.\r\n\r\nCustom NAV file by chizbone."
