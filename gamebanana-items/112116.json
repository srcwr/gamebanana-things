Here's the basic storyline from the map text file:\r\n\r\nAfter seeing peculiar objects falling from the sky into a seemingly empty plot of land, government agents have set up a small camp to do research on the mysterious happenings. Unknown to them, the land is already inhabited by terrorists who does not want trespassers.\r\n\r\nMore can be read in the text files that come with the map.\r\n\r\nTake note that there is a secret room in the map. And since no one is taking much notice in this map, I will post the access code to the secret room\r\n\r\nIt is 137489 \r\n\r\nInstructions on how to use the secrets are enclosed in the map texts."
