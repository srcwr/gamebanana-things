	"_sText": "My first map.  Its not much but i think it looks alright.  Theres a few secrets including an AK with a green light that follows and a c4 charge that if you hold, you hold a spear infront of you and the tip kills anything (try to make it a rule that Ts cannot team kill with it)\r\n\r\nThanks goes out to TomGreen for help on making it and providing me with some of the buildings in the map\r\n\r\nWatch out, there is (if you count the arena floor) 2 idiot traps.  Ones pretty obvious and other is the arena floor.\r\n\r\nIm currently making a version 2 of this map.  Some changes is the skybox changed to night and i added rain with sound(but i cant seem to get the rain sound to loop each round so im having trouble) lightning.  Added a few idiot traps and at a certain time Lightning hits some where so watch your step :)\r\nAnd The Secrets Are changing\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n            -KamiKazi\r\n\r\nPS If for some reason you wanna add me(cause i need ideas for future maps) steam is roit14 (and yes Roit its an inside joke)"
