This is a ground-up, from scratch reconstruction for the source engine.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-Fully modeled dinosaur skeletons including T. rex and Brachiosaurus\r\n-Both skeletons are climbable (and explode with bomb detonation)\r\n-Many more custom models and textures.\r\n-Richly detailed architecture.\r\n-Vents now give access to ceiling in T. rex room.\r\n-New, more balanced layout.\r\n-CT/T sniper windows guard primary choke point.\r\n-Actual museum exhibits.\r\n-Beta has generic nav.\r\n-40 spawn points\"\r\n\r\nTo try it offline use CoCoNUTÂ´s nav-file: http://css.gamebanana.com/tools/148"
