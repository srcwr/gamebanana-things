All I know is that we need to blow up the building in the middle, and they allowed me to bring a friend.<br><br>I have created a fully textured version of the zombie_city map that was included in the Valve repo leak. In addition to making some tuning adjustments, I have also included the vmf file for your convenience. You are welcome to use my modified version of the map however you see fit. This is my first upload to Gamebanana, so I hope you will enjoy it, perhaps even with a friend. Thank you!<br><br>"
