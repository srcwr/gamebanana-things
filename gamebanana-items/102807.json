	"_sText": "The map is basicly a room divided by a wall, separating the two teams, it as ladders (some hidden), a gate that does unnusual noises, a crazy room that i created for no reason (it has the light switch in there), a bombsite zone with barrel dynamics and buyzones.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map was created for the use of nightvision and flashlight, so if you try it you better like them.\r\n\r\nNot recommended to play with bots, since they can't press a switch and they can see in the dark."
