It'll work out though, its random enough.\r\n\r\nMy main objective with this map was just some funky darkish outdoor lighting... Looks allright but coulda been better. The geomety is kinda lazy/lacking but its a GG map so its not only expected but pretty much demanded.\r\n\r\nI put medium in the size but it is technically big for GG... didn't know what to do!.. oh well.\r\n\r\nCheck out our site & servers @ www.claneos.com if you want to be a part of my community and maybe even harass or influence me into making a map for you :P. Also for mapping help, I love helping people... or just to play of course!!! haha.\r\n\r\nAnyways, PLUR, Have fun!\r\n\r\nP.S. If you're about to leave a comment saying \"47 you sh*t out too many boxes into this map\" I agree... I was too lazy to make a whole crap load of unique things to block areas off since I don't play gg :O sorry!"
