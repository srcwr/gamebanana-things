The government has placed spy's and communication devices around the building and has just intercepted the terrorists plans. They rush a group of counter-terrorists in to stop the bombing.\r\n\r\nPro's: \r\nFast paced.\r\n2 Bombsites, one under staircase and one in the garden.\r\nMultiple ways to move and flank throughout the building such as elevetaor lift, vent, ramp, staircase, and ladders.\r\n-Great scenery, and environmental effects\r\n-Great map for teamwork and coordination.\r\n\r\nCons (maybe):\r\nFor those who like huge maps: this is slightly small.\r\nTurn your brightness up a little because some area's may be a wee bit dark because it is foggy outside.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. - Nobiscuit"
