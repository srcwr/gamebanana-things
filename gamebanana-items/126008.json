The map contains the original gravity, for speed dialing at the very beginning, after which you should not crash into the doors!<br><br>In the beginning there is a quiet song.<br><br>At the end of the card there is a small bonus of jumping 64 units.<br><br>I want to note that I did not have a map for 1 day from scratch)<br><br>I really hope that you will enjoy playing on my map!<br><br>Have a good game!<br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0OMjVkwHRs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>"
