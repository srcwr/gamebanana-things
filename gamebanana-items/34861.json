The special attention should be paid to both bombsites in a type of complexity of movements: throug a ladders and stairs (Bombsite B) and around the deadly hole (Bombsite A).\r\n\r\nWell... bots freely move through all walkable areas of the map now. I hope that new advanced style of a bot's behaviour on this nice map will give you pleasure ;-)\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original .nav-file by Snipergen included in .bsp-file and available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/30330).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks. ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Snipergen (for excellent outdoor/indoor industrial-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nLet curls a smoke on the water! :-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 22.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Accelerated bot's movements through the lattice (Underpass).\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
