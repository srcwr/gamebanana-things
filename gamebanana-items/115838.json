	"_sText": "PLEASE READ DESCRIPTION CLEARLY FIRST.\r\n<br><br>Hello, well recently i've seen that porting between valve games is allowed, and thought it would be cool to see a very very good and underrated map from day of defeat source onto counter strike source which is a much bigger played game, the map is 100% complete and working but as for weapons go, well you're going to need some sort of weapons mod for your server to run this because there are no weapons around the map or any buy zones at this stage, the players will only have a pistol and a knife without any weapons mod. Also i am unsure which category to put this map in, if placing it in the other/misc category is the wrong please leave comment on which category i should put this in, yes the file size is big, but im sorry thats how its going to have to be unless you don't mind pink/black textures. There are 64 player slots on this map so it should be suited for any server really. Any criticism will be good and taken in the correct way, same goes with any suggestions which would be nice. All credits go to valve for everything else.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Best played with deathmatch mod.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>NEW IN V2:\r\n<br>Fixed Cubemaps/HDR\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Thanks for reading."
