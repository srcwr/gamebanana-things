It's the same style as the other ones: abstract/crazy/surreal.\r\nThere are a few spots where the displacements get a bit expensive on slower computers so I don't recommend playing this map on older machines. Most computers nowadays should be able to run this flawlessly though.\r\n\r\nI'd like to thank everyone at the j2 forums for their help, support and advice and I'd like to thank them for letting me be a part of such a great mapping community.\r\n\r\nCheck out the zip's txt file for more info on the map.\r\nAlso check out the other maps in the abstract mappack!\r\n\r\nAlpha's map seperately: \r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/58218\r\n\r\nAnd the whole pack:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/58046"
