	"_sText": "This first map that I started, though it has been remade in the last few months.  The only section that hasn't really been remade is the first section.  I started it to experiment with new bhop ideas, since I was tired of the typical corridor-style levels and same box platforms over and over.  This map is intended for play with sv_airaccelerate 100.\r\n\r\nThere is a \"duel\" mini-game just in case you get tired or frustrated with bhopping and need a break.  Two players enter the red teleports and have to shoot the targets above eachother's head.  \r\n\r\nThere are a few secret items spread around.  The 'kite' gun boosts you when you press e.  When pressed right after jumping, you can get some lift and jump long distances.  There are two in the map: one on the boxes at the end and one at the end of the long jump which will only spawn after completing the map.  These guns can be respawned every 10 minutes and will kill the current gun being used.\r\n\r\nIn the longjump, a \"secret\" scout can be picked up after 255 and will respawn 5 minutes after pick up.  After 260, the anti-bhop platforms are removed.  The LJ goes to 266, though my current best is 264."
