	"_sText": "Just a small little idea I came up with:\r\n\r\nWhat happens is there's a circle of metal rods surrounding this random floating ball. If you go within the circle of rods a laser will randomly shoot from the ball to one of the rods, then one to the next in a continuous circular motion each laser coming out .25 sec after the last until every rod has a laser shooting at it then a laser will shoot out the top and after .75 more sec. lightning shoots from the ground to the ball causing it to explode and kill everyone within a certain radius.\r\n\r\n*Soon to come* After I figure out how to make the lasers rotate with the ball i will make a second version where it spins before it explodes and maybe but doubtedly even a third where it'll begin to spin and go in an upwards motion unveiling a secret room below it. \r\n\r\n*Note* The .rar contains both the .BSP and the .VMF so you may try it out without having to compile.\r\n\r\nHere's a small video since the screenshots can't really capture what it does:\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eehQcnHImq0\"> </param> <embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eehQcnHImq0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"> </embed> </object>\r\n\r\n<font size=3> Enjoy!"
