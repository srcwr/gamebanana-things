The map takes place in the wrecked streets of an unnamed city where terrorists have staged an attack to steal millions being shipped to a corporation recently beginning construction on its high security vault. Of course this corporation had no idea that shipping cold hard cash to a incomplete vault was a bad thing!\r\n\r\nHave fun with the map guys!\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nNot really a bug, but no matter what I have done, the hostages on the lower floor demand to jump out the window, so for now just be kind and shoot it out for them. Also the upper floor hostages can be a bit iffy how they get out. I'm definitely working on this for later, but the hostages will make it to the rescue point.\r\n\r\nInstall: Drag the three folders into your C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\Username\\counter-strike source\\cstrike ."
