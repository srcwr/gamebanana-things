I made this map one day after installing hammer\r\nhence some of the poor textures and skybox.\r\n\r\nPrefabs i used : \r\n\r\n1) de_dust2 door was made by valve, i have only copied this to my map\r\n2) guardpost was downloaded from fps banana but has been modified for this map by me (Dalphia)\r\n3) weapon dispensers were also from fps banana\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, if you want to use any original ideas from this map (including layout) please email me \"nanomanxxx@hotmail.com\" and also\r\nplease recognise  work that was developed by me.\r\n\r\nHave fun \r\n\r\nOh, almost forgot, Please post all constructive feedback to me on fps banana (username = dalphia) or at my email address (nanomanxxx@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nCheers and enjoy !!\r\n\r\nDalphia\r\n\r\nOnce again, i only want feedback that will make me a better mapper, no \"this sucks\" alright. Only constructive feedback :D"
