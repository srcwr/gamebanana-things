It's a completely created from scratch and fully manual optimized .nav-file (because in original mapauthor's release was included simple auto-gen).\r\n\r\nThis Navigation Mesh almost completely was hand-made because in auto-gen nav some waypaths were laid incorrectly and some areas were missed (in particular - almost all top levels including exits to roofs).\r\n\r\nNow bots use all possible ways... and now gameplay on this twisted map turn into the true madness, no doubt! :D\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/161686).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also send your responses and remarks ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Redbodega (for this crazy twisted and coastal atmospheric industrial-themed map, also for his other excellent maps).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nLong Live Greatest Maps! :-)"
