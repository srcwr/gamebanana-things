This is a texture map. Use the height and cover to your advantage.\r\nI made this map to a design from a friend (radical). This is his second design and was really fun to play.\r\n\r\n<b>Objective:</b>\r\nUse the objects and environment to beat your enemies in gunfights. Pure skill will save you from getting that one headshot you didn't deserve.\r\n</center>"
