There is no 3 though because version 3 was weird but people downloaded it so I have to name this v4.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's new?\r\n==================\r\n\r\nWell to start off have I greatly increased the look of it.\r\n\r\n- Improved spawn, and made it look more nice\r\n\r\n- Added more details and decals\r\n\r\n- Changed lightning to a more friendlier lightning\r\n\r\n- Changed almost every texture\r\n\r\n- Changed Skybox to militia_hdr instead of Galaxy\r\n\r\n- Fixed the ending level and made it look better.\r\n\r\n- Fixed so its random on level 3 (Big thank to Ghost who fixed it).\r\n\r\n- Added a secret in level 4 behind the boxes. (Jump on the lamp to get to it)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is probaply my last release. Of course if somethings wrong do I reupload in another version name so it's really important that you report bugs and things that not  how it's supposed to be!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease, give me feedback on my new map and rate and comment.
