	"_sText": "Hi all,<br><br>It has been a while since I have uploaded anything, so I decided to upload a jailbreak map that I made over 4 years ago. It was exclusively on the Dying 2 Kill CS:S jailbreak server, but that has since closed down, so I thought I would release the map for those that still play.<br><br>The map features 17 minigames of varying types, including:<br><ul><li>Hide N Seek (requires Source mod plugin for thirdperson)</li><li>Hunger games</li><li>RNG cannon</li><li>Hangman</li><li>Zombie rush</li><li>Skipping</li><li>Zombie snipers</li><li>Obstacle course</li><li>Climb</li><li>Nade wars</li><li>Knock knock</li><li>A few more</li><li>Furniture game</li></ul><br>The map also has many creative play areas and tools.<br><br>There are 2 RNG encounters while walking down 2 of the coridoors. One will spawn zombies from each side, which need to be killed or they will kill you. The other will break the floor, revealing a small obstacle course in order to get through.<br><br>Much time was spent developing this map, so I hope you all enjoy it. There may be a few broken things, so if that is the case, let me know."
