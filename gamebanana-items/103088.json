While all the vegetarians are happy, much of the population continues to purchase contraband meat at high prices.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-TERRORISTS: Recently our intelligence has discovered a meat distribution plant in our country. The criminals operating it are expecting us and will try to cover up the evidence by planting a C4 explosive either by the meat storage room, or in their office building. Stop them!\r\n\r\nTERRORISTS: The government has sent a militia force to stop us from feeding our country. But they will not have enough evidence against us if we destroy the meat in the storage or the money from the sales in the office. Plant a C4 at one of the sites and make sure that the charge goes off!\r\n\r\nLevel design: Die0 and Aleksandr\r\nTextures: die0 and nay0r\r\nSkybox: Hipsh0t\r\nNav file: Barnd00r\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to the MH clan and all DS testers."
