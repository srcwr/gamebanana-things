I made this map in about 4 days off and on. I put around 30 hours of work into this map.\r\n\r\n   Three of the five pyramids you can climb all over on. The other two you can actually go INSIDE and UP for a great sniping spot!\r\n\r\n   This map was a lot of fun to make but at the same time very tedious. As usual, I began to obsess about finishing it and so I couldn't stop working on it.\r\n\r\n   I didn't get to make the ground have displacements. I didn't really want it to, though. I also didn't add scenery to the 3d skybox but why bother? This map is already great and already a large enough file size.\r\n\r\n  Playtests indicate the map is a blast. Framerates are very good, too. All in all it's an awesome map whether you are playing 1v1 or 20v20. This map also accomodates low-gravity very nicely!\r\n\r\nENJOY !!!\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremy \"Air\" Hurley\r\nhurley@cox.net\r\nbasicair1 on AIM"
