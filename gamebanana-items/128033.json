	"_sText": "This map was made by me and oobis a while back. I just now decided to share it openly. I is a minigame in which the Terrorists spawn in these shooting range areas with a window that can only be seen from their side. They can have either type of sniper rifle. They CT spawn with no weps and must run to the end without getting killed. Once reaching the end they can pick up grenades in which to throw inside the slots of the Terrorist boxes and blow them up. The glass in which the CT can see T on the top is only one sided. So the T has no idea where you are. The map features a helicopter noise in the beginning and has lighting effect. The secret room includes a lobby with a trail grenade, couches, ipads, music booth, and hot tub. The other room includes a Disco room that has a DJ booth, a bar, and a dance floor. There is a secret music button in this map somewhere. Where is it and what is it? You'll just have to find it yourself. This took some good time of work even though some of you out there can probably do way better than me. But hey, I'm new to mapping ok? Enjoy as much as you want\r\n\r\nNote: Most fun with 8+ people\r\n\r\nTodo List: v2 including grenade fix in which you can get more grenades without having to be far away from it first and glitching."
