	"_sText": "de_relic is a competitive map designed to echo the balance and vantage points (such as the sniping point from t spawn to outside ct spawn on dust2) found in classic 1.6 maps like de_dust2 and de_aztec.\r\n\r\nde_relic pushes the balance aspect of css as far as it can go by allowing an extreme amount of teamwork, quick play and variety every round.\r\n\r\nRelic is designed to emulate classic Counter-Strike gameplay.  The gameplay that influenced the the gaming scene entirely, changing it forever.  Before mic spammers, hackers and internet tough guys were plaguing the CS community, everybody was just in it for the fun.  Relic is here to bring that back.\r\n\r\nI can guarantee relic is three things.  Fun, fast, and competitive.  Please enjoy responsibly.\r\n\r\nNote: This version of de_relic is an alpha version, due to the fact that a few graphical adjustments must be made."
