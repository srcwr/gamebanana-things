	"_sText": "A small surf map, which contains only one surf ledge?\r\n\r\nWhen you go through the middle building, you receive a large speed boost, use your skills to repeat this and get to the top of the ramp, always travel on the right hand side for the boost, and discover the secrets of this compact map.\r\n\r\nYou begin with just a knife but weapons are easily obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this map is to reach the super-top, and receive and AWP for you're efforts (packed with full ammo).\r\n\r\nGetting to normal top will grant you a grenade, and getting to the main room (below top) will give you 3 m4a1's or 3 ak47s.\r\n\r\nLanding on the side of the middle building (which has jail in the centre) gives you an m3 shotgun, useful for killing opponents on the surf ramps or in the air!\r\n\r\nSecret weapons in this map include: mp5's, glocks, flashbangs and smoke grenades\r\n\r\nI will not reveal any secrets of this map, thats up to you to find out!\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and if you find any glitches/bugs please comment here. Thanks\r\n\r\nPS. i know the water is invisible, i couldn't get it to work!\r\n\r\n"
