The map was created with 32 spawn points, but only to keep it so players won't be stuck in spectator mode.\r\n\r\nThe skybox was a poor last-minute hack job.  Anyone who knows anything about mapping should see that the palm trees are horribly off-scale.  The FPS for the map should be pretty decent, however.  And the map is fairly symmetrical, so neither team should have issues dealing with disadvantages.\r\n\r\n- E\r\n\r\nhttp://mandos.us"
