It is on the larger side for a gungame map and provides both close-quarter indoors fighting and wide-open spaces outdoors.\r\nThere are also several high (really high) snipering spots and some hunker-down camping spots too (such as the texture car parking lot).\r\n\r\nWatch your step on the spires - the fall won't kill you but the landing will.\r\n\r\n~~~Worm\r\n"
