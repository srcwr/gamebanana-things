I fallowed the same lay-out guidelines but added more realistic detail that resembles a bombed out set of houses.  I didn't want to add to much detail that it would strey away from the gameplay of the original map design.  \r\n\r\nNote: The red wooden house has some invisible bullet proof textures guarding the player from bullets shot through the walls.  Also every player will spawn with a deagle instead of USP/Glock.  Buyzones are still included at spawn.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to: |CMD| clan for hosting and inspiring this map.  Also, thanks to Axzer for inspiring a fun proven layout.  My only hopes is this map is as fun as aim_furious."
