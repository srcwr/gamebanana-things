This version has smaller panes of glass that are easier to damage, and a higher wall at the top to prevent so many grenades from landing on your face!\r\nDarker lighting with red lighting in the bomb area.\r\nv3.0 - initial release\r\nv3.1 - added big drop at bottom\r\nv3.2 - added bombsite decal\r\nv3.3 - scrapped\r\nv3.4 - complete redesign, back to 10 floor original, better lighting, cubemaps working, performance enhancements, bugfixes, no bombsite decal\r\nv3.5 - fixed bomb from falling down the pit of doom\r\nv3.6 - the bomb still seems to fall through when travelling at high speed - got rid of the pit of doom and added a tunnel of doom instead\r\nv3.7 - introduction of a new void underneath a reworked lower deck\r\nv3.8 - performance improvements, cubemaps (sorry this increases the filesize by 4MB) apparently working"
