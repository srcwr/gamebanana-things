I tried to make it look as much like the RF version, except for the walls, the RF version didnâ€™t have walls. You can snipe across the valley at the other team and hide in the bunker or you can try to run across and shoot them, its harder though with enemy snipers watching you.\r\n\r\nHope ya'll like it.\r\n"
