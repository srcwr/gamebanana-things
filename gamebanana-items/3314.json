Make sure to edit it, so none is going to be annoyed because of the fact you copied it.\n\n**Read this:**\nThe button below will randomize the ladder that will bring you to the next level, make sure to push this on the begin of the round. Otherwise all the ladders will give -35 Damage.\n\nAbove the map there are 4 scouts with 10 bullets, next to the scouts there is a teleport which teleports you back down."
