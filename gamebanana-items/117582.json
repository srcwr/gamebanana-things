This is the BETA version***\r\n\r\nThis map was created by Richard Crehan and inspired by Konami's Playstation 1 Title \"Metal Gear Solid\".\r\n\r\nI am releasing a BETA version of this map to get feedback from my peers in hopes to have a highly enjoyable finished product. I have been working on this for about a week and a half* and hope to have it finsihed within less than a month. I appreciate all feedback and downloads. Thank you for taking your time downlaoding and adding your input. I want to make this map as fun and accurate as possible. This is my first map and I am interested in fidning a partner to work with to reach my goal of brining a piece of Metal Gear Solid to Counter-Strike: Source. Thank you for reading.\r\n\r\n*This was written on September 3rd."
