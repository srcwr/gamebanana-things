Fixed a skip where there was an invisible booster. I had one there originally but then never removed it properly. Thanks to Kris for pointing these out for me."

I was shooting for the map to be around 1:15 to 1:30 but it'll probably be closer to a 1 minute map. There is also a fairly basic bonus that should be around 10-15 seconds.&nbsp;<br>Steam:&nbsp;https://steamcommunity.com/id/Valetorious/<br><br>If anybody wants to port to CSGO, feel free to. I would probably take this time to learn how to do it, but I'm away from home and using my wife's laptop which can't run CSGO. Bhop_astra still needs to be ported as well if anybody is interested in that.<br><br>"
