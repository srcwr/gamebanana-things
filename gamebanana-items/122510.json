I've been informed that it is like surf_skyworld in a way, and people seem to like it.\r\n\r\nIt was a quick build and I built it mainly for nooby surfers.  :)  Anyway, that being completely irrelevant, you \"pro's\" out there will have a lot of fun with this map because there are a lot of things you can mess around with and do.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
