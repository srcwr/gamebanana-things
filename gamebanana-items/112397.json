The map contains a detailed cybercafe \r\nwith breakable computers and file cabinets to save \r\nyour head! The middle of the map contains the \r\ntraditional \"quad area\" but in high graphical detail. \r\nI spent time on this map to ensure it was done right! \r\nThe map supports 32 players yet 16 recommended for \r\nperformance. Most of all have fun! "
