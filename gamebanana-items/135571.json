With doing so I got the idea to recreate the map for Counter-Strike:Source in hammer so around 2AM I started working until 5AM until the recreation of that lego scene I made as a kid was done and voila that creation is this release!\r\n\r\nThat's the little backstory to this map and well I hope you like my creation that I made as a kid!"
