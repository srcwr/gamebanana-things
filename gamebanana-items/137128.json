	"_sText": "Gungame map, with buyzone included.\r\n\r\nOn the spawn zone there is a higher zone that serves as sniping spot for the other team spawn zone and for the stairs of the enemy side. Then we have a central tower that can be reached by some stairs right next to the spawn zone, this stairs include protection to enemies coming from the side paths. It's possible to acess the tower by a central ladder. This tower provides a overview of the enemy entrance to the center of the map, so it's quite good for the team that's holding it. The side paths and the center, where the ladders are located are tight spots, allowing players to humiliate others very easly. The map is completly versatile as you can get on top of every wall and lamps there is. This is a perfect map for intense Deathmach gungame.\r\n\r\nNote that this was my first map, it came out better than I expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Update reasons:**\r\nBug fixes, player clip added and other minor improvements."
