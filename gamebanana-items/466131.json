I have spent close to 200 hours on<br>it and managed to make the BSP file size fairly small considering the<br>reasonably high detail. I have also optimised it as best as I can to<br>ensure that there are no significant FPS drops when entering new stages.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, the map focuses on variation. There are numerous routes <br>you can take, in addition to dozens of areas where you can save time,<br>and even some intentional skips to reward players who successfully maintain high<br>speed during their run. <br><br>In addition to this, I have tried my hardest to make this map enjoyable<br>for both beginners and advanced bhoppers alike. While the optimal route<br>is obviously intended for the better players, if you fail certain<br>stages which are designed for high-speed, you will be reset and given a<br>reasonable amount of velocity. This is done so that casual players who<br>fail during specific stages can still play through each stage without<br>having to pre-speed constantly."
