	"_sText": "Hello fpsbanana and thanks for checking out my map!\r\nI havn't been too active on fpsbanana lately, mostly because of school and some other things, but I hope I can get more active in the future!\r\n\r\nAbout the map, well it is an old map that I started working on about 1 year ago since I thought It would be cool to do a subway for some reason. I never planned to release it, but since it turned out pretty good I decided that there maybe was someone out there who would like it!\r\nHowever since I never planned on releasing it I never made the layout of the map \"optimizable\" so I spent some time trying to figure out how I could make it more fps-friendly. \r\n\r\nI consider the map complete now, I have even had 3 betas here on fpsbanana for feedback about the gameplay. I did however not get that much feedback on the gameplay so I am not sure how it is yet, since I havnt been able to test it with zombiemod myself. I dont really have any more time to spend on this map, so it would be nice of you to tell me what the gameplay is like asap.\r\n\r\nThe map is complete with Cubemaps, Playerclips, Soundscapes and all that good stuff, theres even 64 spawns in it. I have also added a radar overview as you asked for in the betas.\r\nThis map also features Color Correction, so make sure you have it enabled in your video options since it makes the map look over 9000 times better!\r\n\r\nAs I said, I can make minor changes to the map, but tell me as soon as possible since I dont really wanna spend more time on it hehe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a link to my steam-profile as you requested ;) \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992346412\r\n"
