	"_sText": "My first map, so don't judge too harshly. Pretty basic: there's a pyramid (obviously lol) with an awp on top, two towers (one on each side) each with two M249's. AK's and SG552's at T spawn, and M4's and AUG's at CT spawn. The hall inside the pyrimid is good for closer combat, and is also where i was experimenting with lighting."
