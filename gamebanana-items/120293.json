Already spent alot of time on this site and I enjoyed most of the stuff here.\r\n\r\nAbout this map:\r\n\r\nI made this map by myself, got the idea from other BreakBox maps and I feeled like making one myself;\r\n\r\nThe box in the middle of the map spawns HeGrenades when damaged and will eventually break apart.\r\nIn the middle of the water lies a fully ammo'ed up p228 for the one that likes to dive.\r\nOnce you fall into the water u can't return all the way to the top anymore but you Can climb up two 'hiding' spots.\r\nThe rest is pretty straightforward i guess. \r\nO ye, the map is bot proof! It's actually fun to play with bots in this one:)\r\n\r\nThat was it, I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nCya; Uvall94 - LvD"
