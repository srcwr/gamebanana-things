	"_sText": "This is a fight yard map but with a little twist, all the weapons are inside the mansion. So the first ones to run into the mansion and grab the best weapons will get an great advantage but then a greater achievement for the team with the less good weapons to kill the other team. In the attic there is small openings to throw grenades out from which leads right to the teams spawns and there is strategaly placed grenades there for those nade throwers hiding in the attic. And you can actually just chill like Bob if you want and don't worry, Bob left the tele on for you."
