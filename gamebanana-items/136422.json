	"_sText": "Well this is a map that has changed in each compile. It started off clean and simple. Then it went stormy wet and less sandy. But I then changed it back to sandy but this time made it into a bit of a sandstorm. Well only a bit but it doesn't really need to look like the real thing. :D\r\n\r\nWorse computers could struggle because of the HDR, colorcorrection and the fog. But if you have a new good computer you should be fine on it.\r\n\r\nThis took me alot of time to work on the brushwork and fix all the errors I have came across. But it is finally made.\r\n\r\nI hope for some constructive 'critic' feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks, drimp.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If need be I will make a v2.\r\n\r\nThanks KarateKaefer for the skybox."
