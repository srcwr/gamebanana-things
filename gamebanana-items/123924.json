	"_sText": "The reason i put \"unknown\" for authors is because i dont know who made the original rc or rats. Pm me if your the one who did though. Pizzathehut added some extra tunnels/opening/vents. Its really good. I just made it look much better then the original rc. There are 3 custom textures that will come with the map of course. The reason i wanted to make rc look better is because i see a lot of rats server use rc instead of de_rats because de_rats is really laggy and terrorist sided. People say \"rc's a good map, of course its not as nice looking as de_rats.\" So i decided to make it look nearly just as good as de_rats but its still the same rc experience. Hope you enjoy. Post a comment if some of the textures dont show up when you run the map or put it on your server. Thanks! Happy gamming!"
