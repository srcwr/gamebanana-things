	"_sText": "Sorry for the slight map spam. I decided to edit a good part of the map bhop_helvete2 that I made around 2 months ago back in November. I felt like the map was poorly made and that I should of never released the original map. My main gripe was how the last stage looked. It was cringeworthy seeing people play it simply because of that one stage. So I ended up putting a decent bit of work into this and fixing it up. I also added a new stage so that the map felt slightly different to play if you've already played it. Also, most skips are still possible. I decided to re-release this as another map and not update the original bhop_helvete2 upload, due to the fact that the changes I made were important.
