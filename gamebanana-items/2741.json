If you have idea how to fix this problem pleas tel me.\r\n\r\nthis brush work i made from a picture off C&C F22 plane. I workd and test meny time, thanks to Ares help me test this on his new map =)\r\n\r\nI use my friends PureIce old Camera setting from his X-wing and change them a bit.\r\n\r\n* The trigger func_viscluster in the sky is only for large open area where visibility calculations would otherwise take a very, very long time to complete.\r\n\r\n* Wen i fly and shoot i have fps in 130 and not driving 70 so 130-70= 60fps/in is used for every plane. If you want have 20 plane then 20*60+70= 1270 fps/in Total in map if all vehicle used the same time. But i think it will be more when play online the fps/in will be 2000. and this will lagg. So to fix the lag ad 14 plane and ad env_fog_controller and change (fog enabel) and  Far Z Clip Plane (5000 ore 6000). Dont ad to much prop_physics model and func_tracktrain.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n*** Very important ***\r\n\r\nI have found a problem. When enter my plane player teleport to a box outside the map then the explosion smoke not working when shoot. But when i teleport player in box in the same map then the explosion smoke works. idk if this is a bug, but its crazy i dont anderstand this. So if want see the smoke when shoot telport player in box the same map as plane. \r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n[3d models 1...](http://www.3dcadbrowser.com/browse.aspx?category=76 \"3d model\")\r\n\r\n[3d models 2...](http://www.the3dstudio.com/product_details.aspx?id_product=435124 \"3d models 2\")\r\n\r\n[3d models 3...](http://www.digitalanimators.com/HTM/Resources/3dModels/3dModelsMain.htm \"3d model 3\")\r\n\r\n* If you use my plane in your map please tel me, i want play to =)\r\n* This is my map [mg_aircraftcarrier_v1...](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/157029 \"map\")\r\nhave fun =)"
