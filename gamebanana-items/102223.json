But the town part really didn't get incorporated enough...\r\n\r\nFor some reason alot of people liked this map 2nd most of all my maps... It's small and there's plenty of places to go.\r\n\r\nThis is the Thursday, 6 October 2005 version, And I will not be updating it anymore, So if your version is older, Replace it with this."
