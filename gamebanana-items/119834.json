	"_sText": "This is my first map of any sort, although it's the third release. Brushwork is fairly simple, as would be expected in a jail. My next map will have more detailed brushwork. \r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n The four-square/four-corners game is simple to use -- just push the button on top. It randomly selects a square and kills whoever is inside it. \r\n\r\n The glass hallway is a chicken fight arena. To win, one player must jump on top of (and off of) another player's head. The loser should be killed automatically.\r\n\r\n There is a teleporter which will teleport you randomly to one of sixteen possible destinations. Some are great, others just might kill you...\r\n\r\n Weapons spawn randomly in the cells. One of the cells on the first floor gets a fiveseven, second floor a glock, and third floor a hegrenade. \r\n\r\n The loser of the race is killed automatically along with whoever else is in the loser's side, so take caution.\r\n\r\n Cells open automatically after 30 seconds and cannot be closed. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated version to 3.0a after discovering that the spray contest wall didn't accept sprays. Thanks, XFG."
