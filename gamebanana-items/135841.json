	"_sText": "GG_MONUMENT (VERSION 1)\r\n\r\nTo install, extract to:\r\n\r\nsteam\\steamapps\\username\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nIncluded are the map (gg_monumentv1.bsp) and a nav mesh for bots (gg_monumentv1.nav).  Nav mesh isn't very good, but it's functional. (They like to get stuck on a couple of things, I didn't put much effort into it.)\r\n\r\nThis map is intended for Gun Game or Deathmatch. It isn't large, but I may expand it in the future. Version 2 will include a nice 3D skybox and possibly some underground passages."
