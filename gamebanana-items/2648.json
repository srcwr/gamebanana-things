	"_sText": "This is the original Huey prefab from zombie_boatescape2. It's been over 3 years since I made this, and seeing as I haven't used it that much, I'm finally handing it out to you. A lot of people have stolen this prefab and used it in their maps without crediting me. I figure it's better to let everyone use it with permission, so that all the decent people get to utilize my hard work as well. It's completely made from brushes and doesn't have any invalid solid structures. If I recall correctly, it took about 20 hours.\r\n\r\nIF YOU USE, PLEASE CREDIT ME AS \"AURORA\", as I am no longer using the nickname \"JJ45\"."
