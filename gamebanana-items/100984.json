	"_sText": "This is still a work in progress but Very playable. \r\n\r\n This map is trying to give the player the feel that he or she is in an alien complex.  It supports up to 44 people.  It also has close, medium and far ranges for all types of weapon play.  The sound  just adds to the effect of being in an disturbed area...  Theres a decent amount of I candy through out the map and you can Interact with the map with explosive and gas propelled canisters.  Feel free to jump into the stasis field while defend bomb site b, believe me its a trip.  (lay of the dope when you play this map)\r\n\r\n Any server hosts willing to try it out and post feed back would rock.   Anything worth adding to the map, Honestly...I will add no problem.  For people with Alpha impared monitors (crapy brightness like LCD monitor owners)  Please forgive how dark it is and just increase the brightness settings.  \r\n\r\nLEVEL DESIGNERS: \r\n\r\n If you would like to work on this project with me I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT.  Any help to make this better would be well recieved.  If any mappers out there like the concept but feel as though they could piece this map together better than me...GOOD, let me know and I will send you the .vmf and be happy about it.\r\n\r\nThanks to interlopers.net for the support and knowledge on mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nD|cE of the FuK clan\r\n"
