	"_sText": "This map is a modification of the original GoldSrc 2Fort from Team Fortress Classic, retextured and modified for gun game. It is only the bridge and the 2 forts.\r\n\r\nDue to my converting the GoldSrc version of the map to a Source-compatible .vmf there are quite a few small leaks in some of the brushes, a lot I have fixed. Nothing bad and not too noticeable unless you look for them. I will try to fix some of these in future updates.\r\n\r\nUpdate Notes:\r\n\r\nV2.0:\r\n- Added small amount of water at the bottom of the pit to avoid fall damage.\r\n- Made a part of the bridge breakable.\r\n- Added a secret room.\r\n- Fixed some leaks (My benefit, to optimize future compile time).\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n- Make the break in the bridge more realistic.\r\n- Fix most of the leaks."
