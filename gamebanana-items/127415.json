	"_sText": "[**VERSION 2**](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/162469 \"http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/162469\")\r\n\r\nEnjoy a new deathrun map. It takes place in a classroom where the CT's spawn. They proceed through some dangerous traps on the hallways and next on the courtyard. The map has nice textures with good lightning.\r\n\r\nThe map contains of 30 CT spawns and 2 T spawns, 3 secret grenade spots and around 17 traps without breaking floors...\r\n\r\nAt the end, you can pick Bunny hop and Easy. Didn't make \"knife\" since you can have a knife fight on easy if wanted.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the \"final\" version since I have found no bugs on the map. If there are any found, I intend to make V2. If there is anything wrong with the download or anything else, please do not flag but rather comment. :)\r\n\r\nTo install the map, simply put the cstrike folder contained in the download over the old one in you counter strike folder.\r\n\r\nCommenting and rating is more then welcome! Enjoy! :D"
