But the textures were ugly and there were no lighting. \r\n\r\nSo I put new textrues into the map and lighting. \r\n\r\nThe following weapons are in the map: deagle, m4, ak, para, m3, tmp, p90 and scout. Also there is one galil and one Famas.\r\n\r\nthere are no buyzones included, nobody has kevlar.\r\n\r\nThis map is a lot of Fun, you have to try it!\r\nFeel free to download :)\r\n\r\n\r\ngru√ü \r\nschmiti"
