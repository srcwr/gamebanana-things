Break into the \r\ncompound and get those hostages out alive.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Maybe this time they'll listen.\r\nMany years of hard work have gone into\r\nseeing the République Française buckle\r\nunder our iron grip. Protect our 'assets'\r\nat all costs, or our demands may be left\r\nto rust in the rain.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OSq_NnPNnTQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
