	"_sText": "A map i started working on about 4-5 days ago, basically made the entire thing then did some play testing with a couple friends before i added triggers/playerclips to see what they thought, they liked the game play so i added some triggers, clips and improvements based on feedback. As well as some small detailing, was mostly square shaped rooms to begin with.&nbsp;<br><br>Then Nairda was nice enough to let me playtest the map on the Ultima WL server, so a huge thanks to him and everyone who play tested it with me and gave feedback.<br><br>I aimed for this map to be a bit longer than the maps i usually make, kind of like rgbglow but rgbglow had a lot of annoying parts which made running it kinda meh, this map however features quite a lot of boosters and possible 'spins' so if youre not a big fan of those it might not be your favorite to run at max speed (only rly an issue if ure going for the most optimal run, but i have tweaked the parts multiple times to make it easier and not as frustrating)<br><br>If its too much please let me know for my next map so i know what to change, im always looking to improve at map making (funny how i say this yet i keep making glow maps xd, maybe one day ill make something more creative)&nbsp;"
