There is a unique tunnel system throughout the letters.\r\n\r\nIt all started with a sketch, in which i mapped out the tunnels.\r\n\r\n<b>It has dynamic lighting!</b>\r\n\r\n<center><font color=\"lightgreen\" size=\"4\">Tips and Tricks</font></center>\r\n-A Key aspect of survival in this map is getting into the tunnel system quick, you'll have more cover from snipers, but are screwed from nades.\r\n\r\n-Try to take cover in the letters, in specific the A and B's, they have little rooms you can take cover in.\r\n\r\n-There are little pillars in the entrance/exits of some exits, use them from cover.\r\n\r\n-If you're a sniper, stay at spawn, or a letter near the spawn, you have more cover and have a chance to run back to spawn if needed."
