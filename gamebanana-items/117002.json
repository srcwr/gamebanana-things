CAL was derived from the school we go to Cal U of PA. \r\n\r\nBigJR asked me to make a simple Deathmatch map that he drew up. I had never used Hammer before and it was a lot of fun learning how to create calfun_deathmatch.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th and final version of the map.\r\n\r\nThis was our most played map on our server.\r\n\r\nI miss having the server but hopefully some people will get to enjoy the maps I made for it for a long time."
