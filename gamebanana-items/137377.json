	"_sText": "I actually put some work into this, so don't let the empty screenshots deter you.\r\n\r\nFast paced gameplay, but also suitable for quick deathmatch rounds. Optimized to just 1.6MB size for quickest possible download.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't play this in gg mode, the map reveals its full potential. You have to get behind cover and either get smoke grenades to cover your way to the m4 in the middle or run back to the gate in your spawn area and grab an mp5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to all supporters. If you add any of my maps to your rotation, please let me know so I can check by and gather feedback.\r\n\r\nMore projects at <a href=\"http://www.acidmaps.net\">acidmaps.net</a>"
