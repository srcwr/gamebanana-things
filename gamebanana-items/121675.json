And to Puss'N'Boots, for helping me test it.\r\n\r\nIf you are wanting to create a new version of this map, please add me to your xfire, and have some maps present that you have done to show me you are worthy! :D\r\n\r\nI was thinking that there weren't any surf maps made solely for the use of awps. So I made one. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-Toxic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract to C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps"
