Version 4 (Updated 4/8/10)\r\n--\r\nAs time goes by, the concentric rings of this map turn into damage zones.\r\nThey make sure players move towards the center - OR THEY DIE.\r\nIn about 80 seconds, the only safe place to stand will be the inner region of this map.\r\nOn the roof of the arena there is also an indicator showing the status of the arena floor and each ring.  The first player off the spawn shelf starts the clock.\r\nEven the spawn shelf won't hang around forever - so don't just stand there - move it!\r\n"
