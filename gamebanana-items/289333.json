Cramped as hell because I mistakenly made it that way and didn't even realize how bad it would be until I actually playtested it. Very nice if you like using the M3. Not so nice if you like being able to actually move. Will probably remake when I learn more of how Hammer works and get used to it.<br><br>version 2 actually adds new hallways so you don't have to go through the central hallway and get stuck behind your team and infront of the opposing side."
