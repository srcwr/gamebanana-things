This is a completely finished layout of the map, which means there is only aesthetics to add in.\r\n\r\nIt is a hostage rescue map, with four hostages needing rescue. The rescue zone is a snack store located by the Counter-Terrorist spawn zone. Just let the train tracks act as your North Star as you find your way back.\r\n\r\nThere is a Counter-Terrorist block of buildings nested under train tracks, a small shantyville shielded underneath wooded roofing, and a red building infested with Terrorists. There are 3 alleyways to get from one side to the other, with a few entryways to each.\r\n\r\nThe skybox is absolute garbage right now, and its only placeholder. As well as the lighting."
