The other day I saw that RpK (One of the VERYGAMES team players) has been using this map to practise. Since the map seems to be a success I decided to release training_aim2 adding some interesting features like moving targets and detailed instructions about the use of the control panel.</font>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"+\"; color=\"red\"><font size=\"+3\">IMPORTANT:</font> since source engine is not perfect try to shoot ahead of dynamic targets. Sometimes you hit them and nothing happens, it's like a ghost target were a little advanced from the original one. Try to shoot at that \"ghost target\" ;).</font>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"+\"; color=\"blue\">Features</font></legend>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> You have an absolute control of the targets and their properties with the control panel.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> There is an instructions button that will show up full instructions about the use of the control panel. People with low textures setting will not be able to read properly.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> You can choose any weapon from CS:S.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> Hits Counter that counts how much targets did you shoot.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> A beep sounds when you get to shoot at a target.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> You can control how much targets to spawn in a row before stopping (25/50/100/999).<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> Different distances from the wall (levels).<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> Start and Stop button in each level.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> 252 Different targets all over the wall (200 static, 52 dynamic).<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> Unlimited ammo with all the weapons. That means you don't need to reload so you can concentrate on shooting targets..<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> It has a good environment to prevent headaches (xD).<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> Custom textures for the buttons.<br>\r\n<font color=\"orange\">>></font> GOD mode on some properties for those who think that the map is too easy ;) (I personally think it is imposible).</fieldset><br>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"+2\"; color=\"yellow\">How to use:</font><font size=\"+\"> Open CS:S, create a server and select training_aim2 in the maps list (don't allow bots). Join a team, choose a weapon, set your configuration and go the level you want. Then click start button and wait 2 seconds for the first target to appear, you can practise moving left and right or being stand in a position.</font>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"+2\"; color=\"green\">Special Thanks to [www.Unn-GameS.com](http://www.Unn-GameS.com \"www.Unn-GameS.com\")</font>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"+5\"; color=\"yellow\">If you liked it please Rate and Comment =)</font>"
