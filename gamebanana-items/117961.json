There will be the vs_hideout and the vs_hideout_4.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that vs_hideout_4 can have up to 4 players and no hdr while vs_hideout can have only 2 players and has hdr with built cubemaps. \r\n\r\nHopefully you and your freind(s) will have a bit of fun with this map as it is small. \r\n\r\nAll maps feature an light environment and vegetation.
