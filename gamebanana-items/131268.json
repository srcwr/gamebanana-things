	"_sText": "This Map was under Construction a few years back. As XPGaming servers dwindled. So did our teams  hope for this map. I am now releasing this map which fully works for public testing. When this map was being created, over a half of year of developing was put into it by 3 authors and a texture developer\r\nEvilhomer\r\nInstant Death\r\n]ES[ Church Xx ]GaD[\r\n\r\nEvilwaffle\r\n\r\nthis map has 64 player spawns several different levels for zombies and humans to roam around\r\n\r\nA City, A Dungeon, An underground, a desert, the Arctic, and a lush jungle. \r\n\r\nOriginally The map was over 47 MB with Custom content and content from portal. Most of this content was removed to limit filesize.\r\n\r\nWhen the players choose a level, All other levels seal off and players who are trapped are teleported back to the spawn. The Mayhem begins.\r\n\r\nEveryone please enjoy.\r\n64 player spawns\r\nAnyone feel free to download and change this map around but give credit to the original authors\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\nEDIT*** Custom Portal Props removed (2 were left in)\r\n\r\nAll Custom textures were remade by Evilwaffle using several pictures of portal"
