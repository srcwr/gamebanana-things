	"_sText": "This is a enlarged/carved/manipulated version of my first map, the first map was very fun in game, but it got hectic when the server was at max. The larger spawn areas and new paths help this, but as in the other one, you are going to come into contact with the enemy fairly quickly.\r\n\r\nFullbright is enabled for my own sake, a geforce mx4 isnt exactly the greatest video card and to achieve good fps (>30) thus i need a simple map with no lighting effects. comments/suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nMidWest | GunGame\r\n69.12.92.157:27015\r\n\r\n Enjoy!"
