Thank you for playing my map. You may need to generate your own nav for bot support.<br><br><b><u>WARNING:</u></b><br>Just to make sure, but this map was not made to support or mock anything relating to current events. This was just made because I didn't want to make another city map. If you actually think that, then you are a goddamn retard."
