I'm quite pleased with the results, and I hope you will be too.\r\n\r\nThe map takes place in an abandonded, underground train tunnel depot, with 2 sets of tracks and a platform with a bombzone in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe map includes:\r\n-Ventilation Shafts\r\n-Bombzone in the center of the map\r\n-38 Spawn Points in total\r\n-Teams starting in opposite corners of the map\r\n\r\nThe map is great for both sniping, using shotguns, and regular weapons, since there are many different places with different ranges.\r\n\r\nPlease, if you try this map, post a review, telling me what you liked or how I can improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n / CrucixTM\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Do NOT decompile, edit or claim to be the owner of this map.
