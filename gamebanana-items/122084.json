	"_sText": "This is the final version of this map. After alot of testing, this map has become good enough for release. I know the textures could be better, but i thought that for now the surf is the most important. There may come new versions with better textures and more surf. The spawn part may look like surf_greatriver, but the rest is made from own ideas."
