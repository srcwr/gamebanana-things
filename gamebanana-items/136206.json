There is more then 1 way to get to the other side: Two main doors, two side obstacles, and a great bridge. It's a GunGame map, but I'm making it also for normal game play. I'll add buy zones, and a bomb site, hostages were on my mind, but, the map is a bit too small for that, so I'm sticking with the two.\r\nMy name in-game is »P-T« &#1084;&#953;&#954;&#949;, so I added a rotating 'MIKE', in the middle. Problem is, that it rotates on the Y axis, I want it to rotate horizontally, can you tell me how to? It has a rotating sound. The doors are shoot activated, touch activated, and use activated. Once again, more then one way to get across to enemy territory. Tell me what you think about it."
