	"_sText": "This map is a warehouse sort of. I focused mainly on the gameplay. I had a great idea for a knife map, and I worked that out. I hope you like it as much as I do.\r\n\r\nIt works like this:\r\nThe terrorists spawn upstairs. They will run to a bunch of \"moving blocks\" (press use to activate them). When their blocks move down, the blocks downstairs, at the ct spawn, will move up, resulting in a lot of fun I hope :). I guess you have to see it to understand it. I tried to explain in screenshot two as well. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nInstall instructions:\r\nExtract the ka_deadlift.bsp file to your counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps folder."
