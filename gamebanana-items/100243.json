It would be cool to give a new look to this     great map... I heard on servers   that everybody was a bit tired of  the  legendary \"plaster/offwllc\" so I hope you will  enjoy  the \"renovations\" (sorry i'm french). \r\n\r\nCUSTOMISATION:\r\n\r\n- FPS and etc:   VERY GOOD  ... try it you'll love it !!!! \r\n\r\nI begun the work with a cs_office.vmf file found on the web  in fact I did'nt used Vmex... But Anyway had very poor fps and an endless time of compiling.  I promise people try yourself to use a vmex vmf of a css original map and you'll see the crap result . I have to play The DOCTOR lol to have something can start begin to work with. Lights.. props .. the skybox etc ( the skybox was a road to hell) ... AT first try I had very low fps...  NOw ... The Map is Really FAST !  and my PC is prehistorical ^^  \r\n\r\n- Ambiance \r\n\r\nI really tried my best not to modify cs_office the  wrong way guys :( . as you can see i did 'nt try to build some kind of new stupid ways into the map ! I JUST tried to make something that will look a little bit more \" A LA MODE \"  like we are saying in france lol !  About the outside places . The lights are bright enough so you can see the enemy.   no problem ^^\r\n                        \r\n - Materials \r\n      \r\nHope you will like my \"redluxwood\" texture The wood is a bit shiny and luxious.  The black board texture. If you use it You\"ll see \"security archives, etc etc\" many names you don't see in the map. Please use it !!\r\n                               \r\n- Radar: \r\n\r\nDon't know if you like it but I changed the colours of the radar style !  ( grey ingame ) ( blue when dead)                                      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n    \r\n    - RAFIK   department of defense texture and The illuminati logo texture.\r\n\r\n    - [DNv]Cross       ...white corridor texture. I Love it !! \r\n\r\n    - Chizbone       Thx for the Perfect nav file !\r\n\r\n   - skybox texture     sky_starfield  found on fps banana some month ago\r\n                                   thx to the author .. but the file seems to had been erase . :( ( can't find \r\n                                   back his name )\r\n\r\n    - PatriotMaudit      testing and camp debunking \r\n   \r\n     - aos SEAL aka predulus      My master in mapping ^^ \r\n\r\n\r\n   !!!!
