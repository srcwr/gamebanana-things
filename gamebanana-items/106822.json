I now it's not very good designed, but at some point it's also interesting to play at this map, isn't it? However the map isn't long, so you can't really go wrong way to the opponents. In my opinion the 3D sky fit maybe a part of the map... but I want to hear your comments and your opions about it, so start! I also included a NAV file for bot paths in the .bsp so you don't need to create it. But at last I wish you a happy playing on my map.\r\n\r\nPlayed on deathmatch mode and was still amazing.\r\nProperties\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Map Version: V2.0\r\n- Working Progress: 3 days\r\n- map in dust style\r\n- sky 3D included\r\n- NAV file included\r\n- fight with deagle and knife\r\n- an interesting tactical gaming\r\n- simple map structure\r\n- dust atmosphere (lightwind sound)\r\n<br />\r\nBug Reports\r\n-----------\r\nPlease report all bugs on the GameBanana comments page.\r\n<br />\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\nTo read all changes pls watch in <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/updates/178899\">Updates</a> section\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n<p><center><font color=\"Lightgreen\">Please leave comments, rate, give feedback and subscribes if you like.</font></center></p>"
