	"_sText": " If ur wondering about the crappy screenshots then blame my graphic card, its many years old. many fun features and there are 2 buyzones for each team - thats for u to find out (hint - be a man, dont be scared!)\r\n\r\n Many fun features. CTs start on top and in the quartered glass area and Ts start under the mysterious walls with the collumn. Things that go straight are climable, usually.\r\n\r\nAbout the weapons: There are Grenades spawned at the top of the map close to the CTs and EVERYONE starts with a knife, a deagle, a tmp, and 1 clip (no backup clips)\r\n\r\nSome phoney lasers, some real ones, lots of disko effects and stuff. Lighting is nice - not fullbright (cuz fullbright sux ass) and there are 2 special easter eggs. One of them is a wall extension and the other is something to do with \"unbreakable\" glass shield :)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map ;)"
