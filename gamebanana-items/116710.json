If someone knows how to fix this please comment/pm me.\r\n\r\nMap is not protected from decompiling, because I would like other people to learn from this map, I would like to see other (training) maps with moving targets/parts.\r\nPM me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nType this in console to refill your ammo:\r\nsv_cheats 1\r\nimpulse 101\r\n\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\" size=\"7\"><font size=\"2\"><b>Please comment and assess.</b></font></font>\r\n- Black\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n- Valve\r\n- PrivateParts</font>"
