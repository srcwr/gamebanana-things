	"_sText": "This is a highly detailed hostage rescue map. It has been very popular on my server ever since I released it for beta testing. People always extend it for several hours and say that by gameplay and detail it is better than cs_compound and de_port. Well, you be the judge. Download the map and see for yourself. \r\nSome of the fun stuff in the map: breakable walls, secret places and hiding/sniping spots, a hydraulic press that can be used to crash people, a toggleable light in the hostage building; it can also be shot out. Besides that you have very detailed graphics and loads of strategies and approach areas around the map. Have fun. Hope you enjoy it. P.S. Leave your comments about the map here or e-mail me at klevenskiy@gmail.com please.\r\n"
