	"_sText": "This map was mostly inspired by shotty and I added a few extra things.  There is a player crusher located in the center of the map on the second floor.  Buttons to activate this crusher are located in either teams spawn points.  This has been tested on a fairly popular server and I have found that a majority of players so far have enjoyed it once they become accustomed to what the map offers.  \r\n\r\nUpdates in the future are possible if there is any interest in this map."
