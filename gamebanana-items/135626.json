Lord Azael came up with the idea for this map and provided Karnage with designs. The idea was inspired by gg_project_funkeh (made by [LL] Sibby) which has extraordinarily large ladders. The idea came about during a knife fight on said ladders. Many thanks to Llama Lords for ideas/support/testing\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease visit the clan website www.llamalords.co.uk\r\nThis map can be uploaded to other download portals if needs be.\r\nAsk my permission before editing or decompiling the map.\r\nSteam: explosivose\r\n\r\nLL ftw ^_^"
