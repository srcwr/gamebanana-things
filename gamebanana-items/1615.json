	"_sText": "Are you tired of people whining and saying, \"OMFG! You spawn campz0r!\" Or are you tired of it yourself? Do you just want those pesky spawn-campers with their flashbangs and M249s to just go away? Well, I'm afraid that I can't make that happen, but you yourself can make it not a problem with this prefab. Yes, If you make a map using this, and you don't have any teleports leading into either of the spawns, then your spawn-camper days are officially over. Now how does it work? Well it's quite simple really. The area which would originally be open so you could jump out, but people from the top could jump in and people from the opposing spawn could trick jump in is now guarded by a sheet of glass. The exit is a straight shot from the back, forward then downward.\r\n\r\nAnyway, modify it to your liking, most likely the texturing, but you can remove the blocker on the front and whatnot, just make sure to credit me somehow. I myself am using this, and everyone in my clan who plays surf loves the prefab, so I'm gonna share it with you all.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In order to make it launch rather than drop, simply remove the front piece."
