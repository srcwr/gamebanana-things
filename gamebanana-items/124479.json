Mostly just a break from that arduous task.&nbsp;<br><br>Lighting is mostly a combinaton of some blue glass, and some skybox. Originally it was just blue glass and white lights, but that made some of the stages incredibly dark.<br><br>Stages: 8<br>Bonus: Yes<br>Time: 20 sec - 1 min<br>Difficulty: Easy - Medium (Bonus is kinda hard tho)<br><br><br><br>A couple skips here and there in the main map, one big skip in the bonus, but you need like 600+ SSJ to do it without prespeed."
