I'm not planning to modify the map further. The file is big because of songs in it. Due to big delay I can't really give v1 to v2 changelog. That you see, it's dark. And really dark. And it's on purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd again due to delay, I don't remember anyone to give credits. So if you are unsatisfied because I forgot you, write me and I will add you to credits. \r\n\r\nIf you want, I'll give out the .vmf, under two conditions. 1) write me that you want .vmf 2) if you don't have at least one released map, don't bother yourself with step one ;)\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
