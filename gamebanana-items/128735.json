The Ts are the spies and are trying to steal the \"intel\" from the CTS. The Ts have 5 mins to do this.\r\n\r\n***Spies***\r\n\r\n- Smoke grenade\r\n- Spy suit (black)\r\n- Night vision goggles\r\n- Low grav (80%)\r\n- Health Regeneration\r\n- USP\r\n- Partly invisible\r\n- Body Armour\r\n\r\n***CTs***\r\n\r\n- USP\r\n- MP5\r\n- 150 HP\r\n- Grenade\r\n- Body Armour\r\n\r\nThe spies have to first steal the keycard that's behind the front desk, and then bring the keycard to a room on the second floor. Then they have to take the briefcase from that room and bring it back to their spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Generator: Found in back of basement and when the button to it is shot, all the lights will shut off for 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n- 2 Splinter cell songs \r\n\r\n- Armour in basement (has to be unlocked from a room on the first floor).\r\n\r\n- Secret deagle which makes anyone carrying it 100% invisible\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n***PICTURES***\r\n\r\n 1. Layout of Map\r\n 2. Armoury Room\r\n 3. Bathroom\r\n 4. Room with Intel\r\n 5. Random Room\r\n 6.
