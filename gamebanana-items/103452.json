Thompson.  \r\nTheir mission is to extract his Gonzo powers. There \r\nare two places that might be suitable for the spirit \r\nrevival, the big house, and the cabin in the woods. \r\nTerrorists, wanting to protect Thompson's dead ass, \r\nhave decided to intervene.\r\n\r\nCTs: Eliminate the threat of the terrorist team, \r\nthen perform your spirit revivals.\r\n\r\nTs: Blow up the two locations so there is no chance \r\nthe CTs can hold their spirit revivals. Killing is optional.\r\n\r\n***********************************\r\nShoutouts:\r\n\r\nThanks to Hellboy for the story idea, and the \r\n\"I AM THE OWL\" texture.\r\n\r\nThanks to NIPPER for inspiration, as always! and \r\nhis bug-spotting in my map.\r\n\r\nThanks to Ayeyah for being a bitch.
