I used some free time to convert this map while working on a full fledged bomb/defuse map for CS source.\r\n\r\nI used existing resources from CSS / HL2. No new textures/materials, no new sounds, no new models. I also kept the layout of the original map without adding new areas; however, I added lots of details and a 3D skybox.\r\n\r\nThe map is small to medium size fitting up to 20 players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nSimply extract the 4 files in the zip archive to your \\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps folder\r\n\r\nI have included a nav file for offline play with bots.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map and have fun playing it as I had fun making it\r\n\r\n\r\nWill2k\r\n\r\nDecember 28, 2010"
