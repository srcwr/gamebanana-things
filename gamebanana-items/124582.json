	"_sText": "This map is one of ArcticPanda's old projects that he didn't finish, he didn't ever intend to touch it again so I wanted to put a spin on it and publish it, at least 70% of the gameplay in this map was originally by him, I just added to the map, designed it, optimized it and so on.&nbsp; A lot of people liked the japanese theme of blossom, so I decided to put that twist into this map, map has 9 stages, each one getting more difficult than the last, and a bonus.&nbsp; FYI this map is the polar opposite of the original blossom, which was an easy linear strafe map. This map is staged, and the last stages can be pretty challenging, not very hard to beat the map but pretty difficult to nofail it. Will be sticking to my regular 40s-1:30 maps after this, I just wanted to publish something a bit different and harder.&nbsp; Feel free to leave feedback about this style of bhop.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWTE_MK7oNA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
