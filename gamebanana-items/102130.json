All measurements were taken from the original but this is technically a complete rebuild with a futuristic, industrial theme, lighting adjustments and a few fun extras.<br><br>- 30 players per team (60 total)<br><br>Update 10/12 @ 12:15pm: I found an accidentally placed additional terrorist spawn point in the middle of the map that I didn't catch before compiling the map so it's been updated with this removed. The .nav was updated as well to reflect this.<br><br><br>NOTE: Files now read as \"de_dust_2043\" for the update, so please take note if you've already added this to your server! Thanks!"
