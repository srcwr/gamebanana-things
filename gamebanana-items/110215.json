	"_sText": "Dodgeball is an exciting spin to the basic knife arena soccer maps. Use a knife to fling the ball at the opponent to knock them out, being careful not to foot fault or get hit yourself. EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE, Especially for a large group of people.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this map was though up by Speedkill33, who made the original version, however it was simply a square piece of cement with a non working ball."
