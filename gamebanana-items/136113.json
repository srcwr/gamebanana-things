	"_sText": "Hiya Guys :D\r\n\r\nThis is my first map I post on the internet so I really don't know what to expect.\r\nThe map itself took me about 10 hours work in total.\r\nIt's like a medium gg map with in the centre a tower. At the top of the tower you can shoot the vent so you drop down. (No hp lose because of water). Then you just can shoot down the walls at the end so you can pass in like 4 directions.\r\nIn general it's just a really simple gungame map.\r\n\r\nAnd now I just want your opinions about it.\r\nI'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nGrtz Jens "
