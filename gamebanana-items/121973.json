Surf_Dynasty is a brand new, fully original linear/combat map that satisfies just about any surfers desires. If you're more into the combat side, there are copious amounts of weapons to acquire at spawn for you to duke it out with. For someone looking for a serious surfing experience, anti spawn camping precautions have been set up so no one can interfere with your surfing.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 minutes, your screen will shake indicating the round is over. all players will be teleported to the lower tier of jail on their respective side if they haven't left spawn or have failed since time ran out. If you reached the checkpoint, you will have been teleported to jail with a better weapon and position advantage. You will also retain a higher health. If you finish the map or bonus, you will get the strongest weapon plus the best location in jail as well as your health.\r\n\r\nThere is a bonus located somewhere in the middle of the surf, be warned though, many have attempted this secret stage, but very few have succeeded.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is an abundance of secrets in the spawn area, some are easy to attain and some are quite dastardly. Also, shoot the gong."
