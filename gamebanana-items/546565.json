I'm keeping the latest update as downloadable and also the user's custom requests with -custom.rar extension. Let me know if you have issues or have requests.<br><br>OG Post: this map is terrible but the idea is cool. basically training CQB area. i dont like it and not interested in working on it anymore but dont want to waste it. i put all the hammer files in the rar if you want to play with it.<br><br>updated by request: added hdr lighting, fixed some meshes added more screenshots, fixed spawn issue, added props<br>"
