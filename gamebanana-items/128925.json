	"_sText": "ba prison confused v1\r\n\r\nAt this map, I wanted to make a contrast between two places. I mean that Cts will spawn at a nice place where they will get weapons pressing a button of buying them, and the prisioners will start at a basement where walls have got blood, zombies shuting, electrical fences, a dirty infirmary...\r\n\r\nIf you want to go to the basements, you must take the elevators. Terrorist are divided at two places so Cts have to go to differents jails.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of details:\r\n\r\n1º In a jail, there is a zombie shouting.\r\n2º Buttons with spawn weapons will lock after about 50 scounds so Ts will not be able to steal them.\r\n3º There is a button where you can turn off the lights of the map so Terrorist can stay in a corner and Cts can see them.\r\n4º Electrical fence with give realism.\r\n5º A pool dirty where if you are lucker, you can find a weapon. But it do not usually happen because weapons will not spawn at the same place.\r\n6ºIf you press the button to go up and the elevator go down, get ready to kill a zombie or he will kill you.\r\n7ºThere are two basements so there are two infirmaries.\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\nMap tasted at the server Zumbados Armados with ip 109.68.86.21:27016\r\nMap tasted by the players legend and lunny epileptico\r\n\r\n"
