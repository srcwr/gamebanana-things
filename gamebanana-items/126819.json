	"_sText": "Hmm.  Well, As you may or may not know -- Deathrun_Amazon_b3 was released.. three years ago.  \r\n\r\nI had done a lot of editing to it since then, but I never really did get around to releasing it.  I just found out that the map itself is rather popular on Garry's mod deathrun servers (sassilization, represent!) so I decided to finally add the finishing touches and release it.\r\n\r\nThe map is still rather \"Amateurish\" as the bulk of it was made.. well.. three years ago, but the heart is still there.  \r\n\r\nSome of the major changes include\r\n\r\n- Fixing the speed of the water rising.\r\n\r\n- Editing some traps to go along with the theme.\r\n\r\n- Optimization.\r\n\r\n- Texture fixes\r\n\r\nThere were a few more, but i mean.. I did most of them ages ago, so I can't exactly remember.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI really don't plan on releasing this again, unless there is some cataclysmic problem."
