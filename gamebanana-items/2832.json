	"_sText": "This is my advanced elevator prefab. It is so far impossible to glitch this elevator in any way. I added lamps to show where the elevator is, and when it will get to your floor. The elevator itself is not blockable by any players.\r\n\r\nI've added a elevator soundscape into the prefab, and some sounds when the elevator is moving and stopping. The lights in the elevator is also working great.\r\n\r\nUse it as much as you want.\r\nCredits is required if you are gonna use this prefab, but you think that this is a problem, please contact me, and we may find another solution.\r\n\r\nThank you."
