This is a zombie map so it can be challenging due to the ammount of fog in the area.  travel at your own risk, there could be a zombie behind you!   If your lucky enough, 1 CT and 1 T spawn in the corner.  This map has a max of 32 players and it's at it's best when there are more players in the game."
