	"_sText": "Ok, so this was inspired by well, the picture that shows when there is a texture missing. It's pretty trippy. I made all the textures, except the black one, but besides that I made them all. It's made for gg_deagle servers. It's pretty fun, I played it with bots and it was crazy. It has 32 spawn points, in a row. Some are not really even, but its fine."
