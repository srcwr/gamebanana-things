I know the textures are boring adn the lightings rubbish but it feels good to have made something that works :D\r\n\r\nIm using this to learn from and chucked in some unnecessary things, like breakable stuff and doors and stairs, etc. i hope to improve significantly \r\n\r\nBut still play it cause it is decent even if its just to laugh at it :) any feedback is good as long as it aint \"This is ****\" \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nBtw Bots are actually good on this map... \r\nand the screenshots are rubbish cause i dunno how to disable hud properly ... :$"
