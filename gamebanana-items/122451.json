	"_sText": "My first combat surf map!\r\n\r\nIn this map, you start off in an isolated spawn point and fly to the arena. You then gain a lot of speed and try to maintain it whilst killing the enemies. Guns are spread across the map and the better ones are in harder to reach areas. Have fun!\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a beta, if you encounter any bugs, PLEASE tell me! So I can improve it for the final release.\r\n\r\nI know that a bit of the shading is messed up. If you know how to fix it tell me :D\r\nTextures by me\r\nAmazing skybox by the one and only Karatekaefer \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHeres me getting owned on my own map\r\n(please note that this video was taken in an alpha version of the map so it looks different)\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"387\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.wegame.com/static/flash/player2.swf\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.wegame.com/static/flash/player2.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"480\" height=\"387\" flashvars=\"tag=I_got_pwned_on_my_own_map\"></embed></object><div><a href=\"http://www.wegame.com/game/CS Source/\" target=\"_blank\">WeGame.com - CS Source Videos</a></div>\r\n\r\nNow in Beta2!
