The map was fine and playable, but it was orange dev themed, and it still needed tweaks. When CS:S caught my attention I re-opened the project and set about porting it across and improving it.</b></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>When creating this map I&nbsp;considered gameplay balance as paramount. I&nbsp;took the easy road and made it symmetrical to start off, and then planned out the level on paper several times before even going into Hammer. The key focus to this level is to make it feel enclosed, but always providing more than one option of where to go next. Not only that, but also to keep the gameplay three dimensional.&nbsp;This isn't a forwards and backwards map, I've made sure to create lots of high ground and low ground throughout to provide this 3D&nbsp;experience.</b></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Finally, the texturing which was originally orange became what it is now.&nbsp; A&nbsp;mix of hard concrete blocks, white brick walls, tiled floor and all brought together by yellow neon embelishments. Not the best ever, but it seems to fit. The concrete definately emphasises the WW2-like bunkers in the level.</b><b><br /></p>\r\n<hr size=\"2\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(255, 153, 0);\"><font size=\"3\">Includes:</font></span><br />\r\n32 spawns<br />\r\nBalanced symmetrical layout<br />\r\nWorking radar<br />\r\nWorking nav mesh<br />\r\nCustom textures<br />\r\n</b></p>\r\n<hr size=\"2\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>\r\n</b>Please rate and assess.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Enjoy!</b></p>"
