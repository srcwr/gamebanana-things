I feel I did quite well in it, but some constructive criticism would be nice.\r\n\r\n------\r\njust your standard small aim map, dust themed and outdoors. Its functional , there are no known gameplay problems or bugs, I wouldent have uploaded it if there were.\r\n\r\nIf you like the map, please show love, by registering on www.gamerslife.dpclan.co.uk thank you."
