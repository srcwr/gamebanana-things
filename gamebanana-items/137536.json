	"_sText": "This is an edit from my origonal version of holy_crap_its_brick. In the origonal version I got a few complaints saying that some of the doors weren't wide enough and were hard to go through, so to make it easier to navigate through the map, I widened the doors. I got a complaint about the windows in the top tower (the biggest tower) being too small, so I make those wider. I also added an underground tunnel with teleporters in it to teleport you to the top of the new 4 towers. The 4 new towers are now the highest part of the map instead of the large tower in the middle. I also spread the spawn points out more to prevent blocking at spawn.\r\n\r\nI had a 3d skybox but the map just didn't look good with it, so I got rid of it.\r\n\r\nwell, I hope you all enjoy the changes I've made and please tell me about any problems you have with the map that I can improve on."
