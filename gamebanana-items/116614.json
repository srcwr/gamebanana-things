It's a DE map with bomb sites in the cabin's dining room and the outhouse. Yes, inside the outhouse.\r\nAs I said, it's a small map so I wouldn't recommend running it with a huge load of players, although the map supporst up to 32 players, if you \r\nreally want to run it like that...\r\n\r\nIt is also my first ever CS:S map so yay for me for actually making a CS:S map... Although I don't play CS:S very much and therefore propably \r\nwon't see the map \"in action\". I also don't expect too much from the map as it was only a small project for the holidays.\r\nHope you like it, and I don't care if you don't like it. :)\r\n\r\n*** Merry Christmas, FPSBanana! ***"
