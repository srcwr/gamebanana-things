	"_sText": "This is a second version of my olde fy_killhouse map.  I've improved lighting and light maps, added more physics props, improved general layout, added railing to upper floor platforms/bridges, and have done a few other tweaks.\r\n\r\nfy_killhouse and fy_killhouse_2 are based on Killhouse B from MGS3: Subsistence's online multiplayer mode.  I take inspiration from the Metal Gear series, Kojima Productions, and Konami.  This map is takes 12 players max, take that into account before hosting a game.  Please, put this on your server/download the map!  "
