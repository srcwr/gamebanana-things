	"_sText": "<b>Version 1</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nFun Gungame Map which I created when a server wanted a few more maps, i wasn't going to release it but I decided to today.\r\n\r\nThe map is a texture map if you didnt notice by the screenshots, has two spawns with t's and ct's, the map is quite small but can be fun on most gungame servers...\r\n\r\nThere is one tower at either side of the spawns, so if the server has RPG which alot of gungame servers do... it wont spoil the fun too mutch by being killed by higher levels, There is 4 routes to take from spawn even though its a small map its spaced out so theres room to move and not always be faced with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe lighting on the map is also good as you see good shadows from the sun, I have beta tested this map 6 times so there shouldn't be any problems.\r\n\r\nHopfully this map is what your looking for!\r\n\r\nEnjoy ;)\r\n\r\n<b>Version 2</b>\r\n\r\nI have added breakable floor to reduce camping and added an extra room so that spawn camping wont be as annoying, also I have changed a few bits to make it slightly better, also at the T's spawn theres no longer a \"invisible wall\" where it stops you having to jump.\r\n\r\nAny good or bad comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks & Enjoy."
