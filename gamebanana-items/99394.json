You'll find only a few minor modifications to this map from its original version on AA.  Other than that, you'll find it familiar.  This map is good for any number of players, from 2 to 64, and is ready to handle that many players design- and spawnpoint-wise.  Please enjoy this map and thanks for viewing."
