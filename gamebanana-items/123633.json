I did not make a big, but very good map.<br><br>In this card there are puzzles that need to overcome levels, where you need to go forward, press buttons, shoot, get a flash drive, look for ways to go forward, and also with a return back.<br><br>I took the text from the hammer itself and from my previous kz map (kZ FlaSh).<br><br>When I tested the map, knowing all the passes, I passed it in 20 minutes, again I managed to pass for 9. The masters jumping succeed and for 7 minutes to go through map.<br><br>I did not record the video. But if someone writes a video, I'll attach it here, if I do not do this myself ...<br><br>I really hope that you will enjoy playing on my map!<br><br>Have a good game!"
