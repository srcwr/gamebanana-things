	"_sText": "In previous versions, the grenades in gun game wouldn't bounce of the boxes.  I have corrected that issue.  There was also an issue with bullets going through the middle of the boxes.  I think I have that corrected, but I have yet to be able to prove the bullets aren't going through the middle of the boxes when they shouldn't be.  Fixed the texture on the ladders leading up to the rafters as well."
