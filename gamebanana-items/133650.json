This is why the map size is almost 9mb, but its only about 3.5mb when zipped with bzip2.\r\n\r\nmaximum players:       36\r\nrecommended players: 20 - 30\r\n\r\nAnyway hope you enjoy, please assess the map and tell me what you think.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nthanks to Karatekäfer for the skybox, and thanks to the many people who created some of these sounds which were later edited by me for this map.\r\n\r\nelliotuk"
