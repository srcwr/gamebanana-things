The surrounding areas have been evacuated and there is a four-block quarantine for fear that the Terrorists could use bio-bombs.\r\n\r\n<i>The map features:</i>\r\n<b><b class=\"orange\">*</b>HDR\r\n<b class=\"orange\">*</b>Soundscapes\r\n<b class=\"orange\">*</b>Overview\r\n<b class=\"orange\">*</b>Hand-Tuned Nav file\r\n<b class=\"orange\">*</b>Various Custom Content\r\n<b class=\"orange\">*</b>40 Player Spawns\r\n<b class=\"orange\">*</b>2 Bomb Sites</b>\r\n\r\nIt took me about 3 months to develop this project. It has 100 direct lights, 9583 faces, 8 displacements and <i>lots of time and coffee.</i> \r\n\r\nCompile times:\r\n<b class=\"green\">vbsp</b> = 16 seconds\r\n<b class=\"blue\">vvis</b> = 23 minutes, 13 seconds\r\n<b class=\"red\">vrad</b> = 1 hour, 44 minutes, 48 seconds + 1 hour, 51 minutes, 20 seconds\r\n<b class=\"orange\">Total</b> = 3 hours, 59 minutes, 37 seconds\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's layout is similar to the layout of the rooftop of the Mercy Hospital from Left 4 Dead. However it has tons of differences as you can see from the screenshots.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to everyone who contributed in the creation of this project especially <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/2768\" target=\"_blank\">Nay0r</a>. If I'm forgetting to credit any tester, please notify me.\r\n\r\n<i><b class=\"orange\"><big>HAVE FUN!!!</BIG></b></i>\r\n\r\nAlso, if you liked the map and think that I've done a good job with it or appreciate the fact that I've put lots of effort into this, vote for me as Mapper of the Month.
