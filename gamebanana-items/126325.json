The teleports to the levels allow you to keep your speed expect for 1 because it would open up a skip to a whole section. It is made to be played on autohop settings.&nbsp;<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>Materials</b></span>:&nbsp; All of the textures are default. Pcpie's booster prefab was used for boosters.<a href=\"http://\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/prefabs/7118\">https://gamebanana.com/prefabs/7118</a><br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>info/problems</b></span>:&nbsp; I made this map back in 2015-2016 but never released it. I didn't really understand how to do lighting then so some levels have light entities spammed everywhere.&nbsp; I'm releasing it now because I think some people will have fun with it."
