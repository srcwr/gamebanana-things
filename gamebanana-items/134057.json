	"_sText": "A weekend project. Started it yesterday, finished it tonight. No big project but it turned out ok.\r\nI don't know if it has been done before, it probably has been, but this map is made fully out of cards. So no ladders, railings, boxes... just cards. A lot of cards. \r\n-Map built from nothing but cards\r\n-Support up to 50 players, but that's not recommended\r\n-Custom Textures\r\n-Lighting with colour correction\r\n-3d-skybox(the room)\r\n-Joker-button. Allows one person to be teleported to the top of the middle tower\r\n-No .nav file, bots really suck on this\r\n\r\nMade by: SmOoth.nl\r\nInspiration:www.cardstacker.com (I do realise it looks nothing like what he makes)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\nSmOoth.nl\r\n\r\n"
