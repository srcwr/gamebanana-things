	"_sText": "Hello and welcome to SURF _ PARC _ COLORE!\r\n\r\nMap Data:\r\nSo this is a staged Skillsurf map with 6 Levels and 4 Bonus Levels. Every Level is based on a Color. The Bonus Levels are all different: \r\nthe first is invcluded in the main map (Screen 1-3)\r\nIn the second Bonus i tried to make a new design and the \"Birdcage-Bonus\" was born. The third bonus was originally made for annother map more than a year ago. Now I just put it in this map because the other project was never finished. The forth Bonus Level is just a \"broken\" combination of the Levels 1 and 2 of surf_Sunset2.\r\nI also added a fifth door at the bonus floor which gets open when sunset2 bonus is finished!\r\nthis is just a simple Funjump that is made for all guys who finished the map because it has no jail!\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nYou have to follow all rails with the same light-color of the start point to pass a Level. There is a Ãƒï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¯Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¯Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½endplattformÃƒï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¯Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¯Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½ for every Level in the same color like the lights. After touching this you can go to the center of the map. The the teleporter you used already at the spawn will teleport you to the next Level !\r\n\r\nI hope you understand everything I wrote ^^\r\nGood Luck and have fun playing this map :D\r\n\r\nAlso here is the Video of how to surf the map:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SgMd_2TxH2k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
