However after playing around with textures and layout I converted it to a 1800-1900's style.  This isn't a very explored theme within Css and especially not gun game.  Allowing me to create a unique realistic map.\r\n\r\nIn Development:\r\nThis map isn't finished it is currently in a beta phase after being tested and improved on the alpha version which was private.  Therefore people note any suggestions would help me to improve the map, I know it is quite big for a gungame map but I wished to create something different and unique to which I believe I have succeeded.  I am currently looking at developing a system to open different paths depending on the level of players.  As well as potentially making the map smaller so it works better but I need people to test it first and give their feedback.\r\n\r\n\tCheck List: 1) 3d Skybox  2) Details\r\n\r\nAlso: All DECENT feedback is welcome :D\r\n\r\nThanks for interest in my map!\r\nalex (terrora/ roluffy)"
