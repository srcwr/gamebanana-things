	"_sText": "Hello, i AM the original Maker of this Map, and i will be coming out with more... dj stands for DeathJump...the Point of the game/map is that the CT and T starts atthe bottom, and they have to try to get passed all the Auto-Traps and wen u reach to the top theres Guns and once u get the guns u shall go into the portal and it will teleport u into a room i call it the Battle Room, because once u teleport into that room your trapped in there waiting for more ppl from the other team to come in and start war! :) Please dont be rude and leave Negative comments because this is my FIRST Map ever made.I Also came up with the Idea myself. i Thought of it. wanted to make it happen! and now it happened lol.
