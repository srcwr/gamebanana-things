There are camping spots for those who love camping, and barricading spots for those who love barricading. This can be an alternative to zm_lila_panic during low population timings.\r\nI have ensured that every spot is useful, so every space in this small map area can be fully utilised.\r\n\r\n-64/64 spawnpoints\r\n-Cubemaps (compiled)\r\n-LDR\r\n-Compiled in Normal BSP, VIS and RAD\r\n-Good FPS\r\n\r\nJoin FireWaLL // Zombie at 206.212.243.130:27015 to try out the map and other FireWaLL maps, or visit our website at www.FireWaLLCS.net/forums."
