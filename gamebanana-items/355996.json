Thanks and respects go to \r\nBlack Mesa Source team (borrowed some of the office props: to make it \r\nclear - assets have been taken from the MOD version, downloaded legally \r\nat the time it was free), CS:GO creators for the magnificent vertigo 3D \r\nskybox. One bomb plant point, 16 spawn points per team. Greets and \r\nthanks go to QFactor for the canteen soundtrack (well, I did the bass on\r\n it, yeah :)<br><br>Peace!<br><br>PS. This is basically a bugfix release based on <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/101302\">this</a> deprecated map.<br><br>Update: fixed 3D skybox alignment (reported by <a class=\"MemberLink\" href=\"https://gamebanana.com/members/1770670\">JAM_HK416</a>: see comment below).<br>"
