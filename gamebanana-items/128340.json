	"_sText": "<b>MG_MK_ABSTRACT</b> BY UNREAL\r\n\r\nMG_MK stands for mini-game mortal kombat, this is the second map to be released on other upcoming maps of its style. This game-mod basicly consists in punching your enemies down. In this map I was looking forward to make something fun, actractive and not boring to play, its a random simetrical platform, with two ramps on each side that boost players, and a healing thingy on the top platform and it is reachable as long as bunnyhopping is enabled.\r\n\r\nNote: Knife damage was removed on this level, so punching is the only way to kill enemies.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys like it and have fun!\r\n\r\nwww.FRAGXL.com\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
