	"_sText": "AS_ version of this map http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/12331\r\n\r\nBasically, I compiled this version over 2 years ago and fully intended on releasing it at the same time as the CS_ version.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone to test the map to make sure the VIP stuff worked correctly so it sat on my hard drive for the last 2 years.  Someone happened to message me about it recently and I thought I'd just release it.\r\n\r\n***NOTE***  I never tested this map on a server to make sure the VIP entities work, so if you download this and find that it doesn't work on your server then PLEASE leave a message here and I'll trash the release.  I no longer have the original map file so I can't make any alterations or fix any issues, so it either works or it doesn't.\r\n\r\nThanks"
