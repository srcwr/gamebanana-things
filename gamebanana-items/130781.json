I've added blocked hallways so it's a sort of maze to get to the upper floor, then into the building with all the vending machines. Humans must then barricade themselves in, press the button, and wait for the escape door to open. Once it does, they run down a large hallway and underground into the bunker zone, where they must wait for an earthquake to pass.\r\n\r\nRemember that this is a beta release. There are bound to be some bugs, but I playtested it and couldn't find anything wrong with it, to I figured I'd release it to the public for everyone to test.\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy! =D\r\nComments, stamps, and assessments are welcome.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative\r\n"
