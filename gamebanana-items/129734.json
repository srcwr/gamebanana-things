When in race mode everyone but the first person \r\nwill get slayed once the first person touches the finish line.),\r\nfixed some bugs and added a door to the medic (heal) room (use opens).\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\nA very small \"leak\" glitch appears on the side of the simon says room\r\nslightly sticking out of the wall. I am unable to fix this for now, since\r\nworking with the simon says room is VERY hard (don't worry, its only visual and VERY hard to spot unless you inspect all nooks and cranies on the map, chances are 99.99% of the people in your server won't see it). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nPS. Due to lack of playtesters i was unable to properly test my new race setup, so feedback on that would be appreciated. Everything else was playtested ither from me or playtested with more people back when the map was still 1.0 \r\n"
