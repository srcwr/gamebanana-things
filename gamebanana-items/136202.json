	"_sText": "-=gg_proximus=-\r\n\r\nMy first and probably last Gun Game map ever.\r\n\r\nThe map is created for an average gungame server. It has 96 T and 96 CT spawns.\r\nIt is fully symmetrical.\r\n\r\nWhen you die, your dead body will be sucked into space.\r\n\r\nThere is also a secret. There are two invisible buttons. Can you find them?\r\nIf you press them all, there will be a 1/5th chance the secret will be activated. You cannot be more camouflaged if you manage to activate the secret properly.\r\n\r\nThanks to Shini for the skybox and Defekt for the textures.\r\nAnd thanks to Pendulum Studio for all the feedback.\r\n\r\n/Helix\r\n\r\nWarning: There is a chance of low fps in the middle of the map. Good graphic card computers will have less trouble with this. I did not have a bad fps drop, just a small one.\r\n\r\nWarning 2: I did not put a game_player_equip entity in it, so if you start without the mod you will get a knife and your secondary gun. (glock/usp). I don't know if this will conflict with the GG mod."
