	"_sText": "Players spawn in random locations in the central area, however the two raised platforms are team specific. The aim of the players on platforms is to eliminate the players of the opposing team in the central or opposite platform on the map. Once all the players of a single team who spawn in the centre of the map have died, all the remaining players of that team will die. Therefore the central players can exterminate the entire opposing team just by killing the enemies in the centre.\r\n\r\nPlatform to platform attacks are also available, however due to the protecting glass, there are safe spaces at the corners of the platforms."
