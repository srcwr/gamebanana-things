I have used simple shapes to promote all areas of the performance. I want others to take this from here.\r\n\r\n3 gravity lifts, and a few strategically placed jumping ledges and gravity lift tricks which truly help a veteran player around the map.\r\n\r\nThis map I found is amazing for snipers. \r\nIt has long corridors of open sight. Its easy to hunt, good natural cover built into the landscape of hexagons.\r\n\r\nThe framerates I get are good. 100+ \r\n\r\nMy lighting is of course my own blend of lights.rad thanks to: Sgt.Mess/Lost/Twixxx\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks goes out to the Danger Zone Studio for helping me beta test this many many times.\r\n\r\nThis has been over 24 hours of mapping time.\r\n22 compiles.\r\n\r\n\r\ngood times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease download this map.\r\n\r\nIts a gooder."
