	"_sText": "Hey everyone. I got the idea to make a fun CT vs. T rush/camping minigame map from smee tower so I decided to make a map that would have gameplay similar to that, but more fun, more camping spots, more excitement, and more alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe map consists of many spots:\r\n\r\n-outside area where t's spawn\r\n-a basement under the 1st floor of the bar\r\n-1st floor of the bar\r\n-2nd floor of the bar\r\n-a roof above the 2nd floor of the bar\r\n\r\n*There are tunnels that can go from the outside area to the 1st floor or to the basement. Also, there are 3 ladders that can go from the outside area to the roof.\r\n\r\nAs the game starts, T's make their way to the front of the bar (or go the basement route/roof route) then break down the doors and try to kill all the CT's protecting the bar. (CT's spawn in the bar). CT's have numerous places to camp, including knocking over tables and hiding behind them, hiding behind the bar counter, etc. The game is over when all T's are dead or all CT's are dead, or the bomb blows up when planted.\r\n\r\n*There is a bomb site on the large table on the second floor.\r\n\r\n********On the roof facing the T spawn, there is an invisible wall so CT's cannot shoot the T's as they approach the bar.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHave fun and please leave feedback!\r\n"
