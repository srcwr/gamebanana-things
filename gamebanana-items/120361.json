This is CampinClams first map.\r\n\r\nThere are T's and CT's in this map. You start off on glass. When the round begins you can buy your weapons. I would preferably buy a shotgun. Shoot the glass to drop down to the trampoline.\r\n\r\nCC stands for CampinClams. Not Chery Clan.\r\n\r\nEnjoy CampinClams map. :)\r\n"
