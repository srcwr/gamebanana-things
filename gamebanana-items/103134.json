	"_sText": "Hi! We present to you our map “de_militarybase_gigifty” (bomb/defuse mission) for \"Counter-Strike: Source\".<br>This map was made from scratch and represent a block-warhouse of a former Soviet military base with weapons, ammunition and IFV (infantry fighting vehicles).<br>There a lot of physical objects, many static objects and decals for greater realism, some actions &amp; effects, a huge city as background for 3D sky sistem, plus explosive barrels as hot traps. And a lot of old Soviet posters (more than 200 !!!).<br>There are special sound ambient effects (like light wind, breeze), plus special quiet music (in \"dark-ambient\"' style) from a composer.<br>And yeah -- plus two flying crows. :)<br>Also we made for this map a few multilayered destructible columns and small destructible walls.<br><br>- This is final version of the map.<br>We hardly worked on this map. And we hope for you will be exciting to play. :)<br>Have a good hunting! :)<br><br>Credits:<br>Yuriy (Gigifty) Nikos: basic geometry, some additional rooms, some city roads for 3D sky, destructible columns, rotating fans, basic lights.<br><br>Dmitry Ghervas – mentor, deep detailing of map &amp; increasing of its geometry, tactical places, evolving story, editing bot navigation, mini-map for radar, actions, decals, cables, sound ambience, effects, large city for 3D sky, destructible walls, electrical/water pipes/ventilation systems.<br><br>Other credits:<br>Dark-ambient music for background&nbsp; by Nicolas Gasparini (Myuu) - <a href=\"http://thedarkpiano.com/dark-ambient-music\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">http://thedarkpiano.com/dark-ambient-music</a><br>"
