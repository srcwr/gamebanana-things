Took half a year, but i didn't work every day on it. \r\nI just take it easy :) This map is inspired by google earth, \r\nwhen i was on google earth and saw all those 3d buildings at the manhattan island. \r\ni got an idea i'll make this in css, in Godzilla style. And see here what it has become.\r\nThere are also some sneaky places in the map. And a plane that can fly try to let it fly :P\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE \r\n------\r\ni have added HDR and a sound in the background. \r\nAlso changed the poopie brown skybox to Grassy happy rocks.\r\nAnd changed some couple things more. \r\nnow when you play the map you feel a lot happier :D\r\n"
