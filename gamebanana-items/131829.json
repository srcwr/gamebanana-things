Defend yourselves by blocking them with all sorts of obstacles, or find some high ground to fend yourselves from the zombies!\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n- 64 + 64 spawnpoints\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Optimized\r\n- Secrets\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n- The \"hole\" underneath the two-desk-room has been covered with a breakable wooden floor. Now you need to break it first. The cabinets underneath the desks are now physic props.\r\n- The underground room design has been improved significantly.\r\n- Shortcuts (ladders) up the tower have been added for balance reasons.\r\n- Zombies should find it harder, if not impossible, to jump from the tower onto the tree-platform now.\r\n- Map is now slightly brighter.\r\n- Various textures have been replaced and improved\r\n- New secrets have been added."
