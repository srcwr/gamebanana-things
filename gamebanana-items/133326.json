Thx!!\r\n\r\nThis is a multi Arena map that is a mix of Sniper, Deagle, Iceworld, GG and I added my own creation, a fire arena \r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe map takes place in a late afternoon setting and it is well lit for combat,\r\nThe Fire Arena is meant to be dark and gloomy to give it the right feel i wanted.\r\n\r\nOne problem is the entrance to the Fire Area had a stupid glitch that i cant get rid of. It looks\r\nas if you cant go down the pipe due to peices of the floor in the middle of the pipe but you can go thru \r\nit.\r\n\r\nOther than that the map is basically done!\r\nif i fix that problem i will resubmit it!\r\n\r\nENJOY!!\r\n\r\nThe map is good for gun games or just for fun!!!!\r\n\r\nMERCK"
