	"_sText": "This is one of my first maps I've made, it's a gungame texture map and is finally ready to be released. This is the newest version (v1.1) of the map with better lighting and textures. The teleporters are gone and since SIG no longer exists I removed the SIG logo and put our NxR logo instead. There are a couple other changes but since this is the first release I'm not going to use display change notes until later updates.\r\n\r\nv2 changes:\r\n\r\nRamp has been changed, it now has breakable glass segments for the ramp itself, new rail/wall with peep holes gives extra cover when going up, but be warned, you can still be shot through it.\r\n\r\nAlso, the spawn roofs now has a small L wall for extra cover."
