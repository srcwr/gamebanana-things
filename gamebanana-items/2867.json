	"_sText": "Yeah, it's true, yet another trick prefab. This one is rather simple although the bridge itself is reasonably good looking. It's just a normal rope bridge but the middle plank is tied to func_illusionary (meaning you can walk through it, so basically it looks there but solidly it's not. Kind of like a mirage.) Enjoy, and please credit me if you put this in your map.\r\n\r\n*Note* There are 2 edits that don't appear in the screenshots. \r\n1.) I lowered the rope on one side so it's not at the very top of the pole.\r\n2.) I made the first plank less steep.\r\n\r\nHere's a video I threw together, this was before the updates too.. :\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/kyt8McqGSy0&rel=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/kyt8McqGSy0&rel=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>"
