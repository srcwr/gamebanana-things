	"_sText": "This is one of my ideas i got when a friend said to me, lets have a grenade fight. \r\nWe both played on one of my other maps named fy_jwt_dust_beta3 and had some really great time just throwing grenades at each other. That's why i made this map.\r\nOn this map you will be given a grenade and a knife in the beginning, when u throw your first grenade you will just have to get another one somewhere on the map. \r\nAs you can see everywhere on the map there is grenades lying on the ground, grenade spawn points in almost all walls and there is one grenade spawn in each tower.\r\nThe special thing with V2 is that i added a pistol with 13 bullets on each teams roof."
