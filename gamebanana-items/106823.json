	"_sText": "There are two towers, with two \"houses\" under them, were the two teams spawn. There are conveyors around the map, which can take the player very quickly to the other side. Deagle is the main weapon, but there are three mp5's in the map. This map has been very popular on my clan's server, so  some weeks after I put it on my clan's server,  I decided to share it with you guys :P \r\nHave fun!"
