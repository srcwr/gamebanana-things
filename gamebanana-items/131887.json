	"_sText": "This was a map I worked on to give a slightly different aspect of gameplay to zombie mod servers. Most area's are either cadeable, good to hide, or good to fend off zombie hoards, but each one does have more then one entry or is vulnerable in some way. There are several breakable walls and floors, as well as windows and various other multiple entry ways. A code protected floodgate system for the basement areas as well as power generators where a console can be broken to shut down power to the whole complex (while enabling a few emergency lights and candles).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those lazy folk out there, I've also generated the mp5navy and dual elites as your default weapons upon spawn, so you can go directly to your spots without the delay of buying weapons."
