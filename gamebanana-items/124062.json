Enjoy the maps\r\n\r\nGG_DEADSPACE_FINAL is one of the maps not featured in the photos.. download the pack to find out what hides inside\r\n\r\nMost of these maps include hdr, custom sounds, custom skyboxes, ambient sounds, custom textures, custom models. Sprite effects, advanced geometry, displacement geometry, logic systems, level visual and sound effects, and 6 out of the 7 maps are symmetrical design GG_WUNDERTOWN is isometric"
