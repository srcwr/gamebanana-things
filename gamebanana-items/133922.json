One is on the top of bridge the othere is on the catwalk just under the bridge. I did this so the hole bridge is used. By the pitcures you can't see there is a door in the tunnel to get from the top to catwalk faster. Othere then jumping down, you can do this without killing yourself from both sides.\r\n\r\n I hope you like it . \r\n\r\nAny and all comments welcomed. :) \r\n\r\n\r\n*EDIT*\r\n\r\nThis map is now an Aim map. aim_BlownBridge\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/129218"
