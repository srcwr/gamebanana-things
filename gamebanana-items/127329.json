Feel free to ask me questions. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy submission was withheld for a day because I didn't have enough screenshots. So I added one. Its of pretty much the same place, but this time from the inside. I did this in part because I designed the other traps in a way that it looks like you can \"cheat\" them, but you can't and it would ruin the surprise the first time, and in part because it gave me a few problems. It might have something to do with the sound or skins or something, and i wanted this out by christmas, so yeah.\r\n\r\nMy new version of the map fixed some glaring holes i found. Please delete your old map.\r\n\r\n"
