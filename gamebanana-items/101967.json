	"_sText": "My friend lemons was given me a request of making a de_dust themed map.  I thought it would be ok if he gave me some stuff to work on. The guy didn’t show up for 2 days, so I was thinking, I had already made a remake of ba_jail_electric, so why can’t I do the same thing with de_dust2. It turned out to be pretty good. People who have been testing have made some comments.  - if you play it for one hour and then go back to the original de_dust2,  you feel weird in the head.  But that’s just because everything is opposite, (a hill will be a slope and a down stair will go up stairs) as you can see in the screen shots. I hope you enjoy the remake, and I will see you soon."
