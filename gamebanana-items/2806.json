	"_sText": "This is a Multi-Stop Elevator. It contains 5 Floors, or L, 1, 2, 3, and 4. I made this elevator from scratch, and it took me like a week to make. The elevator was built for Zombie Panic: Source, but I made a version for Counter Strike: Source as well. The elevator operates best in ZPS, so I would give it a shot there before you try it in CSS. In ZPS, the elevator is very smooth, as in CSS, it is choppy like.\r\n\r\nYou are required to give me credit for the elevator if you use it, I spent so much time on it!\r\n\r\n(UPDATE)\r\nKnown Issues\r\nElevator is not exactly level with the floors, I cannot resolve this problem at this time, but any help would be appreciated.  \r\nSometimes, a button inside the elevator (Usually 2) gets stuck and cannot be pushed, this is because of the anti-close I placed in the elevator, so that the elevator doors cannot close if you push the button the represents the floor that the elevator is currently at. This issue is possible to fix.\r\nIf you mash the buttons, the elevator will stop in between floors. Just don't confuse the elevator!\r\nIf you mash buttons, sometimes you will freeze the elevator opening sound. DON'T MASH.\r\nDoes not have a first priority system. (If a button is pushed first, it places that destination as first priority, then if another button is pressed, that will be the second priority.) It would be really cool, but I don't think it's possible.\r\nNOTE: If you don't like the style to it, just change the textures!\r\n\r\n*Features*\r\n5 Floors (Elevator goes to 5 floors.)\r\nAnti-Camp (Cannot get ontop or below the elevator, you will die instantly.)\r\nAnti-Close (Example: If the elevator is at 1 and you push button 1, the doors will not close.)\r\nAnti-Block (Cannot block any of the doors and elevator, you will get badly hurt or you will die.)\r\nAnti-Glitch (Cannot block the elevator or doors with objects, the object will fall through.)\r\nLight Indicators (Total of 6 light indicators, 1 for each floor, and 1 inside the elevator. It tells you where the elevator is currently at..)\r\nSmooth (It's smooth at least for Zombie Panic: Source)\r\nThank you for using it!\r\n\r\n(If you need help making a custom elevator, contact me so we can talk about it.)\r\n\r\nContact information:\r\nSteam:Sp3aker123\r\nSkype:james_bondhv\r\nE-Mail:james_bondhv@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qdIuhofiBg0&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qdIuhofiBg0&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"
