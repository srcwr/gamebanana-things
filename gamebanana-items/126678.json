So i decided to make a militia style map just to remember the old times.\r\n\r\nTherefore i took the liberty to use a original map. What i needed were a landscape and the main building  .\r\n\r\nof course i made some cool things like security cameras, epic button, disco hall and so on....\r\n\r\ni hope u like it ^_^\r\n>> Creat_1 |\r\n"
