I made this map to challenge my artistic skills. I am a very young mapper(don't call use squeakers >:( ) lol but yeah I just got into mapping and I am enjoying it. Expect more from me, I hope you like it. As I said I focused more on the looks so gameplay may not be very good but please tell me if you like it. It makes me wanna do more! :D\r\nIf you want to put it on your map! Don't need credits bro. All yours."
