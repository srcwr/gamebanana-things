	"_sText": "Before the zombie apocalypse...\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nTerrorists and Counter-Terrorists battled it out with their scouts and their knives on top of Mercy Hospital! Will the terrorists annihilate the CT's and be able to distribute the deadly zombie virus, or will the CT's be able to stop them in time?\r\n\r\n#### Features:\r\n\r\n- 60 spawns\r\n\r\n- HDR\r\n\r\n- Color correction\r\n\r\n- Rain and fog\r\n\r\n- Scouts and knives at spawn\r\n\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n\r\n- Lightning effects\r\n\r\n- Rain / thunder ambiance\r\n\r\n- Optimized\r\n\r\n- 3d skybox\r\n\r\n- Fun gameplay\r\n\r\n\r\nI made this map from scratch, inspired (obviously) by the epic \"No Mercy\" rooftop finale from L4D. No content was ported, everything you see here is from CSS (except for the custom textures I made and the skybox from Hip Shot).\r\n\r\n### I hope you enjoy playing the map as much as I enjoyed making it ;)"
