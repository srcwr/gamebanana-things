	"_sText": "This is a revision of the map knas_rocktown_css by RunE. \r\nIt was done after the Sbg. Clan asked me whether I would be able to edit the map and make a few changes, as the CTs had to many advantages.\r\nI said I could, but would want RunEâ€™s permission. I contacted him and he gave me both the permission and the ressource files, so I did not even decompile the map.\r\nMembers of the Sbg. Clan and myself met on the Sbg. Clan server and discussed the spots we wanted to change. There are a few crates added in places where the terrorists desperatly needed cover, and so on.\r\nI have to admit the map is now quite easy for the terrorists to win, especially if counter-terrorists still rely on their advantages, but the CT team can still win. In the end, it is fairer, we think.\r\n \r\nAll credit goes to RunE of course!\r\n"
