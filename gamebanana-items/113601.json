Aye\r\nmates your ships come with working cannons, m249s in the Hull, and \r\nyes you can drive the GODamn ships. 2 of the finest ships found in the Carribean, with smooth sailing nothing goes wrong.I've heard stories about the contents of that treasure. About the 4 noob weapons the noob auto rifle (sig550), the noob rifle (Awp), the noob destroyer (m249), and of course the Noob Cannon (m3). Now gents get your rifles and pilage the island  up ahead and destroy the treasure before the royal navy gets ahold of it. Good luck and good riddens."
