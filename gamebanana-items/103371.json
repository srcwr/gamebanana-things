	"_sText": "<b>DE_OILRIG07</b> by Patzilla / fenceareus (released July 2010)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The small map of island-type with the night and rainy atmosphere, reconstructed an oil-extracting platform in coastal waters of Somewhere. The terrorists, who came here by a motor boat, try to reach or Data Storage at the Level 2, or a Manager Office at the Level 6. And arrived by helicopter Special Forces will try them to stop...\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Despite the Beta status the map looks quite finished (except for absented mini-map on radar) and absolutely playable. In comparison with the previous version (de_oilrig06) new models and textures are added, the space of map was expanded dramaticaly, also some errors are corrected - in the same map and in the Navigation Mesh for Bots. By the way, the Bots play here adequately... more or less ;-)<br>\r\n<br>Play and Enjoy! Also Great Thanks to Patzilla for his Good Work."
