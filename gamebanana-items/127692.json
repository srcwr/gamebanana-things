	"_sText": "A mini game map where you spawn in a fish tank and the water rises and you either have to finish off the enemy fast or eventually you will need to go up to the top for air where everyone is battling for a tiny room where they can breath. Built it in a day took a bit of time, its set up for 16v16 so larger mini game servers can run it to. There is a working water mine in the middle you can shoot it to make it blow up or you can shoot at the chain to make it rise up (sometimes into the room) then blow up any campers up there :) either way its fun to mess with. Prefab credit to Killo$ity for part of the chain used. Please comment and rate the map, so I know if I should release more of these abnormal maps in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks to Borixon for a custom texture and help."
