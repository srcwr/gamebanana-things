The map is based on my house, but it is not that small, look at the screenshots. \r\n\r\nI put a few hours making this, so I'd be happy if you left a comment of what you think.\r\n\r\nIf you find any glitches/bugs, plz post a comment here or PM me.\r\n\r\nRecommanded players: 4 on each team.\r\n\r\nVID: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yNQs_kWeU6k\r\n\r\naim/dev style."
