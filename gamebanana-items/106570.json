	"_sText": "Ok, this is my fourth map and for sure my best of the four! It took less than a day to make because it is small but even with bots its really great fun! It is loaded with features including:\r\n\r\n-Two sniper towers\r\n-Underground tunnel system\r\n-Custom lighting\r\n-Slits in the walls of the spawn rooms\r\n-A big garden in the middle\r\n-Scouts and a shotgun can be found in the map\r\n-Buy zones\r\n-20 spawns for each team\r\n-Cs_militia skybox\r\n-Nav file\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: It will most likely give you a message when you play this map saying that the nav file was created on a different version of the map! This is fine, it is because I created the nav file on my second to last test of the map. On my last edit, I just moved a tree and added some more lights, so the bots should move fine. But, if it gets annoying just type nav_analyze in console and wait..."
