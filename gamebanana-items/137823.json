He somehow gained access to the source engine a year before it was released to the general public. My suspicions is that he is an ex-valve employee.&nbsp;<br><br>Pickles' final words to the TF2 community before releasing this map were as follows:&nbsp;<span class=\"RedColor\">Welcome to surf_kaboom! After 12 years in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait.</span><br><br>When I was porting it, my computer couldn't handle the stress of such a powerful and beautifully detailed map that I had a few blue screens during the process. I really felt like I was tampering with God's work here.&nbsp;Legend has it Pickles created this masterpiece only using the <span class=\"GreenColor\">carve tool</span>.&nbsp;<br><br>Download at your own risk."
