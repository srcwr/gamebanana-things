	"_sText": "This map is based on Super Smash Bros. Onett stage. It is not a complete look-alike, but it is close enough.\r\n\r\nThe map features a small town similar to the one in the Onett stage from Super Smash Bros. There are many cool houses, nice outdoor environment, cars driving nuts and some secret areas.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n- Custom textures made by me, made to look as much like the original stage as possible.\r\n\r\n- Cars driving nuts through the town, damaging, boosting and even killing players.\r\n\r\n- Some small secret areas/places for the player to discover.\r\n\r\n- Awsome ingame music and sounds from the original stage.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, Lickwim."
