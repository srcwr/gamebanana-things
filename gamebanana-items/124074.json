Big enough to\r\nhave plenty of fun with 12 players, small enough for 2 to get into\r\ntense battles.  Mainly designed to have an industrial feel to it,\r\nprop limit low to maintain good FPS.  Very exciting map to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeagleCup_Map2\r\n\r\nMax Players: 12\r\nBuild Time: 2.5 hours\r\nCompile Time: 1 minute, 34 seconds\r\nAverage FPS: 182\r\nde_dust2 Average FPS: 92\r\n\r\nAfter doing a rather industrial based map, it only seemed natural to\r\nmake one with a more natural feel to it.  The size is larger than\r\nthe first map and has a slightly higher level of detail (mainly from\r\nthe displacements), but the FPS don't suffer too much.  Long range\r\naccuracy and use of cover will win this map.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeagleCup_Map3\r\n\r\nMax Players: 12\r\nBuild Time: 8 hours\r\nCompile TIme: 2 minutes, 58 seconds\r\nAverage FPS: 135\r\nde_dust2 Average FPS: 92\r\n\r\nAs this was the third map, one that was only meant to be played in\r\ncase of a draw between the other two maps, meant I could do something\r\na little different.  Instead of focusing entirly on a single indoor\r\narea, or an entire outdoor area, I decided to include both.  This\r\nalso meant the map had a combination fo close-quarters action and\r\nsome longer range oppertunities.  This map also uses the 3D skybox.\r\n\r\n</div>"
