	"_sText": "This is the first beta version of Goodfellas Arena X.\r\n\r\nThere are no known bugs but if any are found please post here or e-mail me at deal@thehightower.net.\r\n\r\nOn top of the roofs walk off the side and you will be teleported to the adjacent rooftop. The two rooftops not by spawns also have teleports at their rear. To get to the balconies from the bottom walk into the x on the botton of the map.\r\n\r\nAll teleports have been optimized so that if someone stands on the target of the teleport there is 80% less chance players will be teleported into each other.\r\n\r\nHas a custom soundscape.\r\n\r\nThe sky box texture was not made by me but by hipshot (www.zfight.com).\r\n\r\nThe beta2 version is already in the works so please post comments and ideas as they may make it into the map."
