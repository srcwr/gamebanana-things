The oldest breakfloor clan known. The things that have changed are the textures, and details. The ''break the floor'' shoutout is now revised. Same counts for the textures and the pit at the bottom. There is now a van to avoid players to camp from down below when they somehow survive the drop.\r\n\r\nClimbing over the wall is still possible.\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
