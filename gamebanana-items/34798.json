I hope that they will punish all poachers shooting a defenseless seagulls! :D</p><p>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br></p>\r\n<p>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/75868\">same map</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Play and Enjoy!
