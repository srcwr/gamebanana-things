You can find me on LMRT server, I'm in their clan, which is a zombie mod clan so that's mostly why I made it. There are many spots on the map, and two secret areas. I hope you folks will enjoy play it, so I can be proud, hehe.\r\nComments and suggestions are always welcome!\r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks to the people who answered the questions I had, Kev_Boy and some members of the LMRT clan."
