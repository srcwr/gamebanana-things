	"_sText": "Hello everyone .. After a long time I made a remake of my famous jail map underfoot. Is it incorporated many new features such as texture change and the creation of full HDR compilation. Next, I added a secret room at the entrance to which it adds 666 to your score and play a little faster song :-) (do not think that to get it so easily ..). I have also added two passes in a cell to another cell, making it harder to detect on CT who has a gun and who does not :-) and many other interesting things such as a shaft, which must be broken rib after rib. On this map I had mainly depend for demanding players that they liked more than the previous, slightly less lagging version :-). If you find an error in my map, write me a message and I'll definitely fix it."
