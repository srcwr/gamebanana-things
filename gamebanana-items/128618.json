Each map is based on skill of some sort, BHOP, SURF, Shooting etc. There are 64 spawns and the map has lighting with colours to create ambience. There are some custom textures in some map and some maps there are none. There are 3 musics that are chosen randomly at the start of a minigame. \r\n\r\n<B>The minigames are:</B>\r\n\r\n<B>LunarKirby</B>\r\nClimb\r\nDeathrun\r\nRace\r\nSlide\r\nSurf\r\n\r\n<B>Whazaaaaa</B>\r\nAwpBattle\r\nBhop\r\nIceSkate\r\nKnifeFight\r\nScoutBattle\r\n\r\n<B>Authors Comment</B>\r\nWhen we first started the map <B>[August 2009]</B> we were sure that we could make this and we did eventually, one thing we did not expect was it to take this long.......\r\nAfter one Year we finally managed to finish the map, the delay was not because of difficulty but with laziness.. yes, we are both very very lazy mappers. We worked on the map then we stopped then we worked on it again, alot of times. The main key that kept us going was the support of people, not really support, they kind of forced us to map.\r\nSo this map took 1 year for us to make, and man we are so glad. -.-\r\n\r\nDuring the development of this map we ran into a problem, <B>MAX_PLANE</B>, yes our map had to many brush faces. The original map began with 10 maps like today, some odd minigames. Then one day I decided to add more minigames and the total went to 18. We finished all 18 maps compiled it all together and boom, we hit the error. So we made a plan to Split the map into two, one map with skill minigames and the other with fun minigames, named.\r\n\r\nMG_SG_ALLINONE_SKILL\r\nAnd\r\nMG_SG_ALLINONE_FUN\r\n\r\nSo we did that and here we are the release if the first Half, SKILL.\r\nWe'll release the other half next time, proberly taking another 1 or 2 years.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading our map [if you do...]\r\nAnd hey dood, i know, <B>tl;dr</B>.\r\n\r\n<B>Map Properties</B>\r\n<B>Name:</B> MG_SG_ALLINONE_SKILL\r\n<B>Type:</B> MG - Multimap / All-In-One\r\n<B>Size:</B> 45Mb\r\n<B>Content:</B> \r\n10 Minigames\r\nCustom Textures\r\nMusic\r\nAwesome Themes and designs\r\n\r\n<Big><Big><Big>PLEASE DOWNLOAD\r\nPLEASE PLAY\r\nPLEASE COMMENT</Big></Big></Big>\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<B>MG_SG_ALINONE_SKILL_V2</B>\r\n<B>Made by</B>\r\n[SG] LunarKirby\r\n[SG-A] Whazaaaaa\r\n<B>www.SteamGamers.com</B>\r\n<B>Minigame IP:</B> 72.26.196.164:27015\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<B><Big>THIS MAP TOOK 1 YEAR OMFG</Big></B>"
