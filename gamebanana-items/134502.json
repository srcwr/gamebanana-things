Spawns are opposite, different ways of approaching the enemy. Several smaller building surround it. You must jump roof to roof to reach the top. The two buildings by the spawn have a camping spot. I decided to put some detail into this map with a border at the bottom of all the buildings and  a noticeable pipe running the outside of the buildings.\r\n---------\r\nother: 32 slot, medium size."
