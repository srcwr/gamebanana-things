This map is really one of my favorites- ever. My friend ChaosFury, the maker of the other ZombieChaos maps, made the original months ago. It was, without a doubt, one of the best laid out maps I had ever played. After months of new releases I asked him if I could remake it. After a month and 1/2 I finally finished it and I consider it to be one of the best zombiemod maps out there.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone enjoys this map, more than I already do. Special thanks to ChaosFury, whom without there would be no map. And also to the community at www.aceserv.net for beta testing it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
