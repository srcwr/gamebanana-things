	"_sText": "This map is a small map built for 16 players or less but supports up to 32. This map was made for players that want a good detailed map without using up all your resources.  \r\n\r\nThe map features 2 sides of columns to provide cover but also to provide advantage points while also allowing the die hards rush in by running straight into the pool.  The theme of the map started out with like a matrix theme but just grew more and more ambient as I worked on it.  I think it turned out very well and is one of my best detailed maps so far.  Hope ya enjoy it and please take the time to give some feedback.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBlade2021\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy maps and projects and more screenshots can be found at 2021Productions.com  I'd like to give my sincere thanks to the clan members of MurderNetworks for helping me with suggestions and testing.
