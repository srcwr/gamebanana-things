Make the best looking Machine Map with also a good gameplay.\r\nWe think we did a great job but at the end it´s up to you to decide if the mission is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWell here are some informations about the map.\r\n\r\nWe added:\r\n\r\nRadar Overview\r\nRandom Weapon Spawner\r\nUnique Pre, and secret rooms \r\nOf course a lot of deteils\r\nSome changes to the basic layout most machine maps have.\r\n\r\nSorry for the bad Screenshots, they are taken without antialaising and with middel Picture Quality, so they don´t show the real look of the map.\r\n\r\na small video that shows all secrets of our new map surf_megamachine, not nice but rarely xD\r\n\r\n<object width=\"320\" height=\"205\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/iLJZbYqS1X4?fs=1&amp;hl=de_DE&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/iLJZbYqS1X4?fs=1&amp;hl=de_DE&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"320\" height=\"205\"></embed></object>"
