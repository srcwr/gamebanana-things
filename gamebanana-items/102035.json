Is this a map that you like and look play able?\r\n2. Idea's to what i can put in.\r\n3. Some one that's good in design and lightning in Source SDK\r\n\r\nPleas notice also:\r\n- This map is Decompile protected.\r\n- All the roof's are illusion's so you are able to throw nade's and stuff like that right through it.\r\n- The 2 closed door's on right side for T' spawn will open on E press and throwing nades. So you are able to cast nades on the other side.\r\n\r\nThat's all.\r\n\r\nSo i will watch this map's feedback each day from now on and hope for something that i can use.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\nBlack Perl\r\n"
