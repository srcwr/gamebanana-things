But the CTS can be 32! The terrorist has an M3,\r\n a Deagle, a knife and a costume ... And terrorists, for each player CT, an extra 170HP,\r\n and the CTS can buy weapons, and they first $ 10,000 ...\r\n\r\n/! \\ You need Mani Admin Plugin for orders (ma_give, and so on ...)\r\n\r\nENJOY!\r\n\r\nPS: I'm sorry, my English is not perfect ... ^ ^ '\r\n\r\n\r\n"
