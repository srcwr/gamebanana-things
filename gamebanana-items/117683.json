	"_sText": "This map contains a couple of changes to one of my other maps, dm_scoutingouting, that provide a completely different gaming experience.\r\n\r\n1. A spawn house was added for each team, with a team-specific buy zone, giving the newly-spawned protection and choice as to what gun to use.\r\n\r\n2. The middle stone wall was moved so as to give the spawned protection while coming out of their spawn house.\r\n\r\n3. A bridge was added to bridge the gap between the two sides.\r\n\r\n"
