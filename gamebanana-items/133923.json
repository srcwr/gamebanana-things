Original MiP by Hamster, everything else done by me. I put a lot of effort into texturing this map, and created a custom 3d skybox. This map runs smoothly with 12-18 players, but has 24 player spawns and is still good to play on with any number of players.\r\n\r\nA buyzone is included for testing purposes, as most GG servers turn buyzones off.\r\n\r\nGive me some feedback. I'll take pretty much any good suggestions. Tell me of any bugs, as there are none known at this time. This map is still Alpha, so cut it some slack. ;P\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The only known bug is that sometimes players will spawn in each-other. This will be fixed in the next version. I suggest you just wiggle your way out, players usually aren't stuck permanently.\r\n\r\nAlso, VIDEO!\r\n<object width=\"300\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/n2NBUEZ-NwY&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/n2NBUEZ-NwY&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"
