Friendly for mid- and low-range fightings.\r\n\r\n Overview, Radar and some other custom stuff are included in BSP-file. NOTE: NAV-file for Bots are included too, but it seems not hand-tuned (imho).\r\n\r\n Map was taking 2-nd Place in first official Mappingbase.de CS:S Mappingcontest (supported by BFHosting.com and ESL), which has ended October 2011.\r\n Results of Competition: _http://mappingbase.de/content/151-Contest-Ergebnisse_\r\n\r\n Map was once released Mart 2012 as a part of Mappingbase CS:S Mappingcontest Mappack 1 (Full Version).\r\n Mappack download page: _http://mappingbase.de/content/255-Mappingbase-Mappack_\r\n Direct download link: _http://download.gc-gaming.de/bashor/mappingbase/css_maps/Contest_2011_MB_Mappack.zip_\r\n\r\n Thanks for your viewings and feedbacks. Good Frags and Enjoy!\r\n\r\n P.S. Sorry my English, I am from Russia ;-)"
