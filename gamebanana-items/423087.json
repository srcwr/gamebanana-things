This map however was supposed to be a remake of cs_estate or known as cs_mansion. The original vmf was filled with missing assets and dev blocks, so I did a quick and hacky job of restoring this, I might update this later on to be more refined.<br><br></b><div class=\"bb_h1 SelectedElement\"><span class=\"RedColor\">KNOWN ISSUES:</span></div><br>- Few Missing Decals<br><br><div class=\"bb_h1\"><span class=\"GreenColor\">WHAT I ADDED:</span></div><br>- Textures<br>- Soundscapes<br>- Few Ladders<br>- AI Nodes<br>- Playerclip<br>- Cubemaps"
