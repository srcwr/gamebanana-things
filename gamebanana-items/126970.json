I've been working and testing this map all day and night.\r\nThere are  traps:\r\n\r\n1# Container which fills with molten metal\r\n2# Crushing blocks on a conveyor belt\r\n3# Metal bucket of molten metal (Jump)\r\n4# Jump across pit\r\n5# Locking chamber which fills with molten metal\r\n6# Platforms, you die if you hit the top\r\n7# Falling metal bucket\r\n8# Broken gas pipes\r\n9# Breaking catwalk grids\r\n10# Fan which blows off windows\r\n11# Jump over buckets filled with molten metal (avoid fans)\r\n12# Jump over water pit\r\n13# Conveyor belts which lead to a pit of molten metal\r\n14# Exploding gas container\r\n15# Step through the right port or fall down to a pit of molten metal\r\n16# Huge platform which goes down a pit of molten metal\r\n\r\nThe traps are very interesting, and some of them are original in my opinion.\r\nGo give the map a try!\r\n\r\n+40 CT spawnpoints\r\n3 T spawnpoints\r\nNo minigames, you go straight to kill the killers\r\nFeaturing a kickass metal bucket model which has an metal pouring animation with molten metal liquid."
