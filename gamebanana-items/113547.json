THIS MAP IS RESTRICED FOR ANY\r\nCHANGES OR EXTENSIONS IF YOU DO NOT ASK ME FIRST.\r\nEMAIL: mattsplace@sbcglobal.net WEBSITE: www.tangodelta.org\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorist: Pretend this is a game of paintball, but you have\r\nonly one life. Don't waste it, and take tactics to eliminate the\r\nopposing team. Stay in groups, and plan your attack carefully.\r\nYou should come out with a victory.\r\n\r\nTerrorist: Eliminate the opposing team, and you shall go on to\r\nbe the most recognized paintballer team in the world. Watch your backs\r\nand make sure you don't get caught up in the middle of a firefight.\r\nUse smoke grenades to cover yourself while moving.\r\n\r\nTips and Advice: Take the water level (level 1) to get around to\r\nthe other side quicker. Shoot people you see above the grates, and\r\nsmoke areas that are needed. Have half of your people stay back,\r\nand the other half rush spread out. Make sure you have all corners\r\ncovered, and this shall be an easy victory.\r\n\r\n-=(TD)=- Drz. Rootbeerz restricted map, Tango Delta©®"
