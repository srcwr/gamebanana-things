	"_sText": "This took me a while to get down right the first time. The .vmf has a mathcounter, 2 gate textures, a padlock, and a trigger. This is designed so when you shoot the padlock then the gates open up upon touching the trigger. Technically you can put the padlock anywhere and it will work the same, but I have found that the center of the 2 doors just feels right, ;p. Anyways if you do ever use this then please be sure to credit me. :)\r\n\r\nA good example of this work is used <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/71294\">here</a> where I have used it 3 times.
