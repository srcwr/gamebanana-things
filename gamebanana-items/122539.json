	"_sText": "Hey, this is an addictive map by myself and Cleavage from the Surfers-United clan. It's quite hard, especially the boost on the second platform, but easy to get used to. It's quite big, so you should be playing for a good while, but also it's very interesting as it has switches that can blow up people at spawn towards the end of the second room with a camera.\r\n\r\nThere is a grenade-arena as well with a 'crusher' switch which is very very cool, that crushes people behind the glass... as it's the only way to get to the weapons and out of the grenade arena (unless you're killed)\r\n\r\nHave Fun!\r\n\r\n- Steve"
