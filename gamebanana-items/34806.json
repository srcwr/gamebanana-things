It's a totally created from scratch and manually optimized (hand-tuned) .nav-file because in original map author's archive was included simple auto-gen.<br><br>More than 70% of all areas were created manually because during an auto-generation processing the majority of them were constructed incorrectly.<br><br>Well... bots have opportunity to use all walkable ways and they surely move according to all areas of the map. After their visit the plant obviously will need capital repairs! :D<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map author embedded in .bsp-file and available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/115244\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also spend minute of the time to share with other about your impressions of playing with bots ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nNick_Ed90 (for fine designed and high detailed industrial-themed map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Happy Frags and Good Luck!<br>\r\n<br>"
