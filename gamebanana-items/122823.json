	"_sText": "I took surf_rr_reloaded_light and replaced the spawn, deagle area, the noob, and the jail with the ones from surf_rebel_resistance_final2.  All of the parts from final2 were retextured to fit the texture scheme of reloaded_light.  I also made some minor changes like making the fall from spawn send you to jail and made a little more room in the downwards zigzag.  The lasers work, but you're going to have to figure out how :)"
