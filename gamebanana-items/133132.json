The job was to made a zm_ map in Prison style. \r\nThere are fewer hiding spots then in other maps, so the humans must work together to survive. I think the map would be a better cs_map xD.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- 60 Spawnpoints\r\n- 1 micro secret (xD)\r\n- 1 medium secret\r\n- a lot of differnt rooms\r\n- no ultimate camper spot (like ventilation shaft)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo... I hope you enjoy my work and maybe some of you can help me to fix some bugs, which I can't fix (lol).\r\nlike the lightbug in the \"registration room\"\r\n\r\nPls rate & subscribe\r\n\r\n\r\n- Zerberus - "
