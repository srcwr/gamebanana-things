	"_sText": "Well... after V1 was a complete flop (much too large for GG, also I put it in the wrong section on FPSBanana and got it trashed.. OOPSIE DAISY), I created V2.\r\n\r\nV1 had a large basement (hence the name, it amde it a bomb shelter) which juust provided too many camping spots for GG... so I deleted the basement and turned it into a \"Rage Kage\" (a large room used for knifing only.... no rules.. gangbanging allowed... yo ucan find one on BaggedArena, which is also made by me (:D ) as well as Cray_Shotty_Akcolt (made by Crayola)... they're good fun). The switch in the main room turns the lights off in the cabin...... but they can be turned back on... so no worries.\r\n\r\nAnyway. I hope this one is more enjoyed that Version 1 was.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The skybox texture is not made by me.. but infact its made by Hazel Whorley."
