	"_sText": "A big dark cold facility...good if you have a bit of patience..may seem like a maze to new people at first...you must find your weapons or rush to the middle where u can turn the lights on...though it takes 30 second for the middle doors to open..so if you rush there you may get shot from someone who had went to get a gun...in the middle 1 of the button turns on the lights for the whole building and one raises all the walls of the map to shoot anything thats lost or stuck or afk in spawn..map is pitch black so you will need a flash light...has a song from halflife 1 in it to add to creepyness...goodluck hope you like."
