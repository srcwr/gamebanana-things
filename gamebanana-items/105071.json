Most areas are connected by teleports.\r\n\r\nI created all the custom textures and custom skybox (just so there is no credit confusion).\r\n\r\n<font color=#0090FF>Thanks to the members of my studio who helped my with some issues and testing.</font>\r\n\r\n<font color=#FF0000>NOTICE:</font> I added a nav file only to realize that bots are too stupid to use the teleports.  So it's best not to use bots with the map.  Also at ct spawn use the pop machine to unlock the door.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the map."
