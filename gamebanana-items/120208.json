	"_sText": "This is the probably fairly well-known map aim_ag_texture2, which I have editted to add lots of \"traps\", for example an avalanche of rocks, a falling bridge, two walls that crush you if you stand between, poisonous gas...\r\nAll of these traps are activated by shooting at the several targets around the map. Some other traps include: low gravity for 15 seconds, darkness for 15 seconds, a cannon that shooots an enormous cannon ball, a deathly laser beam, multiple explosions etc.\r\nHave fun!! "
