I really liked the original maps by Adam Hawkins (flfpacman,flfmspacman,flfpacmanjr) and B4K73R1U5/Murd3rd0ll (cspacman), so I think this is a decent remake.\r\n<br>Two different versions of the map are included mg_pacman &amp; mg_mspacman.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Gameplay: The ct's (pacmen) have to bring all the hostages (power pellets) into the middle of the map whilst the t's (ghosts) have to stop them.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Have fun."
