	"_sText": "A hosties map based in the sky, a lot of this maps theme came from the Cairo Arcology from Deus Ex 2 Invisible War. Getting outside of this map has been tried and tested and you can't get out unless you noclip. There is a secret way to get to on top of the entire map via a hidden teleport and only one(1) player can go up there and pick up a few weapons.\r\n\r\n2 versions of gun toss, a normal version and a bucket version with no rules, so make you own on the fly.\r\n\r\nArena floating in the middle for knife and chicken fights.\r\n\r\nShot for shot opposite of the gun toss areas. \r\n\r\n4 jail cells located near a one-way wall next to the T spawn.\r\n\r\nm4's located in front of CT spawn, well away from T's, but still a danger if they aren't watched.\r\n\r\nThis map sponsored by intox. Gaming, visit us at intoxgaming.com!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n**UPDATED FILE WITH v3, SOME MINOR GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENTS, CLIPPING ERRORS FIXED, REMOVED m4's FROM CT SPAWN. "
