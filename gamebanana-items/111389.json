	"_sText": "This is a map based on the Armory from Metal Gear Solid 1.  Due to my inability to make custom textures, I have made this a \"VR\" map for simplification.  There are 6 people on each team.  Essentially this is an FY map, but since there are many hiding places, terrorists can plant the bomb to make the round end more smoothly.  \r\n\r\nThere are 6 rooms.  All the doors are facing south.  In the upper left room, there is an autosniper.  In the upper middle room, there are FAMAS and one machinegun.  In the upper right room, there are 2 shotguns.  In the lower left room, there is an MP5 and LOTS of grenades.  In the lower middle room, there are various pistols.  In the lower right room, there are FAMAS.  The Ts get the advantage of being able to secure weapons first, so the CTs get some flashes to prevent fast rushing.  There are also pits that cause automatic deaths, just like in MGS1.  \r\n\r\nThis map has some lighting, but mp_flashlight 1 should be turned on.  There is a buyzone in the middle of the map.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a message if you have any comments or criticism."
