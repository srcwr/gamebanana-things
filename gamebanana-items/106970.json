	"_sText": "The map has a very exciting structure. With teleports, different height level, and many variables, it is very funny to play. It has some colors, and it has three basic texture. I called it deathroom, because my inspiration was the Half-Life 2: DM map \"dm_killbox\". I love this map. Many good sniper spots, many ways to hide from the sniper spots, some hidden ways and secrets.\r\nIt works as a GunGame map, a FY, Aim, skill-training, combat, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are going to host you map on your server, I would love to play this map online with gamers from all over the world!\r\n\r\nENJ0y!"
