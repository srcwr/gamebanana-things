	"_sText": "Its just a small fun map i made, there are 2 buttons on each side one to make the glass go up and down. You start with a knife and a nade, and you can get on the side of the map by standing on the glass and pressing the button.\r\n\r\nIts just a fun map so don't rate it down because you think its \"crap\" if you play it on a server its actually fun, Uberkirsche, --Alex-- and Evilclown were playing the map with me on a server and they influenced me to release it on here because they said its fun and thats what maps are about so here it is. Please comment and suggest any changes i should make or things to add."
