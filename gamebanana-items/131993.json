Includes barricade, holdout and jump spots. Don't change the content of the map without my knowledge. If you want some changes to the map ask me and I will do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess of thought: I wanted some small map with limited number of reliable spots in order to force teamplay and have more zombies and more action. I also wanted the map to be some kind of underground but I couldn't decide on how to start. So I used one of HL2 maps as the base. To keep the map small i restricted myself to part of the original map. Eventually I saw some potential in the rest of map so I decide not to delete it. However, the full map will only be available randomly.\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\nif you use this map on your server please contact me, so I can show you how stuff works + do changes to map if necessary. I can also help in testing your ZOMBIE MOD and ZOMBIE ESCAPE maps"
