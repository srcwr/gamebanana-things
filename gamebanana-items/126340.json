Try to take advantage of this!\n\nThere are 8 levels :\n\n1- Textures from thc_gold ( No ScreenShots )\n2- Woods\n3- Rocks ( Go up and up )\n4- Dev. textures ( No ScreenShots )\n5- Bricks and Sand\n6- Concrete\n7- Dark with blue lights ! ( Bhop on lights )\n8- Metal with White \n\nAlso there's a room for begginers ( to practise/learn bhop )\n\nBeta version was tested by Blacky ( A bug was found but it has already been fixed in this version )\n\nIf you finish you'll hear a \"HOLYSHIT\" then a little music and you'll be able to get a jet bag or a scout with a smile :)\n\nNo bonus.\n\nThe map supports 18 terrorists.\n\nThere are â€œoptionalâ€ music at all levels ( Its starts soundless but you can start it if you want to).\n\nI hope you enjoy it and improove your skills with those hard levels!\n\nPlease leave a comment, because i wanna know what's your opinion about the map!\nYou can also give me any suggestion or something ( Im not planning on doing another version but....who knows.. )\n\nIf you cannot download from gamebanana please use one of these links:    \nhttp://www.sendspace.com/file/f3m9ix\nhttp://rapidshare.com/files/446056997/bhop_whipz.rar\nhttp://filebeam.com/80f5ecbe8552419f3919ab7a29bf97e5\n\n\nAnd also check my previous production: Bhop_resistance_v3b:\nhttp://www.gamebanana.com/maps/153520\n\nTill next time !\n\n~~~~~~~STAY~~~~~~~~"
