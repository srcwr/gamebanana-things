	"_sText": "This map is my favorite map of all time. i worked very hard to make this map perfect. it is good for both gg and dm gg because the spauns are protected so spaun killing is a definate no. there are 3 portals in the map that take you to various spots. one (my fav) goes to the top of the map for a GREAT sniping area. there are 2 launchers that will launch u across the map. but make sure u land in the water. a land landing could be pretty painful everything is made out of stones. one bad thing is that bots DO NOT play well since they suck in water, dont use the portals and are retards with doors so for the best gameplay dont use bots.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of the map from Youtube.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMF6mXIz9fI\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UMF6mXIz9fI\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UMF6mXIz9fI\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nthe quality of the video is pretty poor and does not show the true beauty of the map.\r\n\r\nplease let me know of the server you put it on so i can come by and play it. also if u stop by our server we will play this map so u can test it out for your server if u want. \r\n\r\n8.10.162.115:27015"
