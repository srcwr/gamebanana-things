	"_sText": "**fy _ coldsnap**\r\n==================\r\nThis is a fast phased map and fun map.\r\nI started this map with just DEV textures. Messing around abit. The map was turning out pretty nice after a while. I knew people ussualy don't like dev textures (orange/grey), so I decided to add real textures. What started as just a small fun map grown out into a detailed \r\nmap. Which took me quite some time.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n==================\r\n- HDR (Tonemap Controller used)\r\n- Soundscape (Indoors and Outdoors)\r\n- 3d skybox\r\n- Detail\r\n- 64 spawn points\r\n\r\nFIXED\r\n------------------\r\n**I've updated the map. No purple/black checkerboard should accur anymore.**\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n==================\r\nTo install, unpack the .rar file to:\r\n\r\n\"Steam\\steamapps\\USERNAME\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\"\r\n\r\nComment & Rate\r\n==================  \r\nPlease give constructive feedback and rate.\r\nAlso, if you found any bugs, tell them in a comment or personal message. I'll try to fix them when I have time.\r\n\r\nHave Fun !"
