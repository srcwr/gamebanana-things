	"_sText": "An open zombie map with a bunch of small huts which you can hide in, theres also a pyramid which is useful if you want to put your back to a closed space and watch the door with your team mates to keep out those pesky zombie critters! zombies may have it tough in this map if the humans gang up on them from the hiding spots, but if anybody leaves the safety of a hut, pyramid or tower, they'll be easy targets, the key to this map is using teamwork to keep bombarding the enemy faction. It is a night tim map as well to make it even CREEPIER!!! just kidding, i just wanted to play around with the skybox and the light levels. This is the second zm_ map i have uploaded, and the first is MUCH better if you'd care to check it out =)\r\n\r\nplease leave comments with suggestions as i am planning on working on this map more through the ages to make it better.\r\n\r\nalso, if youd like to request a map, you can add me on steam or shoot me a mail"
