This map was a little rushed to get it done before Christmas, but it turned out alright.<br><br>There are two bonuses both of which are in the same room. The one on the bottom is a kz bonus for my friend sputnik. The bonus on top is just a simple strafe bonus.<br><br><br>There was a bug where the map would force&nbsp;sv_airaccelerate to 150 from my surf prefab. If you have this problem you can re-download it from the alternative link. If you don't have this problem then don't worry about it<br><br>"
