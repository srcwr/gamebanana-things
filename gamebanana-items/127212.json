	"_sText": "Deathrun Steam Works is basicaly seventh sense, except it looks a whole lot better, it has been made fairer, all the bugs (that i know of) have been fixed and better sounds have been added.\r\n\r\nDeathrun Steam Works is a very balanced map, good for all skills of death runners. The map has 155 spawn points (no idea why I didn’t stop at 64). It is based in an abstract metal tunnelling system with a lot of wood.\r\n\r\nHere are the traps in the DeathRun:\r\n\r\n1. Reverse break floor\r\n2. Fire platform\r\n3. Double crusher arms\r\n4. Fan hall\r\n5. Deadly steam jets\r\n6. Floor drop\r\n7. Electric wire\r\n8. Giant hammer\r\n9. Floor smackers\r\n10. Gear grinder\r\n11. Flying barrels\r\n12. Spinning floor thingys\r\n13. Laser crusher\r\n14. Exploding barrel jump (no terrorist)\r\n15. Spinning gear, wall trap\r\n16. Good ol’ crusher\r\n\r\nThe Mini-Games at the end of my map include:\r\n\r\n1. Deadly saw blade cannon knife arena\r\n2. Easy bunny hop\r\n3. Duck shootout, fairground style!\r\n\r\nThe map also includes:\r\n\r\n1. A giant 7\r\n2. A spiral grenade\r\n3. A smoke grenade\r\n4. And a secret ending\r\n\r\nThe map also has all the Anti-AFK feature needed to keep the game running smoothly which means that an admin doesn’t always have to be present to stop those annoying AFK people."
