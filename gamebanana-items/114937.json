Free scouts for all aswell, just incase awps are banned, but there is plenty of cover for someone with a rifle to, which is great. So check out my map and tell me what u think.\r\n\r\n//**HOW TO INSTALL**\r\nExtract to C:\\Program Files\\Steam(OR VALVE)\\steamapps\\UR ADDY\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n//**CREATED BY ASHLEY WILSON (AKA Burnin' Ash)**\r\n\r\n//**Dont Foret to vote**\r\n "
