	"_sText": "This map was made by me Pwn3r1001 with some influence from surf_matrix_v8 because of the secret areas and portals. If you think this map is all about suicidal surfing dodging lasers, ducking gun fire, speeding through portals of fiery rings well your right it does have that. But this is mostly about finding secrets in the map that lead you to places allowing you to have an advantage such as seeing the enemy without them seeing you. If you try to surf the map and quickly get to an obvious location with water and guns and a teleportal than you are most likely missing a lot of areas you can go to. Anyways this map is more than you think, and yes looks can be deceiving. Have fun and expect to see it on my server soon"
