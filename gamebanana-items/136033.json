I'm currently working on adding more things to it such as bridges and expanding it adding more structures and such. there are some problems with how the blocks are aligned but i will fix those in future releases.\r\n\r\nIt has a pit of death in the middle of the map were it looks like water but if you fall in you slowly die and it has 2 forts near the top of the map and multiple ways of getting around like ramps and ladders.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace in your C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\yoursteamname\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps"
