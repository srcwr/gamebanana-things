That's why it isn't as good as my newest maps but I decided to distribute this map more because it's still quite good.\r\n\r\nTerrorists and counter-terrorists have came by a small river to the old watermill.\r\nTerrorists have to blow up the old watermill.\r\nCounter-terrorists have to prevent them.\r\nAnd try to find my little easter-egg and that isn't that guy in the truck. :P\r\n\r\nThanks to Syntax Terror for creating the bot-file and to iwannamap.com for great help with mapping."
