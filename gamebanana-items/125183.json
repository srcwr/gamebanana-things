	"_sText": "FYI: The difficulty comes in running the map, rather than each individual level.<br><br>The CSS Bhop port of the infamous quake 3 DeFRaG map \"<b>Hangtime 2</b>\" by NaturalSpringWater (NSW). Although the original hangtime took me like a month to port and ended up not being very good, this one only took a week, and I paid extra special attention to making it look and feel very good, even if the gameplay is a little awkward.<br><br>Every single level is possible, some are just very difficult while others are just a little awkward. I have completed each myself, even if it took me like 10 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Difficulty: Hard - Insane<br>Difficulty (Casual Runs): Medium - Hard<br>Length: Long - 60 levels in total<br>Est. Run Time: 5 - 10 mins<br><br>Hopefully it ends up as good as I think it might.<br><br><b class=\"SelectedElement\">EDIT: It has come to my attention that somebody has edited this map and republished it somewhere with the same name (hangtime2_fix). I'm personally fine with people editing my maps; they've been ported to gmod by some russian guys before for instance, but if the one who is doing this is reading this:&nbsp;<i>please </i>save the map as a different name.&nbsp;</b>"
