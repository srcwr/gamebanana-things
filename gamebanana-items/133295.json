As I was sitting in class, I was just thinking about all the different equations and problems, so I just decided to jot them down on paper, and put them into here. It kinda fits because its in the mysterious land of \"Missing Textures\" and of course math has to be involved right? Yay Algebra 2! So yeah, it's the same gameplay, just a little more for the looks. Have fun!"
