I feel that it is completed but if there is anything that anyone would like to suggest I would be happy to listen. \r\n\r\nI've checked many times for any errors or glitches and so far I haven't seemed to of found any. The bot navigation mesh works fine for me, and they do hide behind the crates.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for viewing and please leave a comment or rating, thanks :)"
