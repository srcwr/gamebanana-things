Though, I think I released it a bit late. :P\r\n\r\nBased on actual buildings from the former USSR this map is very realistic. No more soda machines and couches, this map uses new props that should improve and enhance ZM.\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\n+ Numerous new spots.\r\n+ Various bugs and exploits fixed.\r\n+ New spots and fixed ones\r\n+ Working grass texture\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
