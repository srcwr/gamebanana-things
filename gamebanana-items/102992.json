Clients on my server have appreciated it at its true worth.<br><br>And so, what's new?<br><br>— Added waypoint CT and T.<br>— Removed unnecessary parts of the map.<br>— Added zone purchase of weapons.<br>— Added zone plant the bomb.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>P. S.<br><br>Apologize for what has not managed to create a radar map to create't have time. But with time will do it.\r\n\r\n- Navigation mesh for bots handled personally by me and built into the map itself. Problems with bots?&nbsp;<br><br>No, not heard...<br><br>— Of all the modes that we have at the moment, I would advise to use this map in different modes: Death Match or Gun Games.\r\n\r\nThat's all, enjoy the game."
