It is a hard map to play as human, this means the players better stick together.\r\n\r\n**Story:**\r\nBack in the end of the 18th century, there was a woman who lived with her family in a mansion in a village days away from the nearest town. They had a good life, until someday when a decease never seen before appeared in the village. The villagers left the place, but died on the way away from there. Those who chose to stay, eventually died too.\r\n2005 - As an armed force, you have been sent to the long forgotten place to determ what killed the villagers many years ago."
