	"_sText": "This is a remake of the map surf_board_v2 (and surf_board_bomb).\r\nThis map is already a couple of years old and is still very popular on some servers. Despite the bad textures, no lighting, it really has a nice gameplay.\r\nI have retextured it, added some things like light, sun light, extra surf paths, more boards and improved the old boards... I call it the reborn of surf_board!\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I'm not sure of and that is if I got permission to post a remake of someone else's map on FPSb.. I couldn't contact this so called Fitzel, the name of the author of the original map, I think he isn't active on css anymore..\r\n\r\nPlay it on 84.195.162.228:27015 !!"
