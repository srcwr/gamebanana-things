Terrorists spawn with their APC's outside the building. Their main objective is to either destroy the generator room which supplies power, or blow up the office in the heart of the building. CT's were air dropped and spawn on a helipad ont the roof. The map layout is built so the CT's have many way to defend both bomb sites, while the T's have many ways to infiltrate each. It is a defend and assault map, and has HDR enabled.\r\n\r\nThis map also has some custom models, decals, and textures.\r\n\r\n-Spas12"
