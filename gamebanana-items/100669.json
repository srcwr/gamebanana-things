Unfortunately they were being watched and monitored by a ruthless syndicate that has made a fortune on other scientists discoveries in the world.  They have started to overtake the encampement in the early morning and now have the hostages under heavy guard in their wooden huts.\r\n\r\nThe Counter Terrorist force has been right behind the syndicate.  They are looking to set an example and have armed themselves heavily and have some of the best tactical strategists with them."
