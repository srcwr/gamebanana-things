But by time the whole team is full of scouts, the nomads will already be inside and slaughtering them...  Nomads have to invade the castle, plant a bomb either between the scaffolding and the watchtower, or near the church entrance. There are three secrets in the map. Buyzones on each side, you'll have to find them. In the church, theres a secret. I won't tell you what it does, just find it. "
