	"_sText": "My God....<br>I finally did it...<br>Project Wintermaze_2016 is finally done at base level...<br><br>Back in 2016 I started 2 things, studying at a university and working on a map. You see I had just figured out how to deal with problems in Hammer, this essentially allowed me to make bigger, more complex maps. And I wanted to put my skills and efforts to the test... So i took an old idea I had for 1.6 and made these monsters of maps...Needless to say I learned alot, made several prefabs in the process and gained a massive headache in attempting to bend Hammer to my will...<br><br><u><b><span class=\"GreenColor\">About the map pack:<br></span></b></u><br>Player count for all maps: 20vs20<br><br>The map pack contains, in total 5 maps of varying sizes, that can be classified under \"Fight Yard\" sub category.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>If you are a simple individual, that doesn't want anything complex, V1 might be for you. If you want more fun and uncertanty, V4 and V5 might be more for you. Oh and those 2 maps have functioning trams and a helicopter. V5 also has an underground tunnel system, a bit larger then v3.<br><br><b><u><span class=\"RedColor\"><span class=\"GreenColor\">ALL MAPS HAVE A FUNCTIONING MINIMAP,&nbsp;</span></span></u></b><br>I hope the green text in bold got your attention. All 5 maps have a functioning minimap, in case of V5 the minimap has 2 layers that switch, depending on if you are underground or on the surface, so that you dont get lost in the labirinth.&nbsp;<br>And just because it's a maze, doesn't mean you'll get lost, i created it to be more of a series of corridors, rather then a maze you can get lost in.&nbsp;<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><span class=\"GreenColor\"><u>v1,2,3</u></span></span> Are quite simple maps. They're not as interactive, and are rather self explanitory.&nbsp;<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><u><b>V4,5</b></u></span><br><br>&nbsp;The maps are huge and took me a long time to get them up and running.&nbsp;<br><br>They are quite interactive, not your standard layout, but you shouldn't get lost either.&nbsp; I tried to make a relatively fun maps that would be interesting to play with friends, or to wage war against other clans. Control of certain parts of these maps can be useful as there certain things that can give you an advantage (helicopter, trams, armory, warehouse, CCTV room).&nbsp; Oh and CCTV,helicopters and trams are all working.&nbsp;<br><br>The V5 map also has an interactive minimap, which works on the top left of your screen. It should change, depending on if your in tunnels or on surface.&nbsp;<br><br>The maps are quite large, very spacious, and sort of like an open world type thing. So not your typical layout.&nbsp;<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><u><b>Final words:</b></u></span><br><br>This project was a test for myself as a mapper, to see what can i come up with and do.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you'll like it and will have fun!<br><br><u><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b class=\"SelectedElement\">Individual links for maps:</b></span></u><br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V5_beta<br></b></u>https://gamebanana.com/mods/394308<br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V4_beta</b></u><br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/292411<br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V3<br></b></u>https://gamebanana.com/mods/110997<br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V2</b></u><br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/110996<br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V1<br></b></u>https://gamebanana.com/mods/110995<br><br>"
