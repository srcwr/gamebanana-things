A lot of hidden weapons. \r\nCT's can go three different ways and thus can be at all spots quickly.\r\n\r\nThere are two secrets in the bigjail, one of them is easy.\r\nTwo guns and one nade in the jails, also one way to escape.\r\nA secret to get a ball on your head and a secret to change gravity.\r\nA secret way to go pool > soccer and a soccer > lr.\r\nAnd some more.\r\n\r\nIt has a deagle trow, were the deagles are replaced with a ball. A spot for s4s. Soccer can be used for awp war. A shootout. Go in and press e while aiming at the green button. T goes left and CT goes right.  After a few secs a weapon will spawn. Time to shoot! :)\r\n\r\nIt has soccer, pool, medic, iso etc.\r\n\r\nTry it out and comment please! :)\r\n\r\n"
