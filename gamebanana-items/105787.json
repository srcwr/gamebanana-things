	"_sText": "Alright, now his was originally gonna be a scoutz level, but I decided not to because of its shear size. Anyway, this is my second developer textures level. Now even though this level is big, a round can go by surprisingly quick. I enjoyed playing against bots, but I hope to play it on a server against a few other people to put it to the full test. I actually made this map about 2 weeks ago and never got around to uploading it. Now please, do not down vote because I put an advertisement for my site in it. If given the opportunity, wouldn't you?\r\n\r\nEDIT: As a side-note, I put 154degrees under creators because that was my old name."
