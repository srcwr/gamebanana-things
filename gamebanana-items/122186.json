I have did a lot of modifications and added my own designs. I have taken the surf ramps from greatriver xdream. \r\n\r\nCredits: I am really grateful that someone out there created such a great map. I myself love greatriver and remakes of it.\r\n\r\nAnd credit to black, since I took his surf ramps."
