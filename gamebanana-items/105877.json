	"_sText": "This is a source version of the map aim_ak-colt, and no im not a newb -.- \r\n\r\nBasically my intention was to create an exact replica of the map, or close enough to it, as I thought it was deserving of such (as opposed to those 2 billion ak-colt maps with a sniper tower in the middle). Proportions are exactly the same, textures are similar, spawn points/guns are all the same. Only notable difference is the skybox, but thats only for appearance anyways. \r\n\r\nI dont know who really created the original, or else I'd give credit where its due. \r\n\r\nComments welcome."
