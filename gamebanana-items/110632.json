Prison map for dodgeball.\r\n2 versions, 1st one is plain and simple,  the 2nd one is a larger, 3 level complex with bleackable floors, teleporters, and even 1 hidden weapon. i think its between medium and big in size.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: on v2 this map, the line cant be passed from the main floor, but it can be passed on the other floors, and players can get to the enemies side through teleportals. (line not crossable in V1)\r\n\r\n1st 2 screen - V1\r\nlast 3 screens - V2"
