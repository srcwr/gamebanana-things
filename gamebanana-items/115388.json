The materials took messed up on your gun in this map but it's normal. Don't vote \"He Did Not Try\" cuz I did. I uploaded once to gmod.org a map but my account got banned and I lost it. Thnx.\r\n\r\nThis is accualy version 2.0 because I had to fix most of it (lights,buyzone,andmaterials on the floor)   but there needs to be a v1 first!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the HDR out of it might fix it..."
