	"_sText": "Here is my updated map of a maze escape map I have been working on, it will be hell for those who have never played on this map before, as they will not know what to expect.\r\n\r\nFixed buttons, obstacle health, cage room, etc.\r\n\r\nIntended for use with no-block and infinite ammo servers. However it should work alright for servers that don't have infinite ammo.\r\n\r\nFixes in 1.1:\r\n-Placed teleporter in elevator in case of people getting glitched out.\r\n-In the global teleporter, placed more coverage.\r\n-placed water in bottom of elevators."
