But you don't care do you, you want to hear about the map:\r\n\r\nIt's 12:55 A.M. and you get the call from the SWAT chief, there's a hostage situation at the city bank. Right before closing, 10 heavily armed men came in, barricaded the doors, and took 2 of the employees that knew the vault security number. You hop in your car and head down to meet with your 9 well-armed companions in the back, where the robbers have attempted to tunnel out of the basement. Your objective: Kill the robbers and rescue the hostages. You've got 3 options for entry:\r\n\r\nHop into the tunnel with no return and hope to god you can take them;\r\n\r\nEnter through the back entrance into the vault;\r\n\r\nor bust through the skylight light an action star and take siege of the place.\r\n\r\nNow that you've heard the fancy description here's some general information:\r\n\r\nIt was made by me, obviously, entirely, so please check out my profile:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/members/608513\r\n\r\nMy reason for creating it was a desire to add another submission to my studio:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/21716\r\n\r\nand the map WOULD NOT be possible without the perfect skybox from Karatekaefer:\r\n\r\n//His profile: http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/138831\r\n\r\n//The texture itself, Mpa100: http://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/1034\r\n\r\nSo please enjoy the map, and yea, it may seem a bit drab, but it's been tested on a 20 slot server and it was a lot of fun with max players!\r\n\r\n<DISS4LIFE>"
