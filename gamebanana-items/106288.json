I did fix the displacement as suggested from the other version of this map.\"GG_BlownBridge\" \r\n \r\nThere are 2 spawn places for each team. One is on the top of bridge the othere is on the catwalk just under the bridge. I did this so the hole bridge is used. By the pitcures you can't see there is a door in the tunnel to get from the top to catwalk faster. Othere then jumping down, you can do this without killing yourself from both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you like it .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny and all comments are welcomed to help in future projects... :) \r\n"
