	"_sText": "hoejhus9 has always been a popular map on my servers, but everyone hated the lighting and textures. So a few days ago I finally got around to remixing it :D I have re-done most the textures, added advanced lighting, added more spawns and even made a secret room! \n\nThe secret room opens after 30 seconds, and contains weapons with trails, faces and more :D It's been extremely popular on my server, so I thought it'd be nice to show it on here :D\n\nEnjoy!\n - Raven"
