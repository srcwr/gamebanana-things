	"_sText": "This map is a small map that has a neat design in which you can flank your enemies and/or kill them in a short and fun firefight. It has a bomb objective, in which is probably only capable of being planted if and or there are barely any team members left alive, if theres barely anyone playing on that server, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you like this map, please rate it 7 or more! It will boost my confidence in making more maps for the public to download! :) Thanks for reading and playing!"
