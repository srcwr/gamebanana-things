	"_sText": "Just an idea I came up with to help those who want to make surf maps but cant yet figure out how to make smooth surf ramps. . . this is an entire library of standard surf ramps that are used in every map.  Ive tested them and I believe all are surfable w/o and sticky areas on 66 tick. \r\n\r\n*Hint* In order to efficiently copy and paste , you can hold down the shift key whial dragging ramps to clone them."
