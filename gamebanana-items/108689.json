The two teams start in cages at opposite ends of the map, then they must traverse across three \"skyrails\" into a combat zone which features two sniper towers, lots of water and plenty of cover.\r\n\r\nTeams start with the basic weapons, no buyzones just what you can find lying on the ground.\r\n\r\nPeace out, y'all."
