Only Humans can use it. when a human is on the top of the tower, a nuke starts automaticly.\r\n\r\nYou think the Spots are to hard to defend?\r\nYeah i know, but i was always really bored of only shooting in the same direction. on this map the gameplay should be thrilling. i think the map is very balanced^^.\r\n\r\nYou think the Map looks like a gg_map?\r\nyeah.. omg... it looks like a gg_map... i know.... but why cant a zm-map look cool?\r\n\r\n\r\nso have ur fun on this map and please comment and rate. :D"
