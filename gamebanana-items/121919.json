If you have any suggestions to help/fix this please tell me.\r\nRamps under the shotguns are a little sticky.\r\nThe boosts after the spawn ramp are sticky sometimes or bump you off.\r\n\r\nI'd greatly appreciate any suggestions or ideas for the map, as well as suggestions to fix certain problems.\r\n\r\nPlease download before rating!\r\nThanks!"
