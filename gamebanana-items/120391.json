	"_sText": "This is a map project for this Halloween. It is a office map with a FEAR theme. The map has been edited and is now at least twice as large as cs_office_extended which is the base for this project. First thing i should note is despite all my attempts at opting this map, i couldn't get the map to compile under full vis which would get stuck every time, so the map is fast vis. If that doesn't bother you then enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits -----\r\n\r\n-Bones-\r\n \r\nCreated by S-LoW.\r\n\r\nUploaded by Â£cho.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Map Base cs_office_extended by Maugan-\r\n\r\nOriginal Source Version by Turtle Rock Studios\r\n\r\nOriginal Version by Hobbit"
