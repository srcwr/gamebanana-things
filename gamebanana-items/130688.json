However, when one phase is won, it won't appear ever again.\r\nI wouldn't recommend taking this map too seriously but if you do, after beating all the phases, a special mode will be unlocked (and you will be able to play any of the four phases again). If you beat this special mode, I will say something cute about you. Maybe.\r\n\r\nAbout the boss:\r\nIf you are choosen as a zombie to be the boss, the usage instructions should appear on your screen.\r\nThe boss fight area will be 1 out of the 3 possible arenas.\r\nIf the boss' camera is too hard to control, you can press E to use your regular camera. But you shouldn't do it because you are a very good player and you don't need any help to kill every human.\r\nAlong with the four basic attacks, the boss will passively spawn weak minions which can actually infect humans."
