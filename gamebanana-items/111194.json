This may not be perfect but its alright.\r\n\r\nIn short its a fun map to play, it contains a gg version suitable for Gun Game and can be challenging even with the radar.  Have fun guys.\r\n\r\nThe radar isn't working properly, it repeats itself, if anyone knows why contact me.  Everything is embedded in BSP."
