Many areas were laid directly through walls (and some areas weren't constructed at all, including ladders) that led to absolutely inadequate behavior of bots. All these errors of auto-generation were carefully fixed!<br><br>Well... Bots use all possible ways and surely move on all areas of the map now! :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: The bots (and the people too, naturally) don't use for pass a blocked door in bunker (GuardHouse). It's simply insignificant omission (or a strange idea) of the map author, but not the omission of this Navigation Mesh!<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also your responses are still important for me ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:&nbsp; wostok (for this remarkable map with wide space for fights, also for his other fine maps - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/142557\">de_bribery_subrosa</a>, <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/149142\">de_severance</a> and one of my most favorite <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/151619\">de_fedra_autumn</a>).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:&nbsp; BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),&nbsp; CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>The Neverending Story about Dust and Rust! :D<br><br><br>"
