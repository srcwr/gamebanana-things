The screen shots don't do it justice. Much time and research has gone into making the ship and its layout as realistic as possible - gameplay balance was less important. Some features have been added to make the gameplay very different from normal (some players will like this, others will hate it). Most time and work has gone into getting this huge map to compile without critical errors! Please tell me if you find any serious bugs/problems!\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nmap, custom textures, most custom sounds &amp; all sound editing by Olivier Doorenbos\r\nwww.CGTextures.com - source of most raw custom textures\r\ndasboot original music by Klaus Doldinger\r\ndasboot disco remix music by Disco Cell\r\ncrimson tide music by Hanz zimmer\r\nship horn sound from www.youtube.com/BIGMIKESOCAL\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES:\r\nYou can do whatever you want (distribute, edit the VMF file, release modified version etc) as long as you give me credit where it is due and do not profit financially. If you distribute this map, you must include THIS README.<br>"
