Designed for deathmatch, but can be played with rounds.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n2d skybox\r\n.nav file\r\nmulti-floor design\r\n\r\nInstillation:\r\nExtract the .bsp and .nav to your \\cstrike\\maps folder and play\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- If you like the map leave feedback and a rating on what you liked, didn't like, or what you think could be improved upon. If you didn't like it, feel free to leave suggestions and what made it an un-pleasurable experience\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n- Doubled sun brightness\r\n- Added ~15 more lights and light_spots for more visibility\r\n- Couple texture glitch fixes"
