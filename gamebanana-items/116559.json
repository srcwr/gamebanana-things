Do some planning.\r\n\r\nMy first public map, still learning the ropes.\r\n\r\nBF2 style briefing:\r\nIn an effort to frighten the UN and acquire additional power, the WTF (World Terrorist Federation) has captured an ancient temple in the deserts near the current, and deadly battleground codenamed de_dust one and two.  If the WTF continues possession of this vital base, the de_dust battlegrounds could become theirs.  Last night,  \r\n8 Counter-Terrorists arrived by boat expecting to be brought to de_dust, instead, they were driven to this the temple, and were told to hide an a hole for 24 hours until the other 8 met up with them.  Their surprise attack to secure the base will begin upon your arrival."
