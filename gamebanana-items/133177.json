	"_sText": "I've played a lot of ZM maps and while there are a few high quality maps, many of the ones out there are quickly made and don't even play properly or are broken. I took a couple days to make a map in Hammer that at least should play well and be fun for both humans and zombies, with plenty of places to fight. So basically, it's not that pretty, but not buggy and hopefully pretty well balanced! =)\r\n\r\nDate of release: 10/29/2006\r\nMap: zm_zomgzombies_v1\r\nAuthor: yacoub (yacoub35 on FPSBanana)\r\nMap is for play with: ZombieMod CS:Source mod\r\nMax players: 40 (20 T and 20 CT spawnpoints)\r\nDesigned with: Hammer\r\nOptimization level: High (Should run smooth on all machines)\r\n\r\nInstallation: Extract the .bsp file to your /maps folder where your other CS:Source maps are located.\r\n\r\nNotes: This is the first iteration. Enjoy! =)"
