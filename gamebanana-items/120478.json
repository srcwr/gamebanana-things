I made this map within one day and it wasn't intentionally surf. however, once I found out how fun it was its popularity grew and has been a hit with most people on the server.\r\n\r\nsv_airaccelerate 2000 (helps with surfing)\r\n\r\nThere are loads of things to discover on this map and it's a great to muck about with stuff, such as knife fights on the planes (shoot the bars to let them swoop down), and it's great to knife noobs once you've mastered the surf.\r\n\r\nPlease give this map a chance, as it's more fun once you're used to it."
