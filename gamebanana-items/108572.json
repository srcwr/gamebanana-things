	"_sText": "This map was designed to improve players skills with a scout and basic pistols [glock, usp].\r\nThe overall map  design came from serveral maps from condition zero and counter strike 1.6.\r\nLayout, spawns are lower than the floor of the map to prevent spawn killing, known issue in server awp and scout maps.\r\nThere are 4 basic areas of play, the spawn, sniper towers, buildings and the sewers.\r\nThis map has 32 spawn points, 16 terrorist, 16 counter terrorist.\r\nOnly issues know, No clip texture by one of the sniper towers.  Doesn't give any advantages.  Just a small mistake on my part.\r\nScouts only have 10 rounds in the guns do to the lack of hammer's ability to read ammo entities or strings to add ammo.\r\n\r\nThanks to the members of Interlopers.net for tutorials and all sites providing this map and the players who learn from it.\r\n\r\nDesigned by [FuK]D|cE"
