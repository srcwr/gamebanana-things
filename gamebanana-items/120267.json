	"_sText": "Wtih this map i wanted that people have fun with other form.  Dont defused bombs or rescued nostages so I decided to make my second map of jail. Ba_prison_future. (CTs andTs will respawn with knife).\r\n\r\n I decided to make one that is futuristic so I put models from HL2, doors that open when you are near of them, soldiers from Hl2 who can push you if you are near of him and can speak... I saw that people use to play maps of  jails that have got always the same form and only change the  textures so i decided to make one a bit diferent ( for example the jails will open with a scanner eye) ^^.\r\n\r\nThe map has got  a game like stepmania. There is a pool and somes rooms where you can escape of the Cts and  vents with witch T can escape from the jail and get a weapon to kill CTs. There are lasers on the vents so if someone touch that a sirene will play the sound and somes lights will turn on.\r\n\r\nI create a form to kill Ts if CTs want that ^^. There is a room. If where you can lock the door and open other that  will push him to the space and kill them because they havent got oxygen ^^ \r\n\r\nI wish see my map at diferent servers and that people will have fun with it ^^ thanks"
