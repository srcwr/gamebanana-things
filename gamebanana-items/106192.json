I think i love this engine, and this is first, and not the last mine created source map :)\r\n\r\n So, about this map;\r\n\r\n This map have 24 different spawn points;\r\n Both teams have AK-47 and M4A1\r\n I think not bad gameplay, because I'm not played source so much;\r\n Added simple fog, which makes map more realistic;\r\n And about map structure, design, I don't know how all of you this design, because it's my first map, and when I tried, i haven't cs:s textures, only hl2, so why I', used this map textures :D But now, it's everything fine, and I'm ready to create one more map for Counter-Strike: Source game :)\r\n\r\n So, I'm waiting for all of your comment & rate of this map. Because I really want hear, what you GB members think about my first source engine map. Where do I need to excel more?"
