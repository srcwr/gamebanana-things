	"_sText": "Hello guys, my nickname is vandyke. I started with mapping as cs 1.6 came out. All my maps were made in cs 1.6 version. this map is a remake from 1.6. \r\n\r\nLong time after mapping i did nothing for CS. This was a first try to convert the map to the new source engine. Now i feel like in old days. I am full of ideas and lust of mapping and now i am more experienced. I hope you'll have fun.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it's a aim map, but you can also have a lot of fun with players at lans. There is 1 AWP and 2 SCOUTS in water (who will be first ?!). Hint: try also to get very high for the sniper place for another awp (look on the overview screenshot ;))\r\n\r\nedit: created and added the map overview and the radar to  \r\nthe map.\r\n\r\nvideo of the map:\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/a49KkWJ_aLk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
