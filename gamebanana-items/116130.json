(from mario kart: 64)\r\n\r\n- Level Improvements: Fixed all sorts of bugs/leaks from the old map.\r\n\r\n- Level Addition: New funny skybox with a spinning sun at the bottom of the map, a jail that players will get teleported into instead of just dying when they fall out of the map and a bridge with some platforms under the map that hosts a small addition/secret.\r\n\r\nAlso, credits to the guy who created the first map, who apparently nobody knows of.."
