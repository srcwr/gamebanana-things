	"_sText": "This is the first map attempted by myself, Daev, and a lifelong friend of mine, Mike. We started messing around in Hammer a while back, and eventually decided to try to create something, in this case, based on our own houses. Being the simplistic two we are, we went with a Death Match map, seeing as there's also not enough room for a bomb site or hostage rescue. Some things aren't perfect yet, but it can make for one hell of a session with about 5vs5, but spawn points offers a max of 24vs24."
