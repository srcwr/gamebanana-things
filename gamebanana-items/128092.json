Thanks to skillor for creating his HE_give_boxes prefab or this map wouldn't of been! http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3860 Thanks skillor!\r\nAswell many thanks to Instant b0b for his awesome texture pack!\r\n\r\nThis map will be best for a minigame server and will ensure plenty of replay and loads of fun.\r\n\r\nIf not already, I would suggest turning off auto team balance (mp_autoteambalance 0) and changing the team limit (mp_limitteams 40) depending on the server size.\r\nPlease leave all pros and cons and what you would like to see in the future for this map! Feel free to edit and repost the map as long as you mention my name and if using the prefabs, mention 'skillor'. and if keeping the current textures, mention \"Instant b0b\"!"
