	"_sText": "De_area52, originally from my favorite console shooter, Perfect Dark, was one of my first maps. I started it not knowing much about map making, for almost 2 years I worked on and off with it. Again, every time I would learn something new I would implement it into the map. After 2 totally different versions of the map I decided to go through it once more, use my abilities to optimize it and make it worth the wait.\r\n\r\nPeople were always telling me to \"make use of the Source engine\" those words stuck with me for a long time. I kept having trouble debating on if I was “sourcifing” the map too much or not enough. At it’s final state I think I hit a good blend between the two. Though I still think there are areas that are too plain, I’m proud and happy with the final result.\r\n"
