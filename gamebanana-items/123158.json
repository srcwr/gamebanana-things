	"_sText": "Surf_torus_beta5b is a relatively small surf map, however it contains many of the best features players have come to expect from surf maps. There is a jail which can be escaped from, a jail harming laser that can be activated from outside and various weapon pickups around the world which encourage the player to explore the diverse surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that this map is still in the significant editing stages and i would appreciate any feedback. Contact me at atommic22@hotmail.com with any suggestions or ideas you find pertinent."
