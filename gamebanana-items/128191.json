This map should be build in jungle style but looks more like in a forrest. This map is build with Bees[Cz], but he quited becouse of he study's. This map is way different to other course maps, it isn't too long and not too hard.\r\n\r\nWhat do the map contains?\r\n\r\n\t- Nice design.\r\n\t- Much detail.\r\n\t- Good lightning.\r\n\t- Some new traps.\r\n\t- Variation to other course maps.\r\n\r\nFixxe's\r\n\t\r\n\t- Fixed Spawn Proctection bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map.
