When I started making this map I was planning to create a longer more technical map that would require good routing for a good run. It didn't quite end up how I hoped and ended up become more of a strafe style map. Intended to be about a minute or so but lost inspiration so I just decided to release it, map length is around 40-50 seconds.&nbsp;<br><br>Hopefully my next map will be longer and more technical. I stream my mapping sometimes on twitch: <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/zenticbhop\" target=\"_blank\">twitch.tv/zenticbhop</a> (shameless plug).<br><br>Enjoy! :)<br><br><h3><i><a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/196291\">CS:GO Port</a></i></h3>"
