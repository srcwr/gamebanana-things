It has custom decals and sounds and an overview but everything is pakrat'd so that it is easier to download and easier for the user. No folders, no mess. Enjoy! \r\n\r\nEdit - I recently found out that I had placed the overview wrong into the BSP sorry but you will have to re-download it to see it properly.\r\n\r\nDouble edit - The overview somehow became corrupted and now I need to remake it I will be taking the map down for a couple of minutes to rectify this, sorry! You can download a version without the purple and black overview till then.\r\n\r\nFinal edit - I got the overview working and pak'd it for you, download and enjoy!"
