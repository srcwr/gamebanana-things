	"_sText": "Its a mini game where you use oldschool weapons to kill your enemies. Can be played as a free for all since you can use the weapons against your teammates, or could be team battles. The weapons include a spear a sword and a bow all work and move with you. I created all the weapons from scratch myself if you do take them at least give me credit especially since the bow was a bit tricky to make. [IMPORTANT-To fire the bow just press e on the string fire it as many times as you want, if experienced can be the most powerful weapon there.] Just a funny little map to joke around with. If you like the map please leave a comment so in the future I know to release more of this stuff I've made just sitting on my comp thanks. (no custom files included so no worries about that)\r\n7v7 teams or 14 free for all"
