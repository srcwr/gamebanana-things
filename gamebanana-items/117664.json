But, while I was creating it, I understood, that it would better to make the structure of my map more difficult. So, here is a result.\r\n\r\nYou can find a scheme of this map in screenshots. It will show you the detailed map structure.\r\n\r\n### **It is better to play in small teams (2-6 players in one team).** \r\n\r\n### **Average round duration: 30~5 seconds.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ **If you like it - rate this submission!** _\r\n\r\n_ **Comments and wishes (and even critic:) are welcome!** _\r\n \r\nP.S Sorry for my letterless english. I am from Russia)."
