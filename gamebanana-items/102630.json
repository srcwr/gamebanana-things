Screen shots are without HDR)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVersion 1.1  -  28/02/09\r\n1. Increased to 32 player map.\r\n2. 'Clip' added to stop platers getting onto pool room roof.\r\n3. Improvements to Nav file, with very helpful advise from Chizbone.\r\n4. Roof design changed to get rid of 'black texture' (large skylight with steel frame)\r\n5. Added a few more props to long hall & roof terrace.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy third and defiantly my best counter strike source map to date.\r\nLoosely based and inspired by a real world location.\r\n\r\nDe_horseshoe is a medium sized defuse map with 2 bomb sites.\r\n\r\nBomb site A located by the horse statue next to CT spawn.\r\nBomb site B located by 'headless' statue in the central court yard.\r\n\r\nBSP Map file includes:-\r\nNav file.\r\nMap overview for spectators.\r\nRader overview for players.\r\nAll areas are named and have ambient sound.\r\nSpawns for 17 per side.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy. Please comment and rate if you download.\r\nRick_0_Shay\r\n"
