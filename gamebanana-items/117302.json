	"_sText": "<p>This was basically a map that was trench vs, trench, I then extended it from a muddy trench to a more sand-like trench, from here i then thought that having trenches would be boring. I then thought of something to put in the middle; a construction of a building (as you can see).</p><p>I then noticed if this ever was going to be added to a server that may have DM in it (constant respawns) I would have to stop people from killing others in their spawn from up top of the building. So to resolve this I added a bullet protection brush over the spawn to prevent spawn killing.</p><p>Hope you like this map:) More will come!</p><p>Map #1 Check it here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op3suleEidE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op3suleEidE</a></p><p>Love feedback too! =)</p>"
