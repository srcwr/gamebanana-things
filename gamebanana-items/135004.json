Kick those nasty terrorists out of your factory. \r\n\r\nFight for control.\r\n\r\nMap created by UnPro. \r\n \r\nFor ClanWarCore UK.\r\n\r\nLevel Unknown Studios \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my 4th release on FPSB, this map was a project for a friend. \r\nAll in all it took 2 light days of work, from concept to upload.\r\n\r\nCompile time was less than 3 minutes. \r\n\r\nIt is capable of supporting 32 players, however it is a very small map, \r\nso the more payers, the crazier it will get."
