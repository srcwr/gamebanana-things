YOU CAN FIND IT HERE: <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/27836\">GG_STOO_CZKTWO.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nI'M KEEPING THIS VERSION AROUND FOR POSTERITY, AND IN CASE ANYONE PREFERS IT TO THE NEW ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis took a few days to do, on and off. Almost everything in the map has been altered in some way. The other Chinzak for GG is barely altered from the original DM map. People would leave the server when it came on, saying it was too laggy or too hard to navigate. This map is a response to those complaints.\r\n\r\nShould be considerably easier to navigate than the original DM map. Should also run considerably faster despite having high-res cubemaps and high-res lightmaps.\r\n\r\nThis is the first release so there may be problems I haven't found on my own. If so, I'll release a fixed version.\r\n\r\nFeatures a few custom textures created by me. Learning Photoshop as I go.\r\n\r\nCompile time on my very average PC was 5 mins exactly.\r\nVBSP took about 2 seconds.\r\nVVIS took about 5 seconds.\r\nVRAD took about 4 mins 53 seconds. :)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy playing this map as much as I enjoyed making it.\r\n\r\nCheers to _TIF_ who made the original DM map in the first place!\r\n\r\nStOo (<a href=\"http://www.betaneutral.com\">www.betaneutral.com</a>)"
