The map is a battlefield for fairly dynamic firefights on each section of the map.<br><br>The textures and props of the map are mainly taken from the de_dust series of maps, but despite this it is absolutely unlike them and is unique in its kind.<br><br><span class=\"SelectedElement\">The idea of building this map arose in January 2024 and now I am glad to share with you the result of our team's efforts. I hope you enjoy playing on this map and it will gain at least some popularity despite the fact that this version of the game is not very popular these days.</span><br><br>I recommend to download the latest version of the map."
