	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map CS_HARBORBANK<br><br>Nav Creator: Meurglis3, Release Date: September 18 2015<br><br>Here is the Navigation Mesh for awesome map <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/19835\">cs_harborbank</a> by SM Sith Lord (released January 2007). It's an almost fully created from scratch and totally hand-tuned .nav-file (because original map author's .nav-file embedded in .bsp was not fully playable).<br><br>This Navigation Mesh is hand-made approximately for 80%. Most areas and paths were created manually because during an auto-generation processing the majority of them were constructed incorrectly or incomplete. The special attention was paid to exact control of ladders, also to numerous narrow apertures in walls and floors. The underground part of pathways was also carefully reworked!<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh was fully Place Painted.<br><br>Well... bots have all opportunities for overcoming the most difficult obstacles in their way now. And they are ready to enter deadly fight for your insured deposits! :D<br><br>Important to understand some traditional restrictions (for cs_type maps) in movement of hostages: they aren't capable to pass through a narrow pipes (underground level of map), also through some window openings!<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/19835\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: SM Sith Lord (for fine designed and high detailed assault-themed map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Easy Money, Cash Only! :-)<br><br>P.S. Unfortunately, this highly detailed map with unique layout wasn't properly optimized. Therefore only happy owners of powerful PCs will be able to take pleasure in game with enough bots :-(<br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br><br><b>UPDATED 21.09.2015</b><br><br>General Fixes:\r\n<br>- Improved bot's movement around a Hostage Rescue Zone;\r\n<br>- Reduced file size.<br><br><b>PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!</b><br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
