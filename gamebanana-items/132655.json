Good luck finding it :)\r\n\r\nI would just like to point out that this is my first ever map, please if you are going to criticize, do it constructively.\r\n\r\nMap should be place in Steam\\steamapps\\usernamehere\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nThere are also 2 custom decals used, these should be placed in:\r\nSteam\\steamapps\\usernamehere\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\materials\\decals\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading :)"
