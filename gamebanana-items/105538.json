Sorry for the ideatheft, but atleast I'm admitting it.. I love the original map so much, but only wished it was a bit different. with no textures. \r\n\r\nI made this map for my own fun, and I love playing it.. Works ok with bots, but they know where you are almost all the time.. \r\nSo, better against humans than bots.. Sorry about that.."
