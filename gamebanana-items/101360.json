I hope you’ll like it.\r\n\t\r\nParts of building in the map are originated from 'Shanhua Police Station'. \t\r\nIt is located at southern part of Taiwan, Shanhua District, \t \r\nwhich is a dazzling building causing my desire to create a map for it. \t\r\nNevertheless, due to its gigantic size, I can't place the whole building in to my map, but only the front.\r\n \t\r\nidea: \t\r\nA truck containing highly dangerous cargo is lost it control, and then brakes in front of the Shanhua Police Station. \t\r\nMission: \t\r\nCT – To stop TR from exploding the mass destruction weapon in the truck. \t\r\nTR – Plan a C4 bomb in the truck to explode the mass destruction weapon. \t\r\nP.S. The trigger of the weapon is damaged by the crashing of the truck. C4 bomb is the only way to activate the bomb! \t\r\n \t\r\nI'm not used to custom textures. Probably there are some mistakes I guess.    If you could give me some advices, I would appreciated it. :)\r\n \t\r\n--------------------------------------------------- \t\r\nTextures - Valve,     [cgtextures](http://www.cgtextures.com/ \"cgtextures\")\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks  \t\r\ntsukibosi \t\r\nText translated by hendychiang  \t\r\n\r\nLastly, if bugs are found, please feel free to report us :) \r\n\t\r\n-------------------------------------------------\t \r\n\t\r\nModify  Version 1.1 \t\r\nThis version has fixed bugs and done some optimized. \t\r\nAdded fog \t\r\nAdded Radar \t\r\nAdded BOT  \r\nFixed Bugs \t\r\nFixed lighting"
