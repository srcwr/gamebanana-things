	"_sText": "To get across to the otherside you need to jump ontop of the train and jump off on the otherside, if you fall you will fall in the canyon and die.\r\n\r\nBombsite is under the train track, to get under the track T have to go in the tall building and go down in the hole. CT have to go in the bunker and go in the hole.\r\n\r\nThere is a second train higher then the first which also goes faster then the one running above the canyon, if you get hit by the train you will die but if you crouch between the wheels of the carrages you will get pushed along.\r\n\r\nNo known bugs, if you find any please tell me and i will try to fix them as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease play before commenting/ assessing, screenshots don't do the map justice.\r\n\r\nThanks you and please comment/ access."
