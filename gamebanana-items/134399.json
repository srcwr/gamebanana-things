I think it turned out really well for me being sick when I made it and I hope you enjoy it as well. \r\n\r\nThe box texture is custom, and the detail bump makes it look amazing. \r\n\r\nThank you <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/116136\">deathangel</a> for making the custom studio logo\r\nThank you <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/162551\">hacksawjack</a> for making the nosoul inc logo. \r\n\r\nAll textures are included in the BSP, so no extra downloading is required.
