Don't forget to look on [www.kipteam.tk](http://www.kipteam.tk \"K!PTeam site\") if you would like to join our clan.\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\nThis is a 4 player map. There are 2 people inside the maze and 2 on top of the maze. The people on top are the captains and can give directions. A team wins when all enemy players are dead. This can be accomplished by reaching the end and pressing the button or by finding weapons and shooting the enemy. \r\n\r\nIt is important that you use tactics! \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nYou can kill the enemy captain to gain an advantage."
