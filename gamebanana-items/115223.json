	"_sText": "This map uses the layout of \"knas_speedcastle_css\", which I enjoy playing quite a lot. My own version has a different theme and uses more possibilities or the source engine concerning lightning and amount of brushes, etc, while still being playable at decent fps rates. \r\n\r\nI used the pk01 texture pack, which can be freely used and modified. I tuned the normal maps a bit and included the ones needed for the map in the bsp file, so no stuff like installing the materials is needed.\r\nA NAV File for the bots is included in the bsp. \r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy playing this map, which I would claim to be a mix of a fun map and a optically quite serious map, though it has a unrealistic theme, of course. \r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a beta version. It is finished, but I might consider modifying some things after I got enough feedback - if there are any serious gameplay issues, for example. \r\n\r\nGo, go, go ;-)"
