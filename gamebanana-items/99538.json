Terrorists spawn in the building, CTs - behind a fence. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Five hostages are placed in rooms on both floors of a country house.<br><br>Here it is possible to use ample opportunities for maneuvering, bypassing the yard and a country house from all directions. And open windows in the building aren't present. But there is couple of balconies, the pool in a small court yard and a labyrinth from a cut bushes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>More or less playable NAV-file for playing against the Bots embedded in BSP.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Thanks Patzilla for its nice map (and also for its other remarkable map <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/119132\">cs_boathouse_hdr</a>).\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Play and Enjoy!"
