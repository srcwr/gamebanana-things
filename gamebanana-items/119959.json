	"_sText": "V1.1 Updates: Fixed CT Spawn Area, Created a small jetty on the water, More scope weapons for Terrorist, Raised Sun, Added more screen shots (Sorry about it only having 1 earlier)\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-This map is of a rectangular Shape\r\n\r\n-The Floor leads to the Edge, but you don't fall out\r\n\r\n-It's as if you are playing inside of a diorama\r\n\r\n-Water was made so that it was harder to get out\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nInformation: The goal for the Counter-Terrorist's in this map should be rated Hard, this is because they spawn from a people carrier and they are facing directly at a cliff face, with Terrorists up above. The Terrorist's do have a pretty big advantage as they can cover from the opposing force easier, But the weapons above the cliff are limited to 2 Scouts and 1 Awp (As well as enough AK47's for the rest of the team). Ct's have more, Though some of witch are hidden, At there spawn they are able to pick up an m4a1.\r\n\r\n"
