	"_sText": "This map should hopefully have fixed most of the bugs in the original version.\r\n\r\nKnown bugs/fixes:\r\nMost of the buttons have a standard texture.\r\nThe middle button works where you will not die by the AFK Killer.\r\nThe house level makes a little more sense on how to buy items.\r\nThe buttons should all lock when you hit one to stop 2 levels opening at once.  It may be possible by hitting them at the same time but it shouldn't happen.\r\nThe race map has been extended a little bit to make it a little bit more fun and challenging.\r\nThe are now two blocks on the pistols level to stop CT's throwing a few nades in to the stars area so all the T's don't get murdered in a flash.\r\nThe glass level now has a small room so you shouldn't fall in to the glass area.\r\nThe AFK killer also now sets once you hit a button except the middle one.  The downside though to this is that if no one goes to hit a button the killer won't kill the people.\r\nSome areas were dark and now you can see them a bit better.\r\n\r\nNow have fun killing each other."
