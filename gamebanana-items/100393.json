	"_sText": "This is probably my first map that I actually put a lot of work into. Took about 1-2 weeks to make. There's only 1 bug, which doesn't really get in the way of gameplay, which is the roof. If you ever notice, the roof may look a bit strange. For some reason, in Hammer, I try to use the vertex editor to shape the brushes into a roof, but whenever I compile the map or launch hammer again, some of the brushes go back into a cube, so some parts of the roof look a bit strange. Oh, and try not to fall in the water, because there's no way out.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
