My first map actually.\r\nIt took me a few days to finish the map.\r\nThis map provides room for 2 to 24 players, there are several ways to get into the opponents fort.\r\nWhen you spawn you can choose ak-47 or m4a1, if you wont die your weapons will be kept.\r\nThere's an awp on the roof which is a bit tricky to grab.\r\nEach fort got a door which can only be opened from inside.\r\n\r\nWrite some comments and let me know what you think :D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest version is here:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/56742"
