The various small levels composing it are all connected to a central pit. With a layout such as this, set aside your old habits and quickly learn to look up and down. If you don't, you won't live long.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As the map is very small, the rounds will not last long. It is impossible to be lost as every passages lead to the central pit... where everyone life-span is short, very short.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>And don't forget: we are in CS:S, so you can fall from any height into 2 inches of water and you won't take any damage at all.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>- from review at <a href=\"http://netday.be\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">NetDay.be</a>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>About Playing with Bots: NAV-file for playing against the Bots (embedded in .bsp-file) are more or less playable, though isn't optimized manually.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Good Luck and Happy Frags! Also Great Thanks to Prabab for his Nice Work."
