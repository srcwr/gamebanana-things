	"_sText": "Hey guys, i really only made this map to jive up some ideas for map making. Prior to making this map which took me about a day I worked on 8 different maps/ideas trying to create something that was unique, fun, aesthetically pleasing and good. Unfortunately I have been stumped on what to do so I decided to take inspiration from bhop_anyyy and create a map similar to it. This was however probably the most annoying thing I have ever dealt with, bug fixing took me about 4-5 hours because of an entity leak (somehow it got fixed). Don't even know how i fixed it but w/e lol anyways im going to publish it just for the sake of it, the map itself was pretty fun but yeah hf<br><br>20-30s&nbsp;"
