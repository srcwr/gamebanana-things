This is the crappiest example of my work, with this map I was just trying to test the engine's capability to pretty much disregard vis. BTW This is compiled with fast vis, it honestly wouldn't matter. If you're gonna lag from this map, you're gonna do it either way, unless you wanna hide in a house the whole round :D.\r\n\r\nMy next maps will be orig. style (precise skybox and vis limitations, not open massive free-roam areas). This was just for fun.\r\n\r\nThere's no real story to the map, make something up, because its fake. Lol jk, I'm not that lame, it's just that this map is called Fellujah yet the majority of the places that are actually recreated in the map are from Israel lmao. I just want people to see this map and be like \"What the fuck is that giant stupid wall\" and maybe they'll actually realize that that giant stupid wall really exists in real life... and if I was the person building this map (the world) I wouldn't have really put it there. :)\r\n\r\nHere's the pictures I based the map off, you'll notice some parts actually look a lot like the pictures, at least I tried! :P.\r\n\r\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/gal.php?g=04baghdadxlarge1a.jpg\r\n\r\nAnyways, Special thanks to Innocent Hawk, SZFlow, Totenkopf, Fps_2k, EoS, and everyone in the community for helping beta test & assess... and shoot me in the face with an awp like 900 times :D.\r\n\r\nCome check out our site & servers, http://www.claneos.com ...our pub server was playing the beta, although we will be most likely be updating to the full version soon. OPERATION DESERT STORM!!!!! -fps :D\r\n\r\nP.S. If you're going to decompile it JUST ASK ME and I'll send you the god damn vmf file (and textures and sounds), I hate when people steal, if a community can't work together it's not very commune is it?.. Ask me here or on the EoS site doesn't matter. :)\r\n\r\n...god last map I released was either for The Specialists.. but I still miss AHL, anyone still out there? ;D\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************************\r\nI was flagged illegal by anonymous (obviously the person who commented innapropriate), so I'd just like to show you some of the decals around this map.\r\nhttp://img156.imageshack.us/i/fellujah028.jpg/ [img]http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6676/fellujah028.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/i/fellujah026.jpg/ [img]http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/3046/fellujah026.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/i/fellujah021.jpg/ [img]http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/7743/fellujah021.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img299.imageshack.us/i/fellujah017.jpg/ [img]http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/6932/fellujah017.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/i/fellujah016.jpg/ [img]http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/7393/fellujah016.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/i/fellujah015.jpg/ [img]http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/1851/fellujah015.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/i/fellujah014.jpg/ [img]http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/3835/fellujah014.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/i/fellujah013.jpg/ [img]http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/825/fellujah013.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img514.imageshack.us/i/fellujah012.jpg/ [img]http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/8797/fellujah012.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/i/fellujah011.jpg/ [img]http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/3011/fellujah011.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/i/fellujah010.jpg/ [img]http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/6581/fellujah010.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/i/fellujah009.jpg/ [img]http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/9245/fellujah009.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/i/fellujah008.jpg/ [img]http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/184/fellujah008.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img249.imageshack.us/i/fellujah007.jpg/ [img]http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/3654/fellujah007.th.jpg[/img]\r\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/i/fellujah006.jpg/ [img]http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5744/fellujah006.th.jpg[/img]\r\n"
