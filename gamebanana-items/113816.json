	"_sText": "Generally this is fy_poolparty but its highly developed in gameplay manner. \r\n\r\nI kept the original look, because I love it, just like you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral changes:\r\n-The map is bigger(harder to hit from distance and harder to rush)\r\n-Completely new side obstacles. Improved for headshots\r\n-Easy entering and exiting from the water everywhere. You can walk into the water( only in the middle is deep)\r\n-Same on the both sides\r\n-Much more variants to defend and to rush. There is where to hide or cover\r\n-Almost every edje is cutted for better chance of making and getting a headshot\r\n-Tested and improved heights, angles and positions of every element\r\n\r\nHere it\\'s all about the gameplay. The map is poolparty as you know it but with much improved gameplay. It\\'s really fun to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is pro version of the fy_poolparty-> http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/19216\r\n\r\n\r\nI\\'M WAITING FOR YOUR COMMENT AND SUGGESTIONS!\r\n\r\n10X TO THE ORIGINAL AUTOR FOR GIVING US SUCH COOL MAP!"
