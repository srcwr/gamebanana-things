	"_sText": "This is the final (And I must say epic) version in the \"Fy_coldworld\" series. I've added another way to get from spawn to spawn. Of course I left the bouncy diving board, exept I added a sound for when you jump off.I've also added some cool lightning effects with lighting and some sounds. I also fixed the extreme lighting and turned it down a notch to make the other lights noticable. I ALSO made the skybox more reasonable to it's environment because I'm pretty sure there are no iceburgs on islands.(?) And I fixed the sniping positions from being hard to get in to.\r\nLastly, I fixed the old water to cool new water.\r\nAnd again, bare with me this, is my 3rd map (Or the 3rd version of my first map)\r\nENJOY YOU SILLY LITTLE TROLLS!"
