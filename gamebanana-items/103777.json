I made this map in July of 2020 and finished it on December but wasn't pleased with the result so i remade it for CS:GO as de_cncrete.<br><br>This map is really bad. I think is leaking and some of the stairs don't align with the hammer grid if I'm not wrong so i will not update it but i thought that it'll be fun to upload it.<br><br><br>"
