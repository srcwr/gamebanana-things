(this won't take down your fps on a server)\r\nif you play with  20 bots obviously it will.\r\n**\r\n\r\nMultiple accespoints, outside as inside.\r\nit's not a big map, so good for GG.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT*****\r\nMinor changes in updated version :\r\n-fixed textures\r\n-delete several props causing fps drops.\r\n-made it brighter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n//i will probably also make a DE or CS map out of this one in the future."
