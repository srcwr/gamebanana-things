I'm not sure if people will like the textures at all, but I don't feel like re-texturing this map so I'm just releasing it as is. It's mostly very close quarters so this map if a good rushing map. If you like it or hate it, please leave a comment anyway! :)\r\n\r\nBtw, I don't know how to make a custom skybox so I just used a stock one. I hope it doesn't take away from the look too much.\r\n\r\n**buyzones included for use without gg mod."
