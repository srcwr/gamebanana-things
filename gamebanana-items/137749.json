Difficulty wise i feel that it is \r\nsomewhere between Tier2 and Tier3. The bonuses are ~Tier4<br><br>Evo Update (Thanks to feedback from Granis):<br>* Use Landmark Angles on trigger_teleports<br>* Teleporters on the bonuses no longer allow the players to keep their speed<br>*\r\n Adapted the surf angle on ramps where the layout allowed it without \r\ndestroying the original feeling of the map (might lower difficulty \r\nslightly)<br>* Optimized skybox and void facing textures<br>* Changed Bonus2 to ordinary gravity (might increase difficulty slightly)<br>* Players no longer take fall damage<br><br>Evo2 Update<br>* Re-worked the map visually, using different textures for over- and underground areas<br>* Improved lighting<br>* Improved player experience for some teleporters<br>* Removed annoying sounds<br>* Improved the surf a little bit<br>* Added bonus3<br>* Added Counter-Strike:Source version<br><br>The Evo2 update is hopefully the last change I make to this map.<br><br>It should feel better to play now, as well as also being available for CSS.<br><br>Being my first map, I learned from this as much as I could and I am now looking forward to bigger and better Projects :)<br><br>CSGO Version: https://gamebanana.com/maps/209033 <br><br><br><br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2OAytl8r9g\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
