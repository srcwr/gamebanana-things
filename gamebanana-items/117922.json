	"_sText": "MADE BY: Xtra-Hoot (panic! at T spawn)\r\n\r\nROOMTACTIK_TEXTURE_B2 is a deathmatch map with multiple routes.  From the spawn players can either go towards the choke point which has been engineered so players cannot be shot coming out of spawn and to engage in combat have to move round the corner  to the enemy, they may also climb the walls of the spawn to  the middle platform which has ladders to another area below which then leads to the map floor.  Taking the other path from spawns, players reach the path at the back where the blocks make it difficult knowing where your enemy is.\r\n\r\nNEW:  \r\n\r\nConverted map to Texture from bricks\r\nAdded middle section\r\nAdded ladders in Spawns\r\nBalanced sizes of walkways\r\nAdded ladders to lower platform and bottom\r\n\r\nTO COME:\r\nSecret room (:O)\r\nUpper walkways"
