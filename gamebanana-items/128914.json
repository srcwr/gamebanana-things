	"_sText": "Mg_stealth_tunnel\r\n\r\nCreated by Drew (PWN3R)\r\n\r\nInspired by breakfloor, this map consists of rows and columns of breakable cubes in which you can create a tunnel to get onto the enemy's side, and kill them. This map is much bigger than breakfloor, giving you more room to create your own secret tunnels or hiding spots. Don't burrow too far; you can fall out the bottom and die!\r\n\r\nThis map looks really nice. By using a 3D skybox, the map appears to be inside a vertical tunnel, which is rendered to be 16 times the maximum possible height of a Source engine map! To add to the atmosphere, this map has some nice HL2 touches, like the combine forcefield and a strider.\r\n\r\nThis map has been fully tested of gameplay exploits, and does not lag servers.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
