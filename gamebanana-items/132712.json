	"_sText": "So this is my first Publiced map, I've made a femap before, but never got around to public it. anyways it's Zm_ruined_construction. It stated out as an prefab, but then i made 3 more and sat it togheter and made a map instead, i think it turned out great. also you can extend it if you want, but don't erase my name (inside the map) also give me cred for the originally one\r\nFor the video---->http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCFm80Gq8uE(in this vid i got another skybox (the zombie one had a few probs), more light in the tunnel, no buildings in the skybox, no name (inside the map))\r\nalso all the planks in this map aren't breakable, DO NOT be worried about hiding with em ;D\r\nIf the download link doesn't work, try this ------->http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VJGHO2JC and plz, subscribe on my youtube channel,\r\nand hopefully this is my final, maybe i make myself an extended version if i get good feedbacks ;D\r\n(got 30 ct spawn and 30 t spawn)\r\nThankz, SauSaGe \r\n\r\n(nodraw)"
