The last person alive shall become the victor!\r\n\r\nWhats new?\r\n------------------\r\nOptimizing was a big part of the final version, so thats what we did, the castle has been recreated, so people may have higher fps near the castle.\r\n\r\nWe also fixed some textures\r\n\r\nNew Project\r\n==================\r\n[HG_Stranded](http://gamebanana.com/projects/34709 \"HG_Stranded\")\r\n\r\n> [Hunger Games Beta TRAILER](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JBKjFgS4cg&feature=youtu.be \"Hunger Games Beta TRAILER\")"
