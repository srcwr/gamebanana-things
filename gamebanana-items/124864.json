The final picture is where I designed the map to have an endbox. The map is still relatively short I didn't really design this map to be hard just a tad challenging and force to you be careful where you jump. For those who like my maps I'm working as hard as ever, even though I'm still fairly new, to create more maps that are just as fun and challenging as I can possible make them for my level of expertise.</p>"
