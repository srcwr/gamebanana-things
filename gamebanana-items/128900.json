Simple right?.\r\n\r\nTo add in some extra fun there are ramps around the map that allow the players to boost off and get to places faster. After 5 minutes into the game scouts will also spawn on the top platforms for players to use\r\n\r\nExtra features include:\r\n-x2 run speed \r\n-Half gravity so its easier to jump with speed.\r\n-Air acceleration (to turn of course).\r\n-A funny looking ball.\r\n-A button that will play music in game.\r\n\r\nAnything else will probably be explained at the start of each round once the map is started.\r\n\r\n"
