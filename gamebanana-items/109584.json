	"_sText": "A small desert map that was designed with all weapons in mind, meaning the AWP has no advantage over the mp5. All the weapons look great with the reflections inside the buildings. A fun map to go play some quick rounds with your friends. The explosive barrels in the middle add for some extra fun if you catch someone off-gaurd. NOTE---for some reason after a reformat my computer wouldnt compile the map again, so as a result, there are a few mistakes I would fix but I can't. Those being the wire spool near the T side being off the ground and, the middle section of the glass in the 2 story building. Thanks for the download!"
