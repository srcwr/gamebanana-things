	"_sText": "This is a remake of mp_barn from SOF2 (All rights reserved - copyright Ravensoft). It's my first CS:S map but I think I did a pretty good job and recieved good feedback during play testing.\r\nThis map is very dynamic because of the use of physics boxes. One HE nade can shift gameplay significantly as boxes get moved around and/or destroyed. I used a work-around to make bumping the boxes and standing on them work rather well. There are some side-effects to this but they just make things more interesting in my opinion.\r\nIt's a relatively small map but supports up to 32 players (I think it rocks one vs one, got up to 8 vs 8 during testing and that was pretty action-packed)\r\nI hope you all enjoy it! Any feedback is appreciated. Also, I'm looking for a good texture artist and modeler to collaborate on other SOF2 remakes with. Drop me a line at phresh@ddkclan.com"
