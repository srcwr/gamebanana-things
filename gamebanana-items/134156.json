I made this map\r\nin approximately 3 days. I made it because the\r\nother gg_trs_churches map was so popular but at\r\nthe same time it had the potential to be so much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n   I didn't like the dulled-down colors of the\r\noriginal churches and also knew it could use alot\r\nmore detail to the environment. I also knew that\r\nthere were other improvements I could make to add\r\nto the fun, and those are listed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW FEATURES\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n** A bomb site in the middle of the map!\r\n** Windows in the interior walls for more action!\r\n** New interior high platform inside each church!\r\n** Shallower, more realistic underground areas!\r\n** Trees, bells, more gravestones, etc.!"
