	"_sText": "Something I made when I was bored. I figure someone could do something with it, maybe a knife arena or something. Be aware that it uses quite a lot of brushes.\r\n\r\nThe version in the download has a 3D skybox too, which isn't shown in the screenshots. You may want to delete that.\r\n\r\nThe skybox should be remade to fit if you are going to use this. I simply made it a box as I was only quickly testing it.\r\n\r\nWater texture is included. Simply drop the materials folder into your cstrike folder. The material is named \"water_flat\"."
