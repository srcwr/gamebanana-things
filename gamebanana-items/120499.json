	"_sText": "  I wanted to make a firing range just too mess around on.. it was first just gonna be a simple little firing range but I decided to make it as realistic as possible to a point. I was watching Mythbusters and they created a chicken gun, that got me thinken, why not make a watermelon launcher, so I did.. Its pretty hard to shoot those watermelons in mid flight, so good luck :D.\r\n\r\n   theres 3 stationary targets that have audio and text when you hit certain parts of the target. Also there is 2 moving targets that go side to side and fall over when you hit em. By the front fence is a switch to bring the targets back up. A little bonus feature I decided to add was 3 cars that blow up when you shoot the red gas cans inside the car, one is hard to find :P.\r\nThe watermelon gun is quite simple theres 3 switches, Load, rotate, and fire. BTW It must be in the vert position to load it or the melons just fall behind it. You can load it all the way to the top but it gets glitchy so be warned. There some bottles on top of the hay stacks on sides by the spawn points as well. I have custom textures for the ground, mountains,some grass sprites and the switches for the watermelon gun plus I redesigned  the militia rocks for the ground. Custom Sounds for the ambient back round, cannon, car explosions ect.\r\n\r\nHave fun !"
