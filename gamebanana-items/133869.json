	"_sText": "This map was inspired by gg_deagle_5 and aim_shotty intended for gungame.  Therefore I cant take total credit for this map.  However I thought the two maps combined in the right way would make for allot of fun.  I did not decompile any maps for this, I just went by memory and also by looking at the maps, so Im sure the dimensions are not to the correct standards of the two maps.  I added different textures to spice things up a little.  I did not go into great detail on this map because I wanted something that played good and would give good fps.  I used Hammer, 20 players and nav file."
