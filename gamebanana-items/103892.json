	"_sText": "De_seasideresort_pro is new Counter-Strike: Source map. The map takes place at a luxury hotel. There are many routes inside the building and possibility to flank from outside to the back of the building. Bomb places are located at opposite sides of the building near the center. Terrorists can choose to either stand back on the backyard or try to rush either of the bomb sites. Counter-terrorists can split forces to guard both bomb places or try to hit the terrorists by rushing from center. There are many passageways in the building, which makes it possible to change plans on-the-run.\r\n\r\nThe map is best played with 16 - 64 players.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CNbBDwml4uw&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CNbBDwml4uw&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nCreated by Ghost.\r\nReleased May 2009.\r\nContact at <a href=\"http://css.setti.info/\">http://css.setti.info</a>"
