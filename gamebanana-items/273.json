I build this as part of a contest with a friend (his result: http://www.blendpolis.de/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=34833 ). \r\nI upload this as a resource for you to take whatever you need for your own maps. Just mention me in your credits. However this map is very detailed and might help you with one or two things (especially the detailed architecture might help when building an industrial map)\r\nJust thought that this was too much work to never show it around…\r\n\r\nPlease note that there will be a lot of missing textures and models. I recommend using other Textures which are included in the game you are working with for smaller file size or see dev. notes.\r\nvmf and bsp for L4d2 included"
