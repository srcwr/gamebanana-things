	"_sText": "This was a map i actually left off about 5 months ago, i just fixed it up, and now it is ready for its BETA version. Please, if you find any holes or uneven walls etc, say it. And i have not added the secret to get the awps, as i do not want people to find out so early. \r\n\r\nI have tried to add a bit more different textures and i need feedback on the amount of weapons (too much or too little). Tell me if i should add more objects into the map. \r\n\r\nOther than that, it is a simple map with a dust environment on top and a snow environment below. Have Fun!\r\n\r\nbtw, if anyone knows why when i start up the map i get a message saying something about the navigation mesh being built on a different version or something, if you could tell me what that means, thanks.
