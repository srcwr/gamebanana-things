Map is big.\r\nLast level of each stage should be harder that usual.\r\nAround map are occasionally helpers (signs, moving laser beam) which show you something useful (especially for newbies).\r\n\r\nWhen you finish map, you can exchange your weapons in white square on the wall and you will get sign over your head and laser beam following you (in hidden stage there are different signs and color of beam you get every level you finish)\r\nYou can reset it in start room if you don't like it.\r\n\r\nStill in beta stage, see div notes.\r\n\r\nMy 1st map so don't kill me."
