	"_sText": "Overview: This map is set around an alley way, set in the still standing City 19. The problem is that the only few surviving humans are stuck here do to the combine's quarantine of the city. The only thing left to do is SURVIVE!.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nGot my inspiration for this map from different areas in HL2. In this map i really tried to focus on game play and looks. . Many of the ZM maps out there are heavy on gameplay but look like crap. Lots of props to throw around, has a very dark feel to it. FLASHLIGHT is YOUR FRIEND! There are 24 spawns scattered all around the map in different areas. You can explore most buildings, V2 hope to make it so you can go in ALL buildings. \r\n\r\nTHis is only version 1 Im going to begin work on version 2 and hopefully fix a few bugs.\r\nThings to do:\r\n*1 Hiding spot left to build\r\n*Certain areas require optimization (although should not affect your game)\r\n\r\nPlease leave feed back and ASSES! \r\n*Note* This map was previously named zm_backalley_intel \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\nThanks to <img src=http://image.hazardstrip.com/banners/studios/mapticaldj8.jpg>\r\nThanks to <img src=http://image.hazardstrip.com/upic/287375.png>(For coming up with the name)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a video teaser of what the map looks like\r\n<object width=\"280\" height=\"220\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.wegame.com/static/flash/player2.swf?tag=zm_backalley_intel_Teaser\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.wegame.com/static/flash/player2.swf?tag=zm_backalley_intel_Teaser\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"280\" height=\"220\"\"></embed></object><div style=\"display: block; font-size: 11px\">Watch more <a href=\"http://www.wegame.com/game/css/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CS Source Videos\">CS Source Videos</a></div>\r\n"
