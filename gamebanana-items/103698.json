The test was successful.  The missle will launch 5 seconds before the end of the three minute game. A mirror map was created around the test.  The map is just on the larger side of things, but compacted into a 5 story arena.  Multiple entry points were created in each room to allow for fast movement, as well as fast, fun gameplay.  There are plenty of sniper points, but all of them can be flanked.  As this is a mirror map, it does not favor one side or the other.\r\n\r\nStoryline:  \r\nScientists are constantly researching new ways to upgrade the aging nuclear stockpile.  While working on the Minuteman II project, terrorist managed to break into the facility.  They know they have no chance of taking the weapons for themselves.  However, if they can blow up the facility, they can send radioactive material into a major metropolitan area.  The results would be disastrous.  Knowing this, the scientists have rig the Minuteman II missile to launch with the warhead unarmed.  If successful, the warhead would fall harmlessly into the sea, and the terrorists would be left with no radioactive material.  The scientists have also arranged a surprise for the terrorists.  They have removed the seal around the silo.  Anyone caught near the silo when it launches will be burnt to a crisp.  Can the counter-terrorists stop the terrorists and save the missile? Will the terrorists claim a great victory over their enemies?  You decide.\r\n\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions:  Save cs_research_silo.bsp to the folder C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\username\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps, where Valve is your installation directory and username is your Steam account username.
