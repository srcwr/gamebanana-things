	"_sText": "This map evolved from one of my older projects. Initially it was a hostage rescue map. But I decided to keep things simpler. Uses assets from BM Source mod and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (SDK version). The school building itself, materials on buildings, asphalt textures as well as a bunch of original graffiti decals are mine. I used the real world photographs I made of a real school in the city of Donetsk. Skybox and env settings were borrowed from cs_havana. 3D skybox is based on standard HL2 assets, so it does not reflect the real location layout.<br><br>This is a beta release, so all comments and suggestions are welcome.<br>"
