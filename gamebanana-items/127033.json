	"_sText": "This is my deathrun map, it is very funny and special, because every CT spawns with a jetpack.\r\nHe can use it by holding left mouse, then he gets an upwards boost.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning the map seems impossible, but after some practise you can beat it under 3 min (or less).\r\n\r\nT's have a improved version of the CTs jetpack\r\n\r\nThis map has 64 CT spawns and 2 T spawns\r\n\r\nIn the end you can choose between Bhop, HE, Knife and Laser duell (and if you are fast enough you can even instantly kill the Ts or go to the Ts region)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun\r\n\r\nPS: I've used this textures http://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/707"
