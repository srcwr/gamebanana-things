This is my first map posted to fpsbanana and I know it can be brutal, so let me hear your remarks.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs for the map, there are numerous hidden teleports into rooms that when cadded properly, would be almost impossible to get into.  I have tried to make the map balanced for zombies and humans.  I plan to make more maps, I just have to learn more processes. "
