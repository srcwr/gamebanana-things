One large building separates the map, and the combat zone is in a small market plaza. Smaller homes litter the outside. Smoke rises from the chimneys and birds chirp in the distance.\r\n============\r\n32slot, soundscape. Enjoy and provide serious and constructive feedback. Thanks to cheebs for Radar Overlay.\r\n============\r\nAfter clicking the download button, i would appreciate you assessing / commenting on my map."
