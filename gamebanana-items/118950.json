I decided that the outcome\r\nis fairly good even though it is a bit small so i \r\nreleased it to the public. The map has a custom start\r\nsound at the terrorists spawn. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Sorry For Lack Of Screenshots. Since i was in a rush while uploading i did not have time to take any so here is some new screenshots."
