Simple as that.\r\nThe map counts how many terrorists there are, and set the difficulty both in weapon and health accordingly.\r\n1-3 terrorist(s) = m249\r\n4-6 terrorists = m4a1\r\n7-9 terrorists = elite\r\n10-12 terrorists = glock\r\n13-14 terrorists = deagle\r\n\"But, deagle is better than glock?\" you say. Not in this game. The more bullets you can throw at the zombies the better. \r\nThe less people the more teamplay is required. And face it, if there are 14 stressed terrorists there wont be much teamplay. lol\r\n\r\nMax : 14terrorists & 2counter-terrorists.\r\nRemember to add these commands:\r\nmp_limitteams 0\r\nmp_autoteambalance 0\r\n\r\nHave fun, comment, and suggest improvements!\r\n\r\nCREDS:\r\nFibbs - Awesome prefab timer I turned into a counter:) \r\n\r\n/Brave\r\n"
