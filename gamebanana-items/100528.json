You are on the top of the m.i.s.a. tower, more specific, in the Gallery known as \"the Junkyard\".\r\n\r\nIn 2050 the world started to recycle everything, so there was no junk of any kind left by 2080. That made junk, which was found in the dephts of the ocean or woods and swamps, extremly valuable to the collector who has everything else. Your first adress would be \"the Junkyard\", established in 2085 the Gallery sells only high class junk.\r\n\r\nOf course valuable stuff always lures some criminals. But the security team has already found out and locked the escalators.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Fight off the security team and watch out for your hostages, they are your only way out know!\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: Your first objective is to rescue the hostages. As for the intruders ...shoot on sight!\r\n\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/171/f/f/mapdetails_by_mikael_hakase-d5456iz.png\">\r\n\r\n- made for Counter-Strike: Source\r\n- cubemaps\r\n- small 3d skybox\r\n- HUD\r\n- NAV\r\n- Custom Textures\r\n- 32 Playerspawns\r\n- Ventsystem\r\n- 4 Hostages to rescue\r\n- All content is packed into BSP\r\n\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/171/9/9/credits_by_mikael_hakase-d5456eu.png\">\r\n\r\nPlease see the \"credits\" Box on the right side. If I forgot to add someone, contact me. I will fix it right away.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/171/5/d/closing_words_by_mikael_hakase-d5456dd.png\">\r\n\r\nWell, what to say. This is my entry for the Junkyard Contest and my second released map. It was made on 3.5 weekends consuming lots of Red Bull and Doctor Who. And its actually the first time I got the HUD to work, so yay for that.\r\n\r\nThe idea is kind of a longshot, but I didn't wanted to do just a \"simple\" junkyard. So thats what I came up with, I hope you like it. As always, feedback is very welcome.\r\n\r\nPlease don't decompile. If you need anything or want to know something about the map, PM me or post a comment. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center> <p class=\"c6\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/039/6/d/logo_klein_sig_by_mikael_hakase-d75omih.png\"></p> </center>"
