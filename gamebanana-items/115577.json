The map is more detailed and the shoutout \"break the floor\" has been revamped. Also, the bottom of the pit has been redesigned. If players somehow survive the drop, they will still die because everybody gets dissolved on the bottom. \r\n\r\nNote that the amount of layers have been reduced from 5 to 4. That is because of an engine error (yay 4 update) and it couldn't stack so many func_breakables anymore.\r\n\r\nThe amount of spawnpoints have been increased to 56. (28 on each team).\r\n\r\nSo go and get your updated version of breakfloor! I hope the breakfloor players are settled for the upcoming year. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nHelix."
