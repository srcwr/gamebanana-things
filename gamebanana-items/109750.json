It's a large arena style map with a twist.  this map has a central core with low gravity.  it's a knife wielding, pistol shooting, sneaking up on them frag-fest.  sometimes you'll get choppy play in the room if your rates and settings aren't right so it's been a decent indicator when someone complains in a server.  \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is a BETA map and let me know if you find any problems with the map so I can fix them for the final release."
