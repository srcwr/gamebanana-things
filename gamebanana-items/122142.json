The prisms are not made obvious, and the emphisis is on exploring and taking in the atmosphere, not for mindless shooting. prolonged investigation will reveal lots of surfing oppurtunity and many secrets.\r\n\r\nTeams spawn in the hands of a massive statue, built into a dormant volcano. Explore the temples and ruins of a dead race and whisper into the ears of the ruined god statues. They will help you on your way.\r\n\r\nMade for 66 tick, will work for 100.\r\n\r\nvisit solidsurf.info"
