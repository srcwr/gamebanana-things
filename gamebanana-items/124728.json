	"_sText": "So this map didn't take near as long as I thought it was going to. Was planning on it being like a month long project but it only took about a week.<br><br>The gameplay style is a lot different from my normal style. Its more of a tradition bhop map than my normal surf hybrid maps. The map is about 2 minutes on a casual run but there is &nbsp;plenty of skips and optimizations to be made.<br><br>There is one small bonus. Just make sure you put the start zone within the corridor or it may be breakable."
