Version 2 has been on the server for a long time now and I wanted to update it with new geometry and make it look nicer. Also took some feedback from players and implemented them.\r\n\r\nThe map is mostly Dev Textures, because I really cannot texture, but found that when playing with textures the underground lost the golden light and I thought that looked nice, so kept the default Orange Dev Texture to achieve it.\r\n\r\nPlayers: 30\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528. Thanks for the textures.\r\n\r\nCustom Textures and Nav file included"
