The CT's have to shoot down the T's in mid air.\r\n\r\nThere is a HE vending machine in T spawn to make it easier for the T's to pick up grenades and go again.\r\n\r\nThere are 10 CT slots and 16 T slots to allow to try and balance the teams, this map was designed for a 20 slot server.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to [RuMe] Impossible for retexturing my map!\r\n\r\nCheck us out at www.steamgamers.com\r\n\r\nThe map is running on the following servers:\r\nMiniGames Funtastic {66.135.43.185:27016} \r\n\r\nFinal Version: I remade the map from start, its pretty much similar but looks alot nicer on the eye. \r\n\r\nFinal_Improved: The map was retextured thanks to [RuMe] Impossible! Big thank you to him!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
