	"_sText": "IMPORTANT! READ THIS!\r\n\r\n**UPDATE: Map version 2 Will be Availible soon.**\r\n\r\nThis is my VERY first map I ever created. It is a Zombie map. I would not really recomend it for anything else.\r\nSince this is a zombie map,  (and my first map) it does not have a custom made nav file, so the bots can be a bit stupid sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe zombies cannot leave spawn area, you must make your way to them & open the door that lets the zombies out.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE MAP:\r\nthe map itself is a series of zombie maps to come. Basicly, the maps are different parts of a giant facility, this part will be the office part of the facility, where the people who have no idea whats going on below work.\r\nThe other parts will be a recycling facility, Labs, Chemical storage, and power.\r\n\r\nI will also modify the maps to be playable in Hl2 single player mode.\r\nthese will be the map names:\r\n\r\nInfiltration (lvl1)\r\nGreenhouse (lvl2)\r\nNightmare (lvl3)\r\nUnder the Rug (lvl4)\r\nNight light (lvl5)\r\nEscape (lvl1 modifyed)\r\n\r\nThe best part of this map that I think is the secret. \r\n\r\nthe secret is a safe room where no zombie can possibly get to you. (or unfortunatly you get to him) I call it the \"Chill room\"\r\n\r\nBe prepared to get frustraited with getting to it without no clip mode on, cuz its VERY difficult!"
