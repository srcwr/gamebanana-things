	"_sText": "My first actual bhop map, as well as my first map ever released, don't expect anything amazing. That being said, keep the hateful comments to a minimum because I'm aware the map isn't great. \r\n\r\nHad fun mapping it and learned a lot in the process, hope you'll enjoy the gameplay. Map is about 25sec on auto.\r\n\r\nNote: the map is called oldstyle because it uses 'vanilla' textures as seen in a lot of older bunnyhop maps. If I ever learn how to use Hammer more efficiently I may release a better looking map in the future. There's also no mpbhop triggers, but as I stated earlier it's a fast-paced map intended for auto so they're pretty irrelevant. \r\n\r\nNote2: The telehop is backwards. When I mentioned I was going to fix that, people told me not to, as a result I just left it as is."
