The map is using dust and Aztec textures, as you can see on the images. This map does not have HDR as i felt that it was not needed. I have Nodrawed EVERY thing that you cannot see while playing, so I think your FPS will be pretty high even if your comp is shit. The map has 32 player spawns, now there is just one thing left to say, I hope you like it!"
