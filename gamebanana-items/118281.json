	"_sText": "It's been a while since i've made an awp map and I figured i've gotten a lot more skilled in mapping since the last awp map i've made, so i'd make another. I made it but it had some major problems, so I had Nosoul (member of danger zone studios) take a look at it, he optimized the map, which fixed the problem. So, here's the map, finished and everything. And out of all the maps i've made, this one was probably the biggest pain in the ass i've ever had. So I hope you all like it. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I want to give a special thanks to Nosoul who made my map actually playable!"
