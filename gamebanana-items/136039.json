This is my first map for CSS, and i decided to share it with the great FPSB! :D This map is really for GG, but AIM is welcome too :) Have fun guys!\r\n\r\n                    .:=Installation=:.\r\n       To install, simply put the .bsp in your counterstrike-source/maps folder and you're set :D\r\n\r\nEDIT: Yes, i know in some of the screenies the orange walls have a hole in them and in others they dont, i apologize. I took some screenshots before returning to Hammer and after, so i got them a little mixed up. When you download this map, there WILL be a hole in the orange walls so that you may walk through them."
