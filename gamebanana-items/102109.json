	"_sText": "This is a small-medium defuse map with a\r\nsingle bomb spot. The layout is roughly based on a plain looking, little known\r\nmap from 10 years ago called de_dust_small. I did make quite significant layout\r\nchanges by adding a bunch of new pathways including an underground section and\r\nalso improved the aesthetics a lot. But I still kept the name to honour the\r\nwork of the original creator. <o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nHeres a link to the original map <o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nhttps://gamebanana.com/maps/99960<o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile the map didn’t look like much I quite\r\nliked the unique gameplay that plays somewhat similar to csgos new retake mode.&nbsp;<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn this map the Ts start closer to the\r\nbombspot than the CTs and are virtually guaranteed to be able plant the bomb\r\n(if they rush). Its then on the CTs to find a way to retake the spot. As you\r\ncan see from the overview there are roughly 4-5 different routes the CTS can\r\ntake and the Ts have to defend – as to not make it too easy for the Ts. The\r\nbomb timer is also extended to 50s to make time a little issue for the CTs. Its\r\nmore about skill , positioning and tactics. <o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nGiven the 4-5 different paths which can each\r\neasily hold 2-3 player from each team the map is best played with more than 12&nbsp; players for the full potential but the map is\r\nalso small enough to play some fast paced 1v1s or 2v2s if you like – although I\r\nsuspect the retake aspect will be off little importance then. <o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nHave fun<o:p></o:p><br><br>PS: dont go all forensic on me about the visual style ; ) I know the map is not really culturally accurate. Its more a blend of different asian cultures and building style that I created mostly off the top of my head.&nbsp;"
