This is actually my first real map, so i decided to \"release\" it (you gotta start with something anyway).\r\n\r\nCONTENT:\r\nBasically, this is a not too big bomb defuse map. Each side (T and CT) starts in a house, located on an open area, separated by a tall wall. They must both make their way to the bomb site first.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\nThis map has realistic lighting. It contain some static and moveable props, as well as breakable glass and ladders.\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nAll credit goes to me. I made this map on my own, and when i gain more experience in mapping, i will form a group to make bigger an better maps.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nIf you have any tips, comments,... feel free to tell me! You will help me in making better maps."
