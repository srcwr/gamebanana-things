To break the jail you should break the thing under it which is holding the jail!)\r\nBoards which are thrown through the crates, as well as to the fortress, and from her, can be broken!\r\nMap made specially for a server \"clan by[Zombie Attack]...\"\r\nIf you put it on your server, please inform me about it!"
