	"_sText": "Updated to version _v2k!\r\nChanged and built new routes on this one.\r\n\r\nSo, here it is final version of telakka. I made couple major changes on this map, but the original layout is very same as beta had. \r\n\r\nChanges: CT base has moved in different location, underground tunnels has been extended, and so on.\r\n\r\nHope everything is good now with this one but never can be so sure is map bug free or not. If you find bug or something else is not right please contact me so i can fix those in v2 on later.\r\n\r\nMap designed by Hakk1tus Mar 17th 2010\r\nContact: hakkitus@hotmail.com (contact in case of problems or questions concerning the map)\r\nIRC: Quakenet #pelipurkki, #Pirates"
