I ended up not only replacing the textures, but doing major edits to the lighting and making a couple of structural changes.\r\n\r\nNon-Texture Based Changes From Original Pink Panther include ladders to access the top, torches in the underground areas for lighting, and some minor structural changes for visual improvement.\r\n\r\nThe torch prefab I made for this project can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3803 \">http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3803 </a>\r\n\r\nThis map can be found on the mfcgaming.net Reverse Gungame5 Elimination Server @ 69.39.229.49:27015\r\n\r\nThe rar file contains the map and nav files as well as bzip version of both for fastdl servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease play the map, rate and comment. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
