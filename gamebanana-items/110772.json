Throw the nades over the wall in the middle to kill. Use the boxes and the small platform to help you.\r\n60 Spawnpoints (recommended 20 players max.)\r\nYou spawn with 1 HE and 1 knife.\r\nThis is the first version. There may be places that needs improvement. You can send suggestions/comments to cs_akman@yahoo.com.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: 60 Players in this map will be too much. About 20 would be nice.\r\n"
