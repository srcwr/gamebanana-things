	"_sText": "Scouthouse\r\nI designed this map for LAN parties.\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\nA basic 2 house map divided by a canyon.\r\nOne scout rests just in front of the spawn while 3 extras are inside the second floor.\r\nThere is a large sum of flash bangs and smoke grenades on the second floor as well.\r\nThree platforms separate the map making it difficult but not impossible to cross.\r\nAMBIENT_SOUND! If you fall into the canyon you will hear a scream. Contributes to lol factor.\r\nA skybox surrounds the map.\r\nLighting illuminates the map as if you were positioned in a canyon.\r\nThis map provides short fast paced gameplay depending on your skill level.\r\nSoundscape.\r\n12 Slot.\r\nMedium Size.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\nRecommended 2 or 4 players.\r\nMaking the map easy on the eyes was critical to scouts.\r\nChances are I will release more of this type of map, do to good release at LAN party.\r\nI do not recommend this for a server besides LAN because of few slots, and extremely fast gameplay.\r\n\r\nAssessing:\r\nPlease do not assess if you have not downloaded and play tested with a friend, but i really do appreciate you assessing. If you do asses please do it on these bases. Ambience: How it sounds. Detail: of the map. Fun: How much you had while playing. Looks: How easy was it on your eyes?\r\nEnjoy"
