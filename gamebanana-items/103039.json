Each battle has a tonne of \r\nexcitement. \r\n\r\nRemember the 2 hidden stashes placed strategically, \r\nhelp you when your in need of some edge. \r\n\r\ni personally didn't like  the 2 textures approach to a map\r\nso i added some masks, natural lighting, and light effects.\r\ni hope the architexture is enjoyable. the frates on mine were \r\nstill great, 60+\r\n\r\nof course they go down the more peeps get on... but i comfortably ran 29 peeps, with minimal pc slowage.\r\n\r\nP4 3000mhz, 128 sapphire vid card 9600 1gig ram\r\n\r\nplease rate this map...\r\nplease post comments...\r\nplease say no to greenhouse emissions!!!"
