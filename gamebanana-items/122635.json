	"_sText": "This is a tier 4/5 linear map that is about 1:20 minutes long. The map has a lot of flat, fast jumps with some vertical sections to break it up. The main character of the surf is a lot of fast, acrobatics sections with many turns and smooth ramp entrances. The central mechanic of the map is using landmark teleports to increase your speed in a section in order to progress. This also links in with the futuristic theme. \r\n\r\n  There are two bonuses which are about the same difficulty. One of the bonuses is a straight forward surf that uses more conventional challenges. The other bonus plays with the teleport mechanic as a central part of the challenge.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to Morning, Nyastle, and Niyhm for making the video:\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JUpmB2JFKAE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nGive it a try and tell me what you think!\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the CSGO version:\r\nhttp://csgo.gamebanana.com/maps/186134"
