	"_sText": "Pretty small and fast paced gameplay. Nav included for convenience, load it up and test. There are quite a few options with gameplay, several pathway connections allow for the other team to 'sneak up' on you planting the bomb/defending the bombsite, although a few places may be seen as 'campsites' they are generally pretty useless and defenceless...allowing for the fast gameplay.\r\n\r\n<b>Background</b>\r\n\r\nA historical site surrounded by modernised housing has been targeted by environmental terrorists. As time progressed, the area has become much more modern, hence the swimming pool etc...\r\nIt's a small map with a \"fast and furious\" gameplay."
