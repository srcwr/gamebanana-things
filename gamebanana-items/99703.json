My next step\r\nis to create a lot of custom models and textures to fully realize the vision I had for this map.\r\nPlease enjoy and provide any feedback via the maps ongoing thread at \r\n\r\nhttp://www.interlopers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14049\r\n\r\nor drop me an email at\r\n\r\nacapulcogold20@bluebottle.com\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Stokes"
