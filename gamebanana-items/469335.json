This map has a lot of similarities to No Mercy's first map. In this prototype, there are a whopping 99 CT \"zombie\" spawnpoints compared to a mere 10 for the Terrorists (standing in for \"survivors/humans\") fighting knife-only CTs. This idea can still be seen in&nbsp;<i>Left 4 Dead</i>'s unused strings mentioning this."
