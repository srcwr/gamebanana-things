There are custom texures, 2 secrects ..plenty of stores to hide in or either find some camping spot ... I plan to add more stores, and more zombie camping zones when I get enough feedback through the public\r\n-----------------------\r\nCredits to :\r\nRenguard for his store contribue\r\nGHS Clan for testing the map\r\n\r\nIf any problems such as missing textures please pm me..\r\nI Pakrat all textures\r\n-------------------------\r\nWell thats about all right now\r\nHave fun\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nMaybe in final verison I will add a seconod floor idk.if it will be good or not....\r\nOne more thing.. If you want to add a store to the mall I am willing to take anyone vmf as long as its reasonable\r\nPM for dimesions and rules."
