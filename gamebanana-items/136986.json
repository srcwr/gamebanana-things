All of which will be just thrown together, they won't have any specific layout, i'll just add stuff as I go through making the map until I'm happy with it, at which time I will submit it as a map to download. \r\n\r\nThis one is full of places to go and many ways to get there. It is almost perfectly symetical so the teamplay is excellent.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it!"
