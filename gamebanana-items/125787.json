Start zone is entirety of the green texture, end zone is entirety of red texture. There's not much for me to say about this map. This map IS another oneshot map, following in the style of my previous two maps. I may make a checkpoint/stage map in the future, but not right now.&nbsp;<br><br>Length: 17.44 - 50 seconds (Shiwuzhi's request)<br>Difficulty: Nearly Impossible (As shiwuzhi played it)<br><br>Thanks to Blank Bhop Server for hosting my prototype and for giving me ideas! Feel free to check them out.<br><br>Edit: Shiwuzhi told me to put him in the map description if he was the first to finish on Blank Bhop. Here ya go shiwu."
