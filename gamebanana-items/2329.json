Then i did it and here we are. Now your prolly wondering, wtf? Well, There is a button at the end of the \"house\" and if you press that button an alarm goes off, and all the windows are covered by thick metal \"walls\" so no one can get in or out. Then, the lights go off, and red lights make slow strobes. This is great for any map but zm in particular. Enjoi!\r\n\r\n-[F]ox"
