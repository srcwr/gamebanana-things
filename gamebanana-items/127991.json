	"_sText": "I've been working on this map from time to time. Thought I'd release it now, or I'd probably never finish it. :)\r\n\r\nIt's a multigame map consisting of 10 different games: <p>\r\n- AWP <p>\r\n- Smoke <p>\r\n- Knife <p>\r\n- Bhop <p>\r\n- Iceskate <p>\r\n- Slide <p>\r\n- Race <p>\r\n- Climb (I'll probably alter this one, none of my friends managed to finish it) <p>\r\n- Tetris <p>\r\n- Buy <p>\r\n\r\nI'd say the skill level is probably somewhat higher on this map compared to the most played multigame maps. I've tried to design the maps with the philosophy of \"hard, but not impossible\". Not really happy with the end result, but, oh well. I hope some will like it.\r\n\r\nIf there's any acute bugs that need fixing, give a shout in the comments. I'll probably make a new version some other time, adding a few more maps."
