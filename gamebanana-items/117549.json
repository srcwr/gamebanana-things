All song credits goes to their rightful newgrounds.com authors.\r\n\r\n4 Ramps will toggle every minute, opening and closing, so you get two different experiences with and without the ramp.\r\n\r\nBuytime has been setup to 5 minutes as default time per round.\r\n\r\nAiraccelerate has been changed to 500 in order to have the maximum fun. On top of this, sv_enablebunnyhopping, sv_enableboost has been set to true.\r\n\r\nBombsite has been added so map resets when the time runs out when there are enough players. However, C4 cannot be planted at the bombsite.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Comments/Bug? Leave them here!\r\nPlease Rate and explain, thank you very much!"
