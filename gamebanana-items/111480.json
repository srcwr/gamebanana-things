It's got skybox and proper\r\nlighting, added nodraw to every point of the map i could for best fps.\r\nIt's has cubemaps and a little bit of wind to make it a bit more realistic.\r\nTextures are standard but look great in my opinion, tried to add HDR\r\nbut it turned guns a funny green colour plus it was just to bright!\r\nAnyway this is just the start of mapping for me and will be making\r\nmore maps of every kind in the near future.\r\n\r\nI made this map from scratch and did NOT remake fy_poolparty!\r\nI made a nav aswell because i see alot of people bitchin\r\nabout maps without nav's(o.0)\r\n\r\nCredit to chillinut: model bird prefab(\" Thanks for that :D \")\r\n\r\n.:Have Fun:."
