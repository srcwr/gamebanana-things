I realize that including music in a CS map is generally regarded as an unpopular choice, but I believe it adds a nice synth-heavy and icy ambiance to the level's snowflaky and crystalline layout.  If you don't like it, bind a key to \"stopsound.\"  I'd appreciate those of you who rate the map to base your ratings on the map's gameplay merits and uniqueness, and not let your (poor) taste in music influence you."
