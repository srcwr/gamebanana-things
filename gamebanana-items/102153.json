	"_sText": "This map is an extended version of valves de_dust. The reason i did this was because valves dust gave a campfest and didnt support enough players. Because i extended the map it now easily handles 64 players while allowing the T's to plant the bomb often enough also. The map has working overviews and a nav file.\r\n\r\nThe following features are added:\r\n\r\n- A side route above the bridge.\r\n- A sewer leading to a garage in site A.\r\n- The sewer also has an exit inside a buildings between site A and B.\r\n- A side route at the bridge (sewer also ends here).\r\n- A side route in the temple.\r\n- And some tiny gameplay changes.\r\n- Redone HDR\r\n\r\n<B>Note: Since the map is extended lower player counts could give some unbalance or make the map feel empty</B>\r\n\r\nMap is done by me (Alias |UKCS|)\r\nOverview is done by Nelsaidi (aka. LG |UKCS|)\r\nBeta testing is supported by UKCS (special thanks to TC and LD for making it possible)"
