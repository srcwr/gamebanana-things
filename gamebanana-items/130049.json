The map can farm for you around 8 hostages/10sec\r\nCalculations; 500 hostages in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nAlways use the map \"farm_purifier\" to remove any annoying commands that get stuck to your console after farming.\r\n\r\nNow, grab some snack and enjoy the show. I'd advice you not to AFK for more than 15 minutes;\r\nThe map might glitch and/or your stats get to exaggerated.\r\n\r\n!!!These maps do NOT work on dedicated servers, only local servers hosted by the person farming!!!"
