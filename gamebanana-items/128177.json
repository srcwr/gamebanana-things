	"_sText": "You get spawned in a glass box with a knife and a usp. You break the glass and fall onto a platform. A trigger_once activates a timer and the rotating object. If you survive long enough you get teleported to the space and lava room. Your speed increases in that room and you can pick up grenades and a deagle and kill each other. Also the grenades and the deagle have env_spritetrails on them!! (they leave trails of light on them)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nJamis (owner of DCU servers) thought for the space THEME for the map. He didnt create it he thought about it, and it was a great idea so thank you.\r\nGo to Jamis's Mini-Game server=\r\n69.162.125.212:27015\r\n\r\nThe banner in the space part of the map says DC Universe, this map is dedicated to Jamis and his servers (mainly). His clan is called DC Universe\r\n\r\n\\_\\_\\_|\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_|\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_|\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_|\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_|\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_|\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\r\nIMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!\r\nFor people to download this map, you need a server command !!! =\r\nnet_maxfilesize 100 (default is 16 mb) the map is over 16 mbs."
