	"_sText": "This is my second map; the first being this map with only the cross center piece.\r\n\r\nAs I recall, I added 12 spawns on each side. The map does not play well as a deathmatch map due to the spawn locations, unless they are modified.\r\n\r\nEdit: I believe the map is using skyboxes. However, after compiling another build today, I realized there was an issue with skyboxes and hdr (which I removed).\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Here's the latest build of gg_sl_cross3: (redacted).\r\nIn this map, I changed the skybox, slightly altered lighting (brightness), and added a part to the map to give players more variety. (And added more spawn points--16 on each side.) I would like to add moving clouds, and maybe some other spice."
