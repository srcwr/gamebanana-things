	"_sText": "Cts start off in a bunker and T's start off on the opposite end. The T's attack and can right click with their knife to spawn a shield once per round infront of them. This map depends on terrorist teamplay and can be lots of fun tactically. If the T's make it to the opposite end they can press a button to nuke the cts bunker, or they could just shoot all the cts. Its set up for 16 T 10 Ct with an 8 to 5 suggested T to CT ratio. (Can't add anymore spawns due to sdk limits on the shields sorry.)\r\n\r\nSet for up to 26 spawns- Plays best with more people\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here at Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect.."
