It contains two new stunningly fun game elements that can be played in stead of evil simon:\r\n\r\nRed Light, Green Light: Get to the wall as fast as possible when the light is green. When it turns red (by hands of the ct) freeze! If someone moves while it's red light, they die. Last one at the wall dies.\r\n\r\nMusical Chairs: When the music stops playing, T's have to get their hands on a seat, the one that doesn't, dies... Seat numbers become less when the group is lessened.\r\n\r\nOther basic hosties material:\r\n-Guntoss\r\n-Shot 4 shot\r\n-Simon Wall\r\n-Secret Way\r\n-Race\r\n-Mantoss (new)\r\n-Jails 2x\r\n-Gas Chambre"
