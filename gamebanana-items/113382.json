I feel it didn't earn enough downloads the first attempt. All the textures I used are made by myself. In the middle of the map is a spinning ventilator which can be used to get to the other side of the map faster.\r\n\r\n**HAVE FUN !**\r\n**Features**\r\n==================\r\n- Custom Textures\r\n- Rotating Fan\r\n- Rope Bridge\r\n- HDR\r\n- Soundscape\r\n- Overview (Minimap) \r\n- Custom Skybox \r\n- **OPTIMISATION** \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n==================\r\nTo install this map just copy the .bsp file inside the map to: \\Steam\\steamapps\\STEAM USER ID\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\\"
