I tried my best!*\r\n\r\nSpawns: 32 (16 t, 16 ct)\r\nJails: 2 jails, 2 net traps that could be used as small jails, 1 milk glass (jail)\r\nShot4shot? yes\r\nGun toss? yes\r\nRace? no\r\nArena? no\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n*The terrorists spawn in the spaceship, which crashes on the planet cookie.\r\n*After the crash, a hole will be made in the wall (rebel way)\r\n*There are UFOs flying around the map, some of them will pick you up and give you a ride\r\n*2 net traps, will close when touching/pressing/shooting the stick\r\n*A launcher which sends you very far up in the air, surely breaks your bones\r\n*Milk glass, works as jail\r\n\r\nPICTURES\r\n1. View from simon wall\r\n2. View from above\r\n3. View from a spinning tower thingie\r\n4. View from behind simon wall\r\n5. The launcher, enter it to be launched real far up in the air (a trap)\r\n6. The map\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nEastSider, for pakratting the map and for support\r\nkaratek√§fer, for his awesome skybox\r\n\r\nHeres a video that shows how the map looks like:\r\nNOTE: the skybox is unchanged there since the vid is old\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrdPnCrk-Qw&feature=channel_page"
