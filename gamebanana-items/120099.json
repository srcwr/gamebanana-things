	"_sText": "I designed this map for use with Gun Game, but it does contain buy zones so you don't need the GG mod to play it. This map does not have hostage/rescue or bomb/defuse goals. It is a player vs. player map that plays well (according to my play testers) with many players.\r\n\r\nThe teleports will transport players into the opposing side's spawn area but features a moving exit point so opposing team \"campers\" have a harder time predicting orgin of entry. Visual inspiration comes from gg_circular by Rokusho39.\r\n\r\nThe zip file contains the bspzip file which has textures and bot nav file."
