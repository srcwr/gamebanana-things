Their new aim is to do as much damage as possible using \"Clashpoints\" under some of the area's buildings.\r\n\r\nThere are two clashpoints on this map:\r\n1) There is a clashpoint in a small office close to the Docklands tower. This is located at the base of the Canary Wharf building.\r\n2) There is a warehouse that hosts a lot of documents to which could also be destroyed in order to bring about a long financial halt. This could also be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs with any \"de_\" map, the terrorists are the ones with the explosives, the the counter-terrorists are out to stop them.\r\n\r\nI've also added a secret access area which has reasonable access from both terrorists and counter terrorists. It's not very obvious, but it's quite rewarding. If you manage to find this out then you can tell me about it, studio@sixdimensional.com - well done."
