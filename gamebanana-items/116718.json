	"_sText": "The trap maps, as I call them, are maps where two teams are thrown into a maze-like map filled with concealed traps.\r\n\r\ntrap_catacombs is a dark and scary map where players need to eliminate their opposing team before the traps do. There are about 30 different traps in the map, and a scary theme to it. If you like new ideas and interesting concepts, this map is for you!\r\nI've worked on it for quite a while and finally made a nice finished product. Even a few servers have that map in their lists! This is a great addition to any custom-map server. I've had a lot of feedback and took ideas given to me by other players to add more traps!\r\n\r\nDon't judge this map by the screenshots, you'll need to play it to really judge it!"
