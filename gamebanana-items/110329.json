But enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis map is a large room with cylindrical ladders everywhere.  Jump from ladder to ladder to knife the other team.  It's tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of it.  (No pun intended, and by that, I mean totally pun intended, teeheehee)\r\n\r\n*NOTE* Sometimes you may get stuck on one of the ladders.  But you should be able to jump off of it.  Sometimes it sems inpossible, but it's not.  I can do it.  Sometimes it's easier to do it by strafing and jumping."
