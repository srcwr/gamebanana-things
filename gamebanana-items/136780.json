	"_sText": "Hey folks, this is my newest, latest map. It is a large-ish map compared to some other gungame maps. it consists of 2 floors and 3 main areas which are, the outer ring, the inner room, ad the underground laser tag area. The outer ring consists of boxes and stairs used for maneuvering and for finding cover, the inner building is for quick rushes and fast firefights, and the underground laser tag area is for close quarters combat and unsuspecting knife kills from behind. It can hold up to 24 players. Thank you for checking out my map and I hope you enjoy this as well as my other maps :) Please rate and leave comments below and don't for get to download!"
