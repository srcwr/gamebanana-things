I've taken out the tubes so no more tube camping, I've made realistic roofs and made all doors the correct sizes. I've added as much as I could to increase fps, but still in some spots it's still not the best. I've added some better looking stairs, and added a sun. \r\n\r\nThere is one secret room, but I can't tell where ;)\r\n\r\n<strong>Please don't just say \"eh, it's another remake,\" try it for yourself!</strong>\r\n\r\n<del>We have the map on our server rotation and it's beta, so come check it out:\r\n<strong>208.167.247.61:27015</strong></del>\r\n\r\nHere's a short video showing more of the map:\r\n\r\n<embed width=\"448\" height=\"361\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://i97.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid97.photobucket.com/albums/l232/ICECOLD_3000/zm_lila_panic_vnv.flv\"></embed>\r\n\r\n<b class=\"green\">EDIT:</b> It also includes an awesome radar overview!</font>"
