	"_sText": "This fy map rocks, it looks original, it has low fps, its a quick download and the game play is insain supporting up to 64 people. You spawn with weapons, or you can buy them. Not only that kids. The center of the map has a reactor that rotates that you can jump into and have fun in. The sound files are nifty too. This map was made mainly for team FUK's server. But this is worth using on your server....Delete fy iceworld version 1231112 and use this one. You will not regret it. I promised myself never to make a fy map, but this one is just turned out sweet. So here you go public. enjoy. Oh yeah, Valve, why can't we add ammo to our guns for fy maps? *7%@ers!"
