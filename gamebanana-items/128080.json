It was inspired by lethal weapon 2.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively straightforward.\r\n\r\nI used the helicopter prefab made by smurfii and jj45.\r\n\r\nAlso, i have a problem with the top of one of the houses, which projects weird shadows and looks dark unless looked at directly, all help resolving this is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the archive is the readme i use next to the team select screen. Im not sure if its in the map, but if it isnt, put it in the maps directory"
