I intend to create a jail version of the map for regular surf servers soon.\n\n*Original Post*\n\nI'm being honest with you, this is my first map released. I am VERY proud of this map, because it has taken me over a month, and over 7 keyboard and 2 monitors.\n\nThis map is BIG. I didn't save the log, but I have used over 98% of the brushsides allowed and over 90% of brushes.\n\nThere is roughly 1:30-2minutesof surfing here, and THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE A HARD MAP. Yes, the end is difficult, but that is meant to be the ONLY hard area.\n\nI am not completely satisfied that this is worthy of a full release, so I'm just gonna call this beta1 :P\n\nI would like to point out that this map is FULLY optimised! EVERYTHING apart from the skyboxes has been func_detail'd! This map is as optimized as it ever will be. If anyone wants to have a crack at optimizeign the map further, PM me for the .vmf\n\nAny bugs you find please tell me, and any feedback whatsoever is great.\n\nHave fun and tell me what you think :D"
