Like in the first version red light means porter to T and blue porter to CT and as addition I have added letters in front of the porter. Green means porter to the new Top layer.\r\n\r\nI have added a jail, you can escape from there if you hit the target in front of you with a smoke grenade.\r\n\r\nAlso I have added some secrets, two hidden buyzones and an adminroom wich can be reached by activating 4 buttons.\r\n\r\nLike in the previous version the fall damage is turned off. \r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy playing the map, if you put the map on your server it would be cool if you post your IP here ^^\r\n\r\nPetersilie Superserver ( War / Surf ) 62.75.175.7:27015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: Forgot to mention I am sorry for the big IP, but without the sign you would be able to see the admin room\r\n\r\nVideo: <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RQ2x0RIorg4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
