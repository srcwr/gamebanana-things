Anyway hoping to fix all these bugs, and make the map look even more realistic in version 2, which also will be quite bigger, because i am aware that it's a rather small map.\r\n\r\n-The idea of the map is to create the sort of mountain atmosphere, and i'm still working on getting, that part right \r\n\r\n-Version 2\r\n\r\nIn the next Version i would like to try and fix teh invis wall bug, and some shadow bugs, also i'll make the map bigger, more realistic with more props and make it so you don't look directly down into the skybox, so it looks 3x times more realistic.\r\n\r\nThis map was made by The_wah(IRL Jeppe)"
