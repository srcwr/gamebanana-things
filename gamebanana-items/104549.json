Stayed true to the original layout. Nearly all the old angles are still there. Changed a few secrets, and added a few more. Most changes to the map are purely visual.\r\n\r\nIslamic extremists have targeted Sin City for their next strike against the American way of life. Hoping to further cripple the US economy, a string of attacks have been coordinated and executed in the fabulous city of Las Vegas, Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the strikes increase as the CT's initial response teams quickly become overwhelmed, effectively turning Las Vegas into a war zone.\r\n\r\nYour squad has been assigned to respond to an unidentified helicopter landing at the High Times Hotel & Casino, the sight of an earlier attack which claimed the lives of several of your fellow agents.\r\n\r\nHomeland Security has identified the strike and confirmed that the terrorist have two probable objectives that they are likely to attempt to destroy.\r\n\r\n<B>Target A:</B> As a moral statement, the terrorists have been detonating bombs at strip clubs across the city all night. It is suspected that the High Times Lounge will be the next club to be hit. The club is identifiable by the large Sphinx statue outside of its entrance.\r\n\r\n<B>Target B:</B> The previous attack at this location was a failed effort to empty the casino's vault. It is probable that this second attack is an attempt to finish the job. Allowing the terrorists to escape the scene with the funds is unacceptable. Secure & hold the vault!\r\n\r\n<B>Additional Credits:</B><br>\r\nAll the beta testers on the [DoP] High Times server for finding & putting up with all the terrible bugs & giving valuable feedback. [DoP] Vulgar for letting all that happen. All the people from other forums that helped me fix those bugs (FPSBanana, Interlopers). The authors of GMOW v3 Solid_Granite, GiGaBiTe. All the creators of the original de\\_vegas. And, lastly, VALVE for creating a sweet game/engine/resources that I could work with.\r\n\r\n<B>Original Map Credits:</B><br>\r\nOriginally created by +Cadaver+, textures by George\\_Pooshoes and JOeSmOe.<br> Additional credits to Macman, Chaos, Tech3D, Jubilee, and Agent Orange.\r\n\r\n=====================<br>\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"yellow\"><B>NAVIGATION FILE (.nav)</B></FONT><br>\r\n=====================<br>\r\nCredits for the .nav file go to <A HREF=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/55178\">chizbone</A>.
