	"_sText": "This is my first serious map i really wanted to make since I liked the environement. The idea came from the movie 127 hours I wanted to make people feel the tightness (is that a word?).\r\n\r\n When I tried this map for the first time I had a though about the movie 300 too, when they are facing the perssian army at the reg gate (Don't know if it's the correct name). What happened is that zombies were on 1 side of the map and the human on the other. The zombies made a push to enter into the human places and ate them :p\r\n\r\n Well that was my little emotional moment :p\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map and for any suggestion/personnal feedback here is my steam username : Meg. Feel free to add me :D\r\n\r\nTook me about 4 days to reach this version.\r\n\r\nMap tested on Elite Hunterz server IP : 85.114.140.30:27045 \r\nYou may get stuck in the displacement, I'll try to fix as many as possible in future releases. Custom skybox, the gameplay is kinda balanced, I tried to optimize the map as much as possible but i'm not very good at it."
