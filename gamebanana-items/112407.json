The map is intended to be a short game, no longer than 2 minutes, and the other team isn't intended to cross the bridge.  They hide behind their brick walls and venture to their other areas. I haven't found any glitches so far but any recommendations are useful. There is work going on for an extra dimmension, the 'sewers' and basements etc. but i have other ideas and so it has been shunted to the back of the que."
