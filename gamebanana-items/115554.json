Bossfight map\r\n\r\nIt has 4 difficult settings.\r\nEasy\r\nMedium\r\nHard\r\nHardcore\r\n\r\nyou gain access to hard if you beat medium\r\nand hardcore if you beat hard\r\n\r\nMap has spawnkiller\r\nSecret nades\r\nHP scales with amount of players\r\nBoss is a complete remake from Terranigma an old snes game. The lobby room from Pic 1 is also a 3d remake from a room in this game\r\n\r\nThis release is already V3 because V1 had bugs when tested and V2 Boss was extreme unbalanced\r\nSo boss got nerved hard in V3\r\nBoss seems easy to kill alone but on servers it get harder\r\n\r\nThere are 40 Spawns but 20 Players should be the maximum\r\nBecause more than 20makes Teamfight impossible (everyone do what he wants)\r\n\r\nIn future things that a Bossfight server would need is:\r\nMoney giver like in ZE\r\nRestrict Flash nades and smoke nades\r\nAnd disalow spawning when dead (even if spawnkiller autokills them, the spawning still takes serverpower\r\n\r\nA server with 2 x 20 people or better 4 x 10 people is better than a Overcrowdet 1 x 40 server"
