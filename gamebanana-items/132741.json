Instead I've added some map specific player skins, which is nevertheless a first for CSS!\r\n\r\nI'm currently planning on creating a ZE version of this map - if anyone can provide an Atix style helicopter prefab, this will be done!\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nMap, sound effects, model rigging by Alex Voysey\r\nMany thanks to ROY[NL] for making the elevator prefab!\r\n\r\nModels by Valve, edited by Alex Voysey.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract the BSP file to your cstrike/maps folder.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n===================================================\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\r\nBe sure that your server runs with SV_CONSISTENCY 0\r\nWithout this the map will not load!"
