The map will also no longer be called gmancity, now renamed to GGcity. The map has also received a gamemode update, it's now a proper hostage map. Enjoy :)<br><br>STORY:<br><span class=\"SelectedElement\">&nbsp;Terrorists have made themselves known in the streets &amp; alleyways of GGcity, causing chaos left and right, ultimately making the place deserted, with a few kidnapped hostages. The only people that remain are the terrorists &amp; a bunch of CT's ready to stop them. Will they survive?&nbsp;</span><br>"
