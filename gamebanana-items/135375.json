	"_sText": "My second map. This level has a pretty cool design. There's a large inverted pyramid for the ground with a bridge, buildings, pillars and boxes all in the middle. It's balanced for fair play and I tried to make it fun for all gun types. I payed a lot more attention to detail on this map; things like lighting, decals and glass. I think it will work well for gun game, so please try 'er out and tell me what you think.\r\n*buyzones included for use without gg\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** I fixed the spawn issue so there should be no more spawn kills :)"
