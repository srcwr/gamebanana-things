	"_sText": "My third map. This is no more than a pure fun map. It contains two very high buildings, some buy zones, many butttons and triggers and funny triggered events.\r\nSo Terrorists start on top of one building and counter-terrorists on the other one. Everyone has to jump. During your fall there are some obstacles. You can also try killing others while in the air. To avoid dying from your fall you'll need to aim one of the several pools. Than the fight can start.\r\nAlso try the buttons to trigger explosions or things, the elevators to go up, and the most funny, the Wheel of Misfortune : it's a rotating brush with many buttons on it. If you choose the good one, you can trigger esxplosion to kill campers for examples, but if you choose the bad one...you' can kill yourself.\r\n\r\nHave fun :D"
