	"_sText": "\r\nBreakceiling is a little homage to Tstar and his map Breakfloor. I hope you enjoy it as much as you would breakfloor. This is also dedicated to the Wildfire Clan and their love for break maps. To go to our site, go to www.wildfireclan.co.uk. Don't forget to leave us your comments in the forums!\r\n\r\nThe Teleport opens after 40 seconds into the round to stop people fom rushing the top. The teleport and the water are to prevent Team Killing, which is a major problem in Breakfloor.\r\n\r\nComments, suggestions or ideas?
