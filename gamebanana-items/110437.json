It has loads of ammo, so grab it if you can and dont try to lock yourself in corner or such!\r\n-Platforms break when you jump _off_ them.\r\n-Every platform breaks after 2 minutes from round start.\r\n-You regenerate health with the time.\r\n\r\nHave fun! :D\r\n Other notes: \r\nmap is designed for small servers. I can extend it up to 64 ppl if you want(write feedback) but i'm not not sure...\r\nNo HDR.\r\nNo easter eggs this time! :S\r\nMap is still wip!"
