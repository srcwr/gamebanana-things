Three ways around the wall, the west side hall, east side hall, or the space in the middle of the wall. \r\n     \r\n     Up the stairs is a nice area for snipers and campers alike to kill any enemies that did think it safe to leave the court yard(unless of course they are waiting for someone to go there, then its quite an easy shot)\r\n\r\n     The overall map was designed to be a fast sorta rushing map such as many fy maps, but with a added bit of strategy."
