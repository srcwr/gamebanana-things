	"_sText": "After playing the original Unity map (made by bclose) many many times, I decided it had too much detail and was too big. I removed all of the round edges, and decreased the size of the map. I then remodeled the entire map, and this is what I ended up with. On the original Unity map by bclose, I get sub 20fps. On this version (my version) of Unity, I get 45-50fps.\r\n\r\nBclose, if it wasn't for you, this would have never existed, so thank you. Your map is beautiful, but I lag whenever I play on it :/\r\n\r\n--\r\nTactical Zebra\r\n\r\nNOTE: To add this map to your game directory, simply download to your desktop, then unzip to your cstrike folder. Merge the folders, and then you are ready to play it!"
