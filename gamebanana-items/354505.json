	"_sText": "Welcome to surf_fantasy, the winner of the KSF Mapping Contest | Winter 2021 and my seventh skill surf map. The theme of the map is that of a fantasy land, loosely inspired by imagery and architecture found in LOTR, as well as Art Nouveau and other general fantasy themes and concepts. The map is of a casual difficulty level with a surf style that can be enjoyed by a range of surfers. I hope you have fun on the map!<br><br>Tier 3<br>4 Stages&nbsp;<br>3500 maxvelocity<br><br>Special thanks to KSF and the judges for hosting and running the event, as well as everyone who contributed to the prize pool and the mappers for making this contest the best one yet!<br>"
