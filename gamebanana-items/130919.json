	"_sText": "Finally my newest map &#8222;ZE_PHANTASY_ESCAPE&#8220;  has reached the Beta-Stadium.\r\nThis is the first public release but the map should work fine.\r\n\r\nIt&#8217;s dessigned for max. 64 Players!\r\nBoth teams start in a cave where they have 3 Options to go.\r\n1 &#8211; take the green path to a labyrinth\r\n2 &#8211; take the blue path to some dark rooms and flying bathtubs\r\n3- take the red path to a gondola \r\nAll these paths come together before a big river with a (very cute) dragon in it.\r\nHere they need to defend the river for 30 seconds &#8211; \r\nThen the dragon starts moving to the other side. \r\nThe humans now have to walk down a long tunnle.\r\nAt the end, there&#8217;s a nice little river &#8211; the boat should be the fastest way to cross it.\r\nWhen the river is crossed, a teleporter brings the player to a huge lake with the holy pyramide in it&#8217;s middle &#8211; when the pyramide is defended for one minute a teleprt brings those who&#8217;re on top of it to a safe place and kills all the others (hopefully zombies)\r\nTHIS IS A VERY EARLY RELEASE! If you test it anyways please give me a quick feedback &#8211; I&#8217;d really be happy `bout that!\r\nthanks and have fun\r\nBRATMAXE\r\n\r\nUPDATE** 8.11.09\r\n\r\n- Lightbridge added so humans can cross the lake after the dragon left\r\n- added some details in pyramid area\r\n- built cubemaps\r\n- fixed some leaks near the little river\r\n- added 2 missing textures\r\n- some additional messages on spawn\r\n"
