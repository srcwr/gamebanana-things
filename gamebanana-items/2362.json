It can be used for a spawn area, or on the battlegrounds of your next map. It will have working doors and buttons, ladders, and simple combine windows. I have chosen not to add any lighting to this prefab seeing as how I would like it to be used for dark maps, light maps, all kind of maps, and I'd like it for the user to have the control over this bunkers, its a simply body. It will be fully textured, and a will release a prefab of it fully in 'nodraw' so the user can texture it to his liking as well.</fieldset>"
