Each stage you will get a different monster which has a different ability.\n\nStage 1 - Antlion, gets a charge ability.\n\nStage 2 - Cyclope, gets a stomp ability.\n\nStage 3 - Pedobear, once near a enemy grips onto them and kills them.\n\nCT - You start with a m4a1 and a deagle, if you run out of ammo check the stock infront of your spawn. \n\nTatics - \n\nAntlion - Keep away from his front as you will take damage best to take him fron behind. ( Sounds Very Wrong )\n\nCyclope - Keep a fair distance away from his feet apart from that you can pretty much stand anywhere.\n\nPedobear - Spread out keep away from each other. Keep as far away from him as you can.\n\nThank you to WarmCup Mini-Games Community for testing all 10 betas.\n\nBest to play map with around 30 Players\n\nT Cannot pick up the weapons.\n\nYou can see this map played on 91.216.197.4:27044. \n\nwww.WarmCup.co.uk"
