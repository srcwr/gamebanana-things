Work started 14:47 on Friday and finally ended 00:07 the following day :P. Obviously not solid work, but it was pretty taxing to say the least. The next few days, I set about making tweaks testing and such so actually the total time spent on this is somewhere around the 10 - 20 hour mark.\r\n\r\nIf you do spot any bugs or have any suggestions to make, don't hesitate to leave a comment and I'll get onto fixing it as soon as I can :)\r\n___________________________________\r\n<h2>A few Features of this map:</h2>+Constant, high FPS<br>\r\n+HDR<br>\r\n+56 Spawns<br>\r\n+Waterfall :D<br>\r\n+Isometric layout.<br>\r\n+Large open design with multiple routes to each spawn, ideal for large amounts of players :).<br>\r\n___________________________________<br><h1>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.game-monitor.com/search.php?search=gg_timber_bridge&type=map\">Servers which might be running this map</a></strong></center>"
