Installation instructions - extract the fy_oasis_css.bsp file to maps in your cstrike folder \r\n(i.e. C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\<username>\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. File info - Tehbanned is proud to announce that we have our very own mappers here in house!!  \r\n[STFU]Beyotch and [STFU]Dammit (aka Bookem’ Dano) have put their heads together \r\n(among other things…eww) to port an arena map that we all know and love from CZ.  \r\nFy_oasis_css is a simple run and gun map that is fast paced and not for the weak of heart.  \r\nThis being the pair’s first attempt at porting, it is truly amazing that they put it together \r\non a Saturday afternoon, and released our first Beta test that night.  The couple’s \r\n(yes folks, it’s a husband and wife team) next attempt at bringing us an old favorite will be \r\nde_scud, a favorite among old school cs’ers.  Wish them luck and come by the server to give their \r\nartwork a look-see!!  Some pics of Oasis below, you can download this map and many more in our \r\ndownloads section, if you like what you see make sure you give them a shout out in our forums!!  \r\n\r\n"
