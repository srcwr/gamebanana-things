The style was based on a previous map I'd made, gg_vast, in the same manner of layout, texuring, and theory.\r\n\r\nPerfect for short range weapons, long range weapons, knifing and hegrenades.\r\n\r\nThis map also has buy-zones for anyone who wishes to have this on any non-gungame server.\r\n\r\nAll textures created by myself.\r\nSkybox texture created by Karatekaefer. Am I mooching from him or putting his excellent work to use? :P\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play this map on our gg server, please join us at:\r\n\r\n208.146.44.32:27015\r\n\r\nor visit us on the fourms:\r\n\r\nhttp://seattle-ducksoup.com/index.php\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n--Manqueef/Emeriastone & RadLionheart"
