	"_sText": "Whilst playing on a bhop server, someone suggested to me the idea of recreating bhop_jurfs_final. Since I was very bored during this time, I decided to take the offer. 7 Hours of work later, this is the result. I do not take credit for the original map design, the praise for that goes to ruBii. However, the Bonus & Extra 2 levels were added by me, they are just to lengthen the map and make speedrunning have more variety.\r\n\r\nDifficulty: Easy\t\r\nLength: Very Short\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!"
