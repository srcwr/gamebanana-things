If you know how to make secret doors (looks like wall, but can go through it), please PM me. :-D\r\n\r\nPlease write constructive critism, as I'm still in the newbie stage of map making. I may soon start working on a surf map.\r\n\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this map, just give me credits.\r\n\r\n##############INSTALLATION##################\r\n\r\nCopy the BSP file called \"fy_chralle\" to:\r\nC:/Programs/Steam/SteamApps/your_name/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps\r\n\r\n############################################\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems, let me know."
