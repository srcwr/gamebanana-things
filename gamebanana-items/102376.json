	"_sText": "Hello, this is my map that I made for the clan I am apart of. It is rather small, and from what I think now, shouldn't be a DE map. Personally, I think AIM would suit it better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I first started by making it a Dev textured map at the start, but many people told me it made the mapper look lazy, so I did a quick texture job. It isn't amazing, but It made the map look much better (from what my testers say). I think it looks much like a paintball arena.\r\n\r\nBomb zone B is furthest to the southeast corner, and opposite for A.\r\n\r\nThe map was intended for around 6v6.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, ask. If you have any critique, please state it. I realize that there are very minor mistakes in the geometry and texture, but its nothing that will disrupt game play or distract players.\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to drop by me and my friends clan server, the IP is 69.12.100.136:27015.\r\n\r\nYou can decompile my map if you wish but please ask for my permission first and make sure to just throw my name in the credits."
