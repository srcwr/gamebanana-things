I was finally able to generate a nav file an the map overall runs alot better then about 6 months ago.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the map is as optimized as I could get it, its pretty hard with a map this size, but I didn't get below 100fps in any area, however older computers will probably not be able to run this.\r\n\r\nThere are two bombsites, one in the factory near the middle of the map, and one in the main floor of the observatory (the room with the tesla things in it).\r\n\r\nAgain, the map does include a nav file to play around with bots, and a custom radar image to help you find where you are going.\r\n\r\nI was going to add more screens, but they were too big to upload at the best quality, so you can see more screens from older stages to get more of an idea of the map.\r\n[WiP1](http://www.gamebanana.com/wips/37336 \"WiP 1\")\r\n[WiP2](http://www.gamebanana.com/wips/36962 \"WiP 2\")\r\n\r\nHere is a video courtesy of jorre22225 (aka [JorisCeoen](http://www.youtube.com/user/JorisCeoen \"JorisCeoen\"))\r\n\r\n(Click the video to view be able to view in full HD!)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FGY9OmtNNuA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
