	"_sText": "I made this map, it's not a part of the origonal deagle_x9 series, but it's the 5th map in the series that was origonally suppose to be only 4 maps. But I was trying to think of more ideas for the series to expand it so it'll have more than just 4 maps in the series and I thought of having 4 Giant boxes. The \"H\" in the x9h part stands for Huge to resemble the size of the main 4 boxes. But unlike the first 4, I made this one all on my own. The others I worked on as a project with Glitch (aka Tr33t) and submitted them together with him. \r\n\r\nThe map itself holds more players than I planned on putting in, but I could fit more, so I did. It holds upto 42, although I would highly recommend not playing with that many people on a small map like this. \r\n\r\nThe lighting turned out very nice, the map looks very dark because of the textures I used, but the lighting makes it look like a bright dark color, so it's like you're playing in a dark map but you can see just fine where you're going. \r\n\r\n"
