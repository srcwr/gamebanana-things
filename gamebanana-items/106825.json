When youre done please rate it and maybe leave a feedback or an small comment. </font>\r\n \r\n<font size=2\"><b>Some main features</b></font>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>3D skybox</b></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Soundscapes</b></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>patched inferno brush models.</b> <b>(thansk natalya)</b></li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Custom meshes</li>\r\n\r\n<li><b> nav.file (included in the rar.file)</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Grönis and Dirtyboy for helping me with some small beta testing\r\nAnd special thanks to Shadow108 who came up whith the map name.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and downloading this map.\r\n\r\nHave fun! / Alex\r\n\r\n<font size\"2\" color=\"green\">Don´t forget to rate and comment.
