	"_sText": "This is my first map, and it is a combo of fy (since its not too big) and de (since it has a bomb-place in the middle).\r\n\r\nSome walls have gray arrows, which indicates a hidden door in the wall, and on 2 places (to the left when u spawn) there is a invisible ladder marked with a red arrow pointing upwards. It leads to a AWP (Look at screenshot E).\r\nSome walls have a square hole in them, where u can only see the top of the players heads, BUT if you jump straight up u can see a bit more.\r\n\r\nThanks to Silent Assassin for support with Pakrat and advice :D"
