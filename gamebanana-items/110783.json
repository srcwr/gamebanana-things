I realize the lighting isn't perfect, it doesn't affect your game play any so I'm not too worried about it.\r\n\r\nYou can boost over the center wall which was my intention.\r\n\r\nThere is an awp on the roof of both buildings. You can not triple stack to get on the roof, however you can throw a grenade up there to get it down."
