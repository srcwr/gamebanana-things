In case the screenshots weren't very clear (It's a bitch to show what I want to with screenshots), this is a stylized map set in 'Cyberspace.'\r\n\r\nEvery texture in this map is custom, though there are only seven, total. Very quick download, gauranteed, this map is less than 1 mb in filesize! It's completely optimized, and ready for deathmatch or just regular round-based killing. There are no hostages or bomb-zones, though.\r\n\r\nI plan on making several more Digitopia maps, but this is the first one.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are 42 player spawns, but the map was designed for comfortable gameplay between two 6-10 player teams."
