	"_sText": "Author: Titan1x77\r\n\r\nName: gg_weir\r\n\r\nRelease notes: This version is a stripped down version of de_weir, removed decorations, and spread spawns out, changed to a later time of day too, sun is setting. Makes for a great Gungame or Deathmatch map.\r\n\r\nType: GG or DM 50 spawns\r\nDescription: Small intense map. Access to high vantage points everywhere and a few small areas with vent access too! \r\n\r\nBuild notes: 2 weeks, first time using Hammer (so it's my first map), learned a lot while making this level, and enjoyed doing so. Concentrated on gameplay/balance more then looks, wanted to keep framerate as high as possible for an large outdoor area map.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n**NOTE**\r\nScreenshots are from the DE version, only removed decoration props and changed lighting, also removed radar images to keep file size down for DM or GG.\r\n\r\nNAV file is packed in BSP."
