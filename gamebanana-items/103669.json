There are two bio-hazardous tank sites, the terrorist's job is to destroy these.\r\n\r\nMy plan with this map is to not stop prematurely. I want this map to go all the way to professional status, radar, sprites, area portals, the works. So by releasing this, I just want to know feedback; ie. opinions of aesthetics, gameplay feedback, stuff along those lines.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nfishy (bmx3r1011)\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.intoxgaming.com"
