	"_sText": "I have tried for soooo long to make the glass bullet proof, i don't think it can be done with the glass panels being so thin, however bullet damage is greatly reduced.  I don't know why the engine did this but i noticed that the damage is allot less.\r\n\r\nin the middle of each side of the map there is a button(2 buttons total).  When pressed an alarm will sound, nerve gas comes from the ground and after 30 second will start to damage players, all players on the ground must go to the stairs and onto the catwalks in order to survive and continue fighting.\r\n\r\nAlso, i was not able to test this map fully on a \"mass player\" scale, only about 15 people were in the beta server, which no longer is active :(  PLZ PLZ PLZ PM me if there are spawn point problems, i do no think there will be but like i said i was unable to test this map with full 48 players..."
