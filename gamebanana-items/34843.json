Some broken-off important pathways were restored (in particular - a way from a porch over boxes to a cellar, exits through window apertures, etc.).\r\n\r\nWell... bots have opportunity to use all walkable ways now. Be sure, that they will serve you in compliance with all rules of hospitality! :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original .nav-file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/179851).\r\n\r\nFight and Fun! Your remarks and feedbacks are always welcomed :-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Dinus Saurus (for high detailed and very realistic urban-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nRoom reservation is temporarily cancelled: SWAT are working!\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 11.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Added Place Names;\r\n- Some other minor changes.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
