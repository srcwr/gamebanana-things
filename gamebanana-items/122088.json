	"_sText": "<b>surf_frost</b> is a Tier 1 Linear map with 8 Bonuses.<br><br>The intention of this map was to create a very old-style feel for a surf map. This was done with easy yet fast obstacles and turns, with relatively small ramps of varying sizes.<br><br>In the hub you can find the 8 bonuses. Bonuses 1-6 are labeled at their respective doors, bonus 7 is labeled as \"1.6\" at its door, and bonus 8 is an unlabeled door on the outside of the hub and can be seen from spawn.<br><br>Bonus 1 is made by pretzL and bonus 2 is made by Ret_rded aka Sam.<br><br>The bonuses are meant to be a wide mix of styles such as fast strafing bonuses, tougher unit-check bonuses, and smooth maxvel bonuses.<br><br>Bonus 7 is known as the \"1.6 bonus\" as it was intended to replicate the old style of cs 1.6 surf / kz. With that being said, it is also meant to be played with autohop and essentially every skip you can find is allowed.<br><br>Thanks to everyone who tested and special thanks to Sam for helping me not mess up all the filters in my map.<br><br>Huge thanks to EarthwormEd for the showcase video:<br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUCBmeHMW5k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br><br>Thanks to everyone who plays this map.. Enjoy!<br>"
