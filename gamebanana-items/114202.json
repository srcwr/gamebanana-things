My 25th map! I'm now at the 1/4th mark for 100 maps.\r\nHeh, I hardly doubt I'd get there. :)\r\nAnyway, I didn't think I'd end up releasing this one. \r\nIt would've been better looking with custom textures and props to make it feel more like a real mall rather then just boarded up doors but I like to do what I can with what I'm given. \r\n\r\nI plan on using custom textures someday though so cheers to that. \r\nAnyway, enjoy this map fellas<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2b8ENc_Ak\">!</a>"
