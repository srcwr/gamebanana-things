Comments? \r\n\r\nEmail me at daninator007@gmail.com or add me to steam daninator007\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nThis map was originally in Call of Duty and i asked my friend xeno \r\n(hence the name gg_xeno) if i could transfer his map into css. He said\r\nyes and i made it for css. What i didn't do was post it and the original \r\nversion was deleted once i got a new computer. So here is a remake of the \r\noriginal map but better. The basic layout is the same.\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nInstallation: Put into your cstrike/maps folder.\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n"
