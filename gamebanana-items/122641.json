	"_sText": "Surf_ny_advance\r\nby FAJ\r\n--------------------------------\r\nSkill surf map with 4 phases. The first 3 phases stress a particular skill, with 3 stages. The first stage introduces the skill. the second stage complicates it and the thrid stage adds a gimmick or a more difficult section. The fourth phase test all 3 skills. I would have had more stages, but I ran out of faces/brushes to do it in.\r\n--------------------------------\r\nTimer is 100 seconds, it reverts back to zero everytime a stage is beaten for the first time. Minimum complete time is ~3 minutes.\r\n--------------------------------\r\nThis map is designed for 66 tick. It will work on a higher tick, but the moving parts wont move properly and the levels won't be calibrated the same.\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nAuthor's note: The map is probably too difficult for practical multiplayer/pub situations. It is not meant to be for everyone, although I have heard from many surfers that it is not as hard as it looks. I would prefer not to get comments about it being too hard or too easy, as objective difficulty plagues any skill map anyways."
