Well its a map which is similar (in layout) to mariokart.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I made this map was I was fed up with different awp_lego maps that were too small and therefore not much fun >.<\r\n\r\nBasically, this is just a map which has lighting, a few ramps at differnt heights.\r\nYou cant get spawn killed (unless you run into the gap in the middle :P)\r\n\r\n84 players in total can play on this map (42 per team) and every player begins with:\r\n\r\n- awp\r\n- deagle\r\n- knife\r\n- grenade\r\n\r\nConsidering this is NOT my first map, I would appreciate feedback and be harsh with me ... its the only way that I will improve!\r\n\r\nThe download should contain the BSP and the correct map textures (would use pacrat or something else) however, my computer loves to reject it which is pretty annoying :(\r\n\r\nIf for some strange reason, the textures arent included, here is the link:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/1348\r\n\r\nThis map was made within a few minutes as it wasnt very difficult to construct.\r\n* Please do not upload elsewhere and do not edit the map *\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy :D\r\n\r\nCookieHorde\r\n\r\nP.S As mentioned, credits to the people that made the lego textures."
