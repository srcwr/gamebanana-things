	"_sText": "This is my first map uploaded to FPSB...\r\n\r\nThis map is a maze-like tunnel underneath a flat surface. There are 4 points which lead up to the surface, these points are where teams will spawn, so the team has a choice of going up to the surface to fight or staying underneath in the darkness to prey on their victims. I would reccommend using a flshlight... There is also a small pool of water in the middle of the map so listen out for sloshing footsteps in water...\r\n\r\nSince this is not the final release, I would like to ask you a couple of Questions...\r\n-Should the tunnels be light or dark?\r\n-What sort of props/obstacles should I add to the surface?\r\n\r\nPlease be nice when giving feedback since this is the first map I have uploaded, and is DEFINITELY not the final version-the reason I uploaded was mostly to get feedback."
