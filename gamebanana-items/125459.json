I managed to get that down to about 24 MB.  \r\n\r\nThis is pretty much a random b-hop map I made when I was bored.\r\nThere is about 7 secrets in this map, try to find them all. ;)\r\nI've learned many things by making this map that I can use in future ideas.\r\nI didn't run VIS because it would take about 2 days to compile. (I'm a noob mapper.)\r\nThis is pretty much my first serious map.\r\nAll the people who helped with this map are at the end of the map written on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
