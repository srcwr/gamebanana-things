	"_sText": "A map I wasn't going to finish but decided to because I got bored, around a minute in length and pretty varied in terms of gameplay. No checkpoints because its not hard anyway. I think it's a pretty neat/different style map overall. Also has a short bonus that was made by ArcticPanda.<br><br>This was just a map I made for fun, I know the gameplay is very different from typical maps but I thought it was fun so I wanted to expand on it. Hopefully others will enjoy running it too.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADvXt4QJD4Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
