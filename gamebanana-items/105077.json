	"_sText": "A defuse map with a twist. The T's start in the bombsite, a warehouse with secret intel. Their plan is to blow it up to prevent the CT's gathering their special intel. While the T's are planting the bomb the CT's have to get their in time, equipped with a defuser already. There are many places to enter the warehouse. Some include the front and side door. A climbing place. A tree house connection. Make a tactic with your team and stop the T's from blowing up the intel. Recommended to play with a longer bomb. (Preferably around 40 seconds - 90 seconds) Still in beta. Tell me what should I improve on."
