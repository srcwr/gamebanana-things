HE grenades are also available. The roofs are assessible by the exposed pipes on the walls which can be climbed.\r\n\r\nIt offers a very unique and non conventional gameplay. Players must know and be always aware of the ennemies sniper spots.\r\n\r\nA nav file included in bsp. Playing with bots is also quite fun in this map.\r\n\r\nHave fun, and give me your feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is a video on the defuse version of this map:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bl53hkx2GPM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nHastal @ Vista"
