I did not plan on updating it, But then the guys at the Gamers Syndicate or [G`Syn] said they would put it on their server.  \r\n\r\nI refuesed to let them put that one on.  So i made a new version.  \r\n\r\nand here it is!\r\n\r\nfixes\r\n\r\n1.) textures... so many texture fixes\r\n2.) new ending\r\n3.) more button delay (1.25 to 2)\r\n4.) fixed the fire pit\r\n\r\nProbably more that i am missing... But anyway.  This version is alot better, and i hope you all enjoy it!"
