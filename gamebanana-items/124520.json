	"_sText": "Okay i made a remake of this bhop map, cuz the gameplay of the map is pretty (i think) and i just did so many mistakes the first time that i made it, cuz it was my first map in 6 years or so... So now i made a remake.\r\n\r\nThe fixes/changes/improvement:\r\n\r\n- changed the speed and delay of every block.\r\n- changed the textures to some better looking ones.\r\n- changed the hight of the walls, cuz the old ones looked stupid.\r\n- added some details to the walls, when entering a new lvl.\r\n- fixed the bug on the lvl with the fire, it now NOT possible to complete that lvl by jumping on the fire things.\r\n- added alot of brushes to func_detail\r\n- added nodraw to the water (dont know if it help anything ^^)\r\n- added 4 more player spawn (max players is now 20)\r\n- \"removed\" the nasty GILF picture in the darkroom.\r\n- added elites to the end \r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis remake will definitely be more playable than the last one... Enjoy guys !"
