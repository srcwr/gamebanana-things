	"_sText": "Hi... This is my first publicly released map.  I made it for our clan's French public server. \r\nIt's a night customisation of the original de_dust2 by David Johnston.\r\n\r\nThe first challenge was to make the enemy visible during the action... I had to find a good palette of colours for the lighting, fog and the skybox 3D too :)\r\n \r\n\r\n... All the well-loved various action zones are bright enough so you can easily recognize the enemy. But you know ... night is night, right.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW STUFF:\r\n---------\r\n---> Site A: a ct vehicle and a little shelter. \r\n---> Site B: 2 trucks and another shelter, with some computers and nuclear stuff inside. \r\n---> T Spawn: A nice Helicopter.\r\n---> MIDDLE: A tower which can be demolished with high explosives. The tower was already there in the original de_dust2, but I have made it climbable! \r\nBut it's dangerous to camp inside the tower because of the detonator placed on \"short A\" ct path. You'll may like the view, however :) ...Its a good place to have a romance with a css-girl ! (lol..lol...) \r\n\r\n\r\nFOR FPS BANANA USERS:\r\n--------------------\r\nI saw a \"de_dust2_night\" which is a nice map by 7th Graal on this site.... HONESTLY when this map appeard on the site I was already working on de_dust2_bynight_v1 :(\r\nI was a little disappointed :) ... but nevermind. I hope you'll like my map too.\r\n\r\nThe fog in the map is a dreamy blue colour. Hope you'll enjoy the colour style of the overview ... which is also an original one!\r\n\r\nTHANKS: to Predulus / S.E.A.L. for his knowledge and his good advice - he helped me a lot ... this man made <a href=\"http://fpsbanana.com/maps/23339\">de_paris</a> and <a href=\"http://fpsbanana.com/maps/27138\">de_dustanesi</a>! Very good maps that you can find on fps banana :) ... THX man ! You are my own personal Yoda :!\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, sorry for my English - I'm French :D ..."
