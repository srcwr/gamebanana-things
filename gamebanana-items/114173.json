Be aware that the main ceiling\r\nis to low to jump from ceiling to ceiling.  This is no mistake but done in an effort to shorten\r\nround times be avoiding a standoff where players can't find each other.\r\n\r\nThis is my first map that I am posting for download on the net.  If you got suggestions or Ideas for\r\nnew maps, please email me at Spartacus415@optonline.net\r\nYou will be given credit for advice and ideas.
