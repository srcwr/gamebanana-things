	"_sText": "surf_premium, sponsored by Zero Tolerance Servers is my fourth project for the skill surf community. This map took roughly two months to make and I am glad to finally release it :)Â <br><br>The number of ramps used in each stage corresponds with the stage number, ie. stage 1 uses one ramp, stage 2 uses two ramps, and so on, with the final stage using one ramp from each of the previous stage. The map is tier 2 and should allow surfers of all skill levels to enjoy the map.<br><br>Again, a big shoutout to Samatazz and Mitchthebtch of Zero Tolerance Servers for sponsoring this map and making it all possible. GLHF<br><br>Tier 2, 8 Stages, 2 bonuses<br><br>3500 maxvel<br>"
