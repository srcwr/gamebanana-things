	"_sText": "Gungame map, with buyzone included.\r\n\r\nThis map is the longer version of gg\\_towerbit\\_v4. In the spawn zone we can still snipe to the enemy spawn zone and tower. Then, we have three towers, one to each team and a smaller one, with thin walls (so, easly pierceable). This center tower has a huge advantage, it gives you health at the center of it! But, you must be careful, as the walls on the outside are transparent, so you can't see them, but they can see you... :P\r\nThen, we have the side paths, mazed enough to allow players to humiliate others. There are plenty of other sniping spots and hides all over this side paths.\r\nThen, we can get up on the walls that delimit the tower's base space, those walls have thin cover walls for you to crouch, aim and shoot some players for a while.\r\nThe map is very balanced and it's very fun to play on it, as if you play in a server with more than 14 players, you will always feel unsafe with the chance of someone humiliate you ;)"
