Remember, however many you have is the max amount of people that can race at one time. The mod offsets the angle of the info targets oddly, so I included an arrow that is pointing in the direction the cars will be pointing when they spawn. *</li>\r\n<li>Trigger check points. There are 3 here, to make more just copy/paste and then increment the number after the # by one. ex. checkpoint_#4, checkpoint_#5, etc...**</li>\r\n<li>Spectator Zone with Cycler***</li></ul>\r\n<fieldset>\r\n* - If you change the angle of the info target with in the entity, the arrow will no longer be accurate.\r\n** - Do not have duplicate checkpoints in the map, the mod can not compensate for them. ex. dont not have two checkpoint_#1s in the map.\r\n*** - For this, I have the garys mod model selected, you may or may not have that model by defualt.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend> <b class=red> More info!</b></legend>\r\nHere is the original explanation of the mod entities by the mod creator:\r\n\r\n<b>Race map:</b>\r\nrace_derby_v1.zip is a map file\r\nanother 2 map files, http://www.sendspace.com/file/er7v8f\r\nYou can create race map for this plugin\r\nThere are 4 types special entity for this plugin, all are defined in rallyrace.sp:\r\n\r\n<b>Check Point:</b> car check points\r\nClassname: \"trigger_multiple\"\r\nTargetname: \"checkpoint_#\"+(1..)\r\nWait (Delay before reset): 0.1 (best value is 0.1, don't set 0)\r\nfor the first checkpoint, targetname must be \"checkpoint_#1\", second checkpoint, \"checkpoint_#2\". (up to checkpoint_#x , where x is the largest integer number in sourcemod, and don't make stupid things, like checkpoint_#-1, checkpoint_#a, checkpoint_## and so on, if server crash don't ask me)\r\n\r\n<b>Ready Zone:</b> when player inside the zone, mean player can play on next race round\r\nClassname: \"trigger_multiple\"\r\nTargetname: \"ready_zone\"\r\nWait: 0.1 or default\r\nCreate a \"env_sprite\", use model \"zx2_car/go.vmt\", put it into the \"ready_zone\" center, it will show a \"GO!\" picture\r\n\r\n<b>Spectate Zone:</b> when player inside the zone, switch player to spectate team directly\r\nClassname: \"trigger_multiple\"\r\nTargetname: \"spectate_zone\"\r\nWait: 0.1 or default\r\nCreate a \"cycler\", use model \"models/gman.mdl\", let player know there is a spectate zone (or some sexy model)\r\n\r\n<b>Car Spawn Point:</b> car spawn points\r\nClassname: \"info_target\"\r\nTargetname: \"car_spawn\"\r\nAngle: you must set the correct angle \r\n\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset> <legend> <b class=orange>Tutorial!</b> </legend>\r\nBe sure to check out <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/tuts/9397\">UNREAL's Tutorial</a> on how to make your own rally race map!\r\n\r\n</fieldset>"
