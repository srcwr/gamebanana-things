	"_sText": "This is the updated version of breakfloor_falls.\r\n---\r\nAdded more lighting\r\nStronger blocks\r\nAll players face the other teams spawn\r\nPit is not as long\r\n---\r\nThis is based on Tstar's Breakfloor. Idea goes to Tstar.\r\n\r\nThis is like breakfloor except theres a pit so you don't die. When your in the pit you can shoot the blocks and make the opposing team fall. Watch out as other people will fall and kill you.\r\n\r\nThe Maximum players is 44. That means there are 22 spawn points in each spawn. I recommend 24 players in all so the blocks aren't gone so fast.\r\n\r\nScreen shot A those are the 2 spawns. The map is A LOT brighter than that.\r\n\r\nScreen shot B is the pit.\r\n\r\n- Conch"
