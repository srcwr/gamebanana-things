It is somewhat of a fightyard layout but it does have a tunnel system that circles around the entire lower portion of the map.  \r\n\r\nThere are three different levels.  You can excess the top of the buildings via ladders and each building has its own tunnel entrance with four other tunnel <i>exits/entrances</i> from the center yard area. \r\n\r\n<b class=\"orange\">Added features below</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>36 spawnpoints</li>\r\n<li>Ambient Sounds</li>\r\n<li>3D skybox</li>\r\n<li>Displacements</li>\r\n<li>Buyzones</li>\r\n<li>Custom texturs</li>\r\n<li>Cables/wires</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<font size=\"3\"><b class=\"orange\">Note:</b></font><br>\r\nIf you want to do an assessment, I know that \"Internet Explorer\" works.  I'm not sure Firefox will work.\r\nAlso I am aware of some of the textures not quite lining up in the tunnel area, but once the brushes have been stretched and skewed its seems impossible to get the textures to line up properly. So if anyone has any information on how to fix this please feel free to send that info my way.  I'm open to all constructive criticism. "
