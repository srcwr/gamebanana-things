	"_sText": "This map has many options on attacking the other side, it will not get boring! \r\n\r\n   (1) Ware House\r\n \r\nIn the Warehouse where you see all the boxes, in the middle there is a solid box and on both sides there is a breakable box, so this is not your typical attack as you can shoot the box and see the enemy coming or hide and do a close range fire fight.\r\n\r\n   (2) Street\r\n\r\nUsing smoke grenades and flash bang is a good way for a Terrorist to advance into the underpass and is a good middle point. If you run into the office or Ware House and notice no one is coming in that direction fall back and flank the CT's. I think it will be kind of tricky to snipe as a Terrorist because there are 3 areas people can come out of and the sniper can get flanked kinda easy if they are not paying attention around them.\r\n\r\n   (3) Office\r\n\r\nGood place for mid range snipe weapons smoke and flash bang will help a lot to advance to the break area to advance."
