	"_sText": "This is surf_sharks by Dan.  I made this map.  It is a small arena like map.\r\nYou hold down your jump button (preferably space bar) to skim across the water at high speeds and knife them to death.  There are 4 shotguns with unlimited ammo in the corners (only guns accurate while water scimming).  If you are afk you fall into the water after 20 seconds and drown.  After 2 minutes have passed, if you havent yet died you will get hurt with 2 damage every 1/2 second.  If lose speed just go on bottom to teleport back to your spawn.  Boosters on the sides.\r\n\r\nenjoy\r\n- Dan"
