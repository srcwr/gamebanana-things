YOU CAN DOMINATE ANY MAP!!!!\r\n\r\nEach player is spawned in a room with one enemy. Who ever survives the stand off has \r\n\r\nto face the other survivers in the hallway.\r\n\r\nAmmo is limited so use your bullets wisely, or atleast save enough to make it to the \r\n\r\ntop of the map where there are plenty of weapon pick-ups\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nThis is our first ever map, we only figured out how to use WWMT for 3DSMAX about 4 \r\n\r\nhours ago, and this is our first project to come out of it, so please let us know if \r\n\r\nthere is anything that we can improve on.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS:\r\n\r\nJust gotta quickly say thanks to \r\nSource for such an amazing engine.\r\nAutodesk for mind blowing 3d modelling software.\r\nWall Worm for making such an easy method of exporting maps straight from Max into \r\n\r\nSource games.\r\nGamebana for being so awesome.\r\nAnd you for your amazing mouse clicking skills that got you to this download :D"
