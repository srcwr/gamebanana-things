	"_sText": "This is the updated, and much improved, version of Rage. The updates include two important glitch fixes and a major face lift. Urban takes you out of the Dev arena of Rage, and places you in an urban training zone, with construction, trees and even bushes to hide in. The lighting is by far my best, and the textures give the map an all-around green look. One of the glitches fixed was the ability to jump off the rooftop bombsite, and navigate along the outer walls along the map. This was fixed with the addition of taller walls. Another glitch fixed, was the water planting site. I noticed it was way too hard for the bots to plant/defuse with the ability to plant in the water, so I removed that. Other than those details, Urban remains nearly the same as Rage in geography, with a whole new color scheme and lighting effect. "
