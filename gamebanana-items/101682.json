	"_sText": " De_CrookCounty is massive in size. The unzipped .bsp file is 80mb in size, while the map is over 4 city blocks in size. Terrorists start inside the jail cells of the police station and manage to escape, while the Counter-Terrorists start off approximately 3 blocks away from Crook County PD. There's quite a lot of routes both teams can take, but ultimately the main objective of both teams is to reach either Ammunition (Site A) or the 5 story tenement building (Site B). The Terrorists can plant the bomb on any floor of the gun shop, and floors 2-5 of the tenement building which causes frustration as the CT's search room-to-room and floor-to-floor for the hidden bomb.\r\n\r\nIts recommended that servers which run this map disable AWP's and Auto sniper rifles, as they tend to be cheap to those who tend to run down the street without thinking. Limiting the AWP to one or two people per team is a better idea, though. Just make sure to use some stealth by hiding in the shadows as it works wonders. "
