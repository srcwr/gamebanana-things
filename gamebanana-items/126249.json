I've had a lot of free time the past few days so decided I would just get it out of the way.&nbsp;<br><br>Although I was tempted to change the gameplay in some areas in the end I decided not to so it would still have that classic feel to it. Times on this and the original should be basically interchangeable.&nbsp;<br><br>I did make a little bonus just for the revamp though.<br><br>This will probably be my last bhop map for awhile"
