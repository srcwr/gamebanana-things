It is set within a small arena with objects placed tactically forcing you to use skill to eliminate your enemies. This is a texture map. It is a 2x2 checkerboard layout and works very well :)\r\nI made this map to my own design.\r\n\r\n<b>Objective:</b>\r\nUse the objects and environment to beat your enemies in gunfights. Pure skill will save you from getting that one headshot you didn't deserve...\r\n</center>"
