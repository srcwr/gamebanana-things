Only the awp just has 10 bullets, because I dont want people to camp with it ^^\r\n\r\nThere is no jail, because the map is so easy to surf so I think its not necessary. If you fall down the map just kills you ^^\r\n\r\nThis is my first map so please leave a comment and help me improve.\r\n\r\nFinal release : [Your text to link here...](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/161322 \"http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/161322\")"
