So as you can see, i did it. \r\n\r\nBlue side is the CT's,\r\nRed side is the T's. \r\n\r\nThe players try to make it to the top without getting killed by a boulder. If they do that, they get teleported to the top of the middle tower and push the magic button to kill the other team. Congrats, you win!\r\n\r\nThanks to flapjax for hosting the map during testing.\r\n\r\nENJOY!"
