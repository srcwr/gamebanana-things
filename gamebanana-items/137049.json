Medium sized.\r\n\r\nI've been sitting on this for several months, I had an idea in my head but the architecture did not translate into a good map. I could not get over it or figure out a solid compromise at the time and shelved it.\r\n\r\nI just came back to the map a week ago, developed an idea on the spot and ran with it, after some grueling time spent and some concessions I'm done tooling around with it.  \r\n\r\nThere are some \"brush\" misalignment but they are all func_details and unrelated to world geometry."
