I dont want people comparing it to maps like de_wanda etc. Its only for fun and training. Only provide feedback saying whats wrongand if you like it. I dont plan on editing the map for future releases though.\r\n\r\nNote: in screenshots the map looks dark - this is because it took the screenshots from outside the skybox. Its medium brightness in-game\r\n"
