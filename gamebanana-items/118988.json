Its a little on the big side, but as players spawn with deagles, nades and armour, it makes it a little more than your average awp map.\r\n\r\nI will be adapting this into a cs map before the new years, completed this in under 4 days too.  May update this sometime to include stuff I wanted to but ran out of time for, such as snow, HDR and radar."
