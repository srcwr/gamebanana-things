	"_sText": "This is my first map, and it was left cooking for some time. I've finally decided to release it after so many years. The project actually began on a 2004 computer, so it's been optimized for low end machines. I've upgraded 2 years ago, where I then decided to continue, and only until now I feel that it should see the light of day. \r\n\r\nI had a fun time recreating the level design, and it was an immense learning experience. There's so many things I want to try differently, or change, but it was a fine line between a realistic environment and a fun multiplayer map. The map extends further than any RPD map I've played, and to reach some of these places may require a secret or two ;)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, criticisms, or tweaks, fire away, but most of all I hope you enjoy! And feel free to use it for whatever (though, I'd love to play it with a bunch of peeps, so holler)."
