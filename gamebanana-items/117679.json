	"_sText": "This is a quick map I made because I thought it would be pretty cool.  Its nothing amazing but its really fun.  This was inspired by a paintball field and a report I had to read in English class.  The paper was about stoping gang violence so the guy suggested to make and arena and put the gangs into it and have them battle it out.  So i thought a paintball field would be perfect for it except the bunkers are made of metal.  So yeah, here it is, I hope you enjoy it!"
