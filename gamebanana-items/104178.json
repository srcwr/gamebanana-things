So there should'nt be major bugs.\r\nIt's a big smokey city themed map with L-Train and subway station.\r\nThere are 3 main routes to the bombsites.\r\n\r\nTerrorists must destroy the L-Train tracks or eliminate the Playground.\r\nCounter-terrorist have to defend the spots at all costs.\r\nDon't use snipers for more fun :D\r\n\r\n+ changelogs\r\n\r\nAdded bombsite B.\r\nAdded 32-32 spawns.\r\nAdded extra route to B.\r\nAdded covers on streets(boxes,wrecks)\r\nAdded HDR and soundscapes + volumetric fog.\r\nAdded a noobroom for cheaters :D or annoying players.\r\n\r\nCredits: \r\n\r\nThanks to Chizbone for making the advanced nav file.\r\nThanks to Nauz for the palm model.\r\nThanks to tazzz for helping with major bugs and fixing some errors.\r\n\r\nEnjoy (and don't forget to give me a hi5 :) )"
