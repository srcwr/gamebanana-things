Because people asked me to. A lot of people told me that they really like bhop\\_fury and are hungry for more like that.\r\n\r\nSo here it is. bhop\\_fury\\_2 uses the same design and same gameplay as bhop\\_fury.\r\n\r\nFeatures of the map:\r\n\r\n-  Longjump section (240-270 in 5 unit steps)\r\n\r\n- 22 bhop and 2 short xc levels\r\n\r\n- First level is skippable to be noobfriendly (costs more time then doing it)\r\n\r\n- 9 chilling songs (can be restarted at every level, and random music button for longjump section)\r\n\r\n- Optimized with nodraw, func\\_detail, areaportals and hint&skip\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you have fun with this map!\r\n\r\nIf you like my work, please subscribe.\r\n\r\nDotty\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of a broken entity and a not working telepoter, I decided to fix the map and change the file.\r\n\r\nPlease redownload the file! It is fixed now. \r\n\r\nSorry for that"
