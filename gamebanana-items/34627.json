Want to use all the weapons? The goal of this mod is to try to make all weapons worth their cost, and to bring all weapons closer to each other in performance so they would remain useful. The changes are also meant to improve tactical teamplay - meaning that in close range maps shotguns should be used, and in long range maps snipers should be used at long range, not at point blank range. Different weapon choises should be made based on map as for example AUG > M4 at long range, but < at close to medium range. Also some realism is added like more realistic pistol firing rates, movement speeds with weapons, and weapons of same caliber doing almost the same damage.\r\n\r\nSMGs and shotguns are almost as good as assault rifles at close range. If you get an assault rifle, you pretty much get it only to be able to fight longer ranged battles too. The sniper rifles' damage is reduced too so a better equipped team doesn't instantly win if they can afford them and the opposition can not. To make the sniper rifles still good at long range battles the accuracy of assault rifles has been reduced. All of this should lead to a more fair gameplay where your skill and the support of your team mates is more important than the weapon you have. The weapon changes should also reduce the defending team's (camping) advantage.\r\n\r\nPistols -> Pretty much remain the same, except the Desert Eagle which is brought more\r\nin line with the other pistols.\r\nSMGs-> More firepower, less movement speed. Mac10 and UMP45 are cost effective now.\r\nShotguns -> More firepower at close range, but less than before at long range.\r\nAssault Rifles -> Accuracy has been reduced. The effectiveness of longe range\r\nAK headshotting is reduced. AUG and SG552 should also be worth their cost now as\r\nthey're more accurate than the other assault rifles.\r\nSniper Rifles -> -Firepower. No more should every member in a team be equipped with them\r\nas now the weapons need more skill to be used effectively.\r\nMachinegun -> More firepower and controllability with the cost of movement speed.\r\nThe weapon can now be used as a fire support weapon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment the mod is just edited weapon script files that are put\r\nto the scripts directory of a Source Dedicated Server. The mod is probably\r\ngoing to be turned into a plugin or a mod that shows as a different game, but\r\nthat isn't going to happen until I find out how to do it. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning a server with the mod - Source Dedicated Server\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPut the weapon script files to your server's \"\\cstrike\\scripts\" directory and start your server. Every client joining the game without the script files now uses the new weapon values from the script files except few things that don't affect gameplay much:\r\n- Clients don't get the changed weapon muzzle flash sizes.\r\n- Clients don't get the changed weapon crosshair sizes.\r\n- Clients still see the AUG's ammo type as 7.62mm.\r\n- Clients don't see the right amount of bullets that the XM1014 shoots (9 in this mod - like the M3).\r\n- Clients can start to reload the AWM even though it has full ammo (5 in this mod), causing the reload animation to start and then instantly stop.\r\n(To get all the changes, you need to join the game with the exact same script files installed)\r\n\r\nIF YOU'RE RUNNING THE NON-STEAM (HLDS) VERSION OF SRCDS, THEN YOU NEED TO DELETE THE WEAPON .CTX FILES FROM THE SCRIPTS DIRECTORY THAT HAVE OTHERWISE THE SAME NAME AS THESE .TXT FILES BEFORE STARTING YOUR SERVER. IF YOU WANT TO RESTORE THE OLD WEAPONS, THEN JUST RUN THE HLDS UPDATE AGAIN, AND DELETE THESE .TXT FILES.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It's recommended to use the included pure_server_whitelist.txt file and install it to your server's cstrike directory, and then to use sv_pure 1. This ensures no one can join the game with different scripts files in scripts directory and cause sync errors for them. So players without any weapon scripts files can join, as well as the ones with the exact same script files as the server installed to their game directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to install the mod and testing it without Source Dedicated Server\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUnzip/Install all the weapon script files to \"steamapps\\(username)\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\scripts\". Run Counter-Strike: Source as normal. If you run a server without Source Dedicated Server, everyone else joining the game must have the exact same script files installed too or sync errors happen - You also need to delete or move the weapon script files when you want to play default CSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHostname\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIt's recommended to name your game so that all know that this mod is running and the version of it. For example \"AD Weapon Balance 1.28\".\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to uninstall or disable the mod\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDelete or move the weapon script files from the scripts directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional directory\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe Optional directory contains pure_server_whitelist.txt that you can use with your server. More info about the file in \"Running a server with the mod\" NOTE field.\r\n\r\nThe Optional directory also contains cstrike_english.txt that changes all weapon names to real ones, and fixes few things from the buy menus. The AWM magazine capacity is also changed to 5 like in this mod. Unzip the cstrike_english.txt to \"steamapps\\(username)\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\resource\" to use it. Your Counter-Strike: Source language must be English to use this file.\r\nNEW: Now also the Finnish file is included.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAC\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMods like this shouldn't cause VAC alerts:\r\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=637949\r\nI use VAC with my server running this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnyone is free to modify and use this mod's files in their own CSS mods and servers,\r\neven without giving me any credit. Feel free to experiment and enjoy playing CSS. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nWeapon changes from default settings:\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n* Can't see the change without script files installed to
