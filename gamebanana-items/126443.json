I released as a separate map because the changes are quite drastic and the original was 4 months ago.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I would've&nbsp;made something else to put in the background badges but nothing looked good to me, and I salvaged this off mediafire with a decompile anyway so I'm just posting it. Enjoy!"
