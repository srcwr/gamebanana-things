	"_sText": "<b>CS_OFFLOAD_BETA1</b> by RedWood (released September 2009)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The setting of this map is a old railway unloading dock. The facility has been added to repeatedly over the years and it can be seen in the architecture of the structure. The CT's start off in the most modern section and make their way to the T side to rescue the hostages keep under the stairs and in the cargo container. There has a rather wide open but compact play area. If you control the second level you control the map so a good amount of your man power should be concentrate there. It should make for a fun and dynamic check point. Watch out for grenades and have fun.<br>\r\n<br>About Playing with Bots: More or less playable NAV-file is included in archive.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This map far isn't ideal: a lot of empty and low-detailed spaces, some artefacts of the skybox and lightnings in some areas and something else. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>But someone can be pleasant to play on it. And it has the right to receive the audience too, probably... :-)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Good Frags and Good Luck!"
