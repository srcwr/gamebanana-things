This forces players to move from the theater into the arena after spawning.\r\n\r\nThis map is based on the movie Brokeback Mountain(2005). I personally have not seen the film but I bet itâ€™s just like playing this map.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rickets007.com/counterstrikesource/cssmaps/fy_brokeback/index.html\">-www.rickets007.com- fy_brokeback</a>\r\n"
