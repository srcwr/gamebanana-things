	"_sText": "As already mentioned x-tek is an underground facility overrun by terrorists who got a real problem with the research that was done down there. I wanted to first create a map with custom textures, because there are already thousands of maps with the original ones, and secondly do something against this fullbright problem most of the maps have, they are just ridiculously lighted. My map encourages the use of nightvision or atleast tries to. I also wanted it to look better than the most in means of graphic, so hdr and a lots of custom textures (with bumpmaps, specularity and environment maps) are used, this also explains the not quite little file-size.\r\nIt took quite some time to map and design it, please take this into account when you walk trough it, i had no developing team behind me, it's just this one person who did it.\r\nHave fun everybody and give me feedback (;"
