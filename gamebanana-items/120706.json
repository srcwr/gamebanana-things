Questions/reguards go to Corn Ibulus.\r\n\r\nIn this map teams are shot out from all sides of a circular room and freefall until the fan pushes them back up. Players will have to use timing and wit to take out their enemies while monitoring their height.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Uploaded FIXED version. I am deeply sorry for any server inconveniences anybody had. This version should work fine and have no problems with crashing."
