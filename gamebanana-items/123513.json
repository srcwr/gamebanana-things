	"_sText": "I was requested by Bodyguard to make a bigger version of his favorite map, glassfun_csp.  Only thing is, I kinda dislike glassfun_csp.  Thus glass_funzor was born.  Starting from scratch, I created the anchor of the map: the spawns.  Then, remembering how I hated how people blocked the one ladder on the original, I put three ladders instead.  From there on I just kept on expanding.  In the end, I had two underground floors, a roof, two very tall spiral staircases, two extra bombsites, and some very interesting textures.  I think that it's a major improvement on the original.  I also see no reason to acknowledge the original glassfun maker because the only thing I 'took' from him was the glass bricks at spawn.  And glass bricks have been used in all sorts of glass maps. \r\n\r\n"
