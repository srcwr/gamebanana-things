Eveything is running** **smoothly and I hope everyone likes this!                                                                              **\r\n\r\n(Same weapons as in last version)\r\nAs you climb the stairs, each platform will have 4 weapons.  First two platforms are pistols, next two is the subs, then 1 set of rifles.  On the top you can eather pickup a weapon or buy one on the bridge.  The weapons on the top are 4 beasts. (duel elites, deagle, m249, autosniper)\r\n\r\nIt sounds and looks easy, but once you have enough people playing, it's gonna be next to impossible to reach the top.\r\n\r\n*secret button*\r\n\"will allow the other side to be seen\"-Sorry, you gotta find it for yourself though!\r\n"
