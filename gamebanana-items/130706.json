Please click on their name to visit the community's forums and take a look around if you wish. Many of their servers are also running the map if you'd wish to test it.\r\n\r\nThis map is on the small said for an escape map and is in no way complete. As of right now, I do believe it is the best escape map I've made, but the detail does need some work. It just came out of beta after fixing most of the bugs with the map, but the gameplay is good as humans appear to win 45-50% of the time.\r\n\r\nV2 will most likely be released early next month (February 2008), and this version was a prerequisite to this for me. It will include a lot of gameplay improvements, but trust me when I say this map is 100% playable, no doubt about it, and it plays VERY well the way it is now.\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy.\r\nAs always comments, assessments, and stamps are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho\r\n\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative\r\nCreator of Headcrab Hunter 2"
