	"_sText": "FY_Snipertowers is a remake of the same map from Counter-strike 1.6, given a facelift but still has the same rules of gameplay:\r\n\r\nEach team has their own little base, each has two towers with multiple floors, this level is a sniping level as you can guess by the name.\r\nAlthough you do not have to snipe, you can run out of base, run through the market in the center and into the enemys base and kill them by suprise. or just hide out in the market and await for them to come to your base.\r\n\r\nThere are sniperrifles on the ground, and a buyzone on the ground floor of each base\r\n\r\nThe map supports upto 40 players (20 vs 20) It also supports bots that play well. (but they do kill themselves now and then :P)\r\n\r\nHave fun."
