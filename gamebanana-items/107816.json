Don't use the clock at the bottom of the screen: when you open the first door, a special timer will start and do the job for you and show the result at the end... if you can even make it there! :)\r\n\r\nThe timer stops and the results will be shown at the end of the course as soon as you step on the button.\r\n\r\nNote1: To redo the test, reload the map or kill yourself (type \"kill\" in the console\")\r\nNote2: Cheating using noclip and such won't help you on this map.\r\n\r\nYou got the best score and think you pwn us all? Nothing like a screenshot to prove your Leet score is real! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\nLooking for a high detailed action-packed bomb defuse map? Look for my latest map \"The Matrix 1.1\" on all major CS:S web sites like hl2files.com or csbanana.com!\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nMAP INFORMATION:\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nMap Name: aim_leettest\r\nMap Type: AIM (show your skills!)\r\nRelease date: October 28th, 2005\r\nAvailable Weapons: Standard  (pickups)\r\nMap Environment: It's Doctor Kleiner's Counter-Strike Source Testing facility!
