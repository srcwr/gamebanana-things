	"_sText": "A secret military headquarter, previously used for research on various subjects. As the headquarter got old, the military rushed to pack up and move (in all secrecy of course). \r\n\r\nBut in the rush a container got knocked over and the transportation for the remaining facility equipment could no longer be used. \r\n\r\nBecause of this disaster, the officials who are in charge of the headquarter decided to launch their Plan B. The headquarter is therefore now used to train the military's top secret agents.\r\n\r\n(This map is for Counter-Strike: Source)"
