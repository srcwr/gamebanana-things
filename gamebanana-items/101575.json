	"_sText": "This map had been sitting 1/2 complete in my sdk folder for a long time, so I desided to just go and finish it. I thought it came out pretty well, although the lighting is not great! The bomb site was thrown out with almost no thought put into it, because I thought the map would be way too small for two plant sites. NOTE ON THE RADAR OVERVIEW!!!! - Please read this and understand that I didn't merge the files into the bsp because when I finished it, the radar was all white on the transparent area, and I didn't think some people would like that, so I seperated that to make all players happy! There are actually enough spawns for 36 total players, but I don't know how crowded you like your games :p\r\n\r\nThis is my SECOND map, so say what you want and I hope to read good feedback that may help me for my next map which is currently in the begining stages as you're reading this. ENJOY!"
