	"_sText": "This is the final release of de_zenith.  It is a fairly straightforward bomb map with two bomb sites.  It is set in a snowy mountainous area.  The Terrorists spawn at the top of a large hill at the end of a ski lift/gondola.\r\n\r\nSite A is an inside warehouse-ish area with lots of overhead walkways.  Site B is the staple monument of de_zenith.  It has a large radio tower that is visible throughout the entire map.  The tower does collapse when the bomb goes off.\r\n\r\nAs with all of my maps, I concentrated on making de_zenith twist on itself many times so ambushes are possible and multiple different routes can be taken.  Although the elevated walkways throughout the map are loud and put you out into the open, they give you very direct, distance cutting paths between the bombsites.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns, email me at jazzbassking@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n-Oreo"
