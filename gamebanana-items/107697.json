	"_sText": "After trying Hammer Editor for about 5 days, this is the first 'real' map I created. The map consists of 2 buildings with spawnpoints behind it. Every spawnpoint has 3 tables with some m4, ak47 and awp weapons. The players start with a knife and deagle and get to grab a weapon of choice. A couple of tree's, grass, buoy and even a boat makes this map a bit detailed."
