It's a small map meant to promote fast gun play. So hopefully i've succeeded with that.\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by \r\n\r\nChris528. Thanks for the textures.\r\n\r\nSpawn Points: 40\r\n\r\nI added the .nav to the .bsp file, so hopefully it should work, but i've never done it this way before. Any problems let me know :)"
