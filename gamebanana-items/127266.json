	"_sText": "This is a very simple Deathrun map with 3 floors, it doesn't contain a lot traps - but I think it's enough and if it aint, just tell me and I'll upgrade it. I'll love to get feedback, both positive and negative, so just post a comment below.\r\n\r\nThe map contains:\r\n- 9 Traps(Controlled by T)\r\n- 2 Random Traps\r\n- 51 CT Spawns\r\n- 11 T Spawns\r\n- 2 Secrets\r\n- a MP5 at the end with colors, for the first person to end the track\r\n\r\nThis is just a Beta, in the future I'll finish the final version which should be; Longer, different texture, more secrets and more/funnier endings.\r\nThank you."
