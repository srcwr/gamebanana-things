I spent about a week creating this and hope everyone adds it to their servers and plays the hell out of it. The map has textures by sketchy, which present a graph \"paper\" effect with added drawings. Each level is enclosed in a glass box that is \"underwater\". The sky texture, by AmstaFF, gives a feel that the players are underwater.  It's a multigame map consisting of 5 different levels.\r\n\r\n- **Level 1** - Race\r\n- **Level 2** - A updated/modified mg g2 run\r\n- **Level 3** - A modified \"ROCK FALLS OF DEATH\" by 3kliksphilip [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuZhT17TsC8 \"\")\r\n- **Level 4** - Bunny Hop\r\n- **Level 5** - Climb\r\n###### \r\n**MUST** be on a noblock server\r\n###### **MUST** have sv_airaccelerate 120 \r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nPlease comment/rate with constructive criticism. I'm new to mapping and want to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended on a NoBlock server -Come play on ours! -Gamers Guild Original Maps Server![NoBlock|Bhop|FastDL|Starwars] 66.151.244.188:27015"
