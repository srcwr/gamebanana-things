You're in luck, if you haven't installed a map before!\r\nThe instructions for Windows:\r\n\r\n1) Locate your Counter-Strike: Source folder. For most people, this is C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\*YOURUSERNAMEHERE*\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\\r\n\r\n2) Copy or move the .bsp file (the normal map) into the \\maps\\ section of that folder. Basically: C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\*YOURUSERNAMEHERE*\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\\\r\n\r\n3) You're done! There is nothing extra to install, as the extra content is pakratted inside of the .bsp. Enjoy the map!\r\n\r\nThe instructions for Mac/Linux/Other:\r\n\r\n1) Open your web browser.\r\n\r\n2) In the address bar, type in \"www.google.com\"\r\n\r\n3) Google how to install on other operating systems. I have no clue how, sorry, I'm a Windows man myself.\r\n\r\nYou may leave feedback on my Steam profile here, as I'll get the notification: http://steamcommunity.com/id/McBroColi\r\n\r\nAlso, the license is the default one. You can distribute the work to your friends, but please credit me as the author (and note that a few people have custom textures in the map).\r\nYou are not allowed to modify the work in my map and then distribute it as your own. If you would like to help with the map, please get special permission from me on Steam."
