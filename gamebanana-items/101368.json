The maffia should destroy all evidences \r\nand weapons before the police can grab them. \r\n\r\n*****************\r\n\r\nThis map is a defuse / quick-action level, with multiple ways to go to objectives (about a dozen), which make it very interesting to play. In fact the gameplay has been tested on our server during many months, and  the map \"life expectancy\" is great.\r\nTry it, you'll love it. \r\n\r\nThis map is the final version of \"mini_suxor_pro\"\r\n\r\nIt's also available  in gg version. Search for \"gg_carpediem_arena\".\r\n\r\n*****************\r\n\r\n34 slots available. No HDR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor : -|CarpeDieM|- Pit' - August 20008\r\nWeb : http://carpediemcss.free.fr\r\n\r\n\r\n"
