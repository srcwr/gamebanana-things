	"_sText": "**--cs_pilko_estate--**\r\n\r\n**---A hostage rescue map by J4CK8 and Mikeypilk---**\r\n\r\nPilkington Estate is a hostage map based around a German, or Italian (but german police came to the rescue) mansion. The terrorists have taken over the building and are holding the hostages...well...hostage. Counter terrorists must search the building to find the 5 hostages located in and around the mansion and return them to safety. The map consists of 2 floors and a basement.\r\n\r\nThe map was created by me with help and ideas from Mikeypilk. It uses various custom textures take from the \"Textures for the Real world\" pack by TopHATTwaffle (http://www.gamebanana.com/members/144386) and some textures created by myself and Mikeypilk\r\n\r\nThe map includes:\r\n-18 Spawn points per team\r\n-Buyzones for both teams\r\n-5 Hostages\r\n-Custom materials\r\n-Custom radar (Works but is limited*)\r\n-Working nav file\r\n-3d skybox\r\n\r\n*As the map features 2 floors, the radar cannot display both floors and therefore will only display the top floor.\r\n\r\nThis is a new version of previously named cs_mansion. This updated version includes some more details here and there, a new basement entrance from ct spawn and new textures on the building. Some other bugs and fixes also included.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the .BSP files to your cstrike/maps folder."
