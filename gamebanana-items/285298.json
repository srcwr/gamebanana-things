But be carefull not to fall down!<br><br>This is an older map i've been workin on and thought was broken since it took forever to compile... but managed to get it to work finally. Pretty simple (tier 2) and short (~50 second) map. Theres also a short 30 second kz bonus with no checkpoints.<br><br>Big thanks to Saurkk for providing a test server and to the testers Saurkk, suNxprt, Ã‡a Xploz and resQ_Q!<br><br><br>"
