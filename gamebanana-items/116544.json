And thankyou to PlastiC_HEad for compiling this map becuase my poor pc couldnt handle it.\r\n\r\nI looked at an overview of Frostfire and 1 by 1 made this map. Please note it is only a beta and all betas have tiny little errors.\r\n\r\n<b>The screenshots may look a little dark but its better in-game!!!</b>\r\n\r\nHope you like it. I'll soon include a .NAV\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I made the entire map a little brighter!"
