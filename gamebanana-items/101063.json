A custom order by a former administrator at CAL, Randy Paszek, de_asia is a product of a combined effort of several members of the team under the project leadership of our senior level designer Aldéz. The map puts the classic Counter-Strike objective-based gameplay in a unique oriental setting. The map underwent many hours of testing by both the Dimension Studios internal testing team and some members of CAL, until we were all satisfied with its gameplay and aesthetics. \r\n\r\nCredits: \r\n\r\nLevel design: Aldéz \r\nTextures: Aldéz, kow75, the Orion mod team, and CGTextures. \r\nModels: Aldéz, kow75 and the Orion mod team. \r\nSoundscapes: Aleksandr \r\nSounds: kaiho and djgriffin at http://www.freesound.org/ "
