If you break the button, the door will open and a sirena will ring ^^. If a terorrist escapes, they will win because CTs will die XD. In the map you can turnoff lights, open and close doors, play football and water polo. There are a kitchen, a elevator and a room with box. When the map start, CTs are in the parking and Ts in the jails. Ts havenÂ´t got knife so... they have to go to the ktichen^^ to get it. I put a weapon in the jail. "
