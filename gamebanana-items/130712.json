Before you reach the final elevators you will have to use other elevators and cross other obstacles to reach the last elevators.\r\n\r\nOnce you are at the final elevators you will have to make your way to the rescue zone, where there is a radio in which you must use to self destruct the nuclear core bunker in order to stop a wide scale disaster.\r\n\r\n*** JBG_FINAL UPDATE ***\r\n\r\n- Fixes crash, now works with the new css update\r\n\r\n- Few small changes around the map\r\n\r\nThanks To 5unz."
