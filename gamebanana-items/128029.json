Including 3 secret buttons.\r\n\r\n4 Hidden flash bangs to be used by the CT's for defense against the T using the cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object is for the CT's to complete the course without getting blasted by the cannon which is controlled by the T's.\r\n\r\nThere are many different obstacles for the CT's to overcome. The cannon shoots every .75 seconds which allows the CT's to time the cannons shots will hiding behind the various structures.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of the map. Please check it out!\r\n\r\n[Check out the video of my map!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF9Mq94zU-c \"mg_g2_RUN_finalvirgin\")"
