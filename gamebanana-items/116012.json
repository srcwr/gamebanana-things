Especially for them, added roads for the city with sky_camera.<br>Example-3 is turned into a type map “DE” – Bomb/Defuse mission.<br>Example-4 is turned into a type map “CS” – Hostage Rescue mission – on it have been changed the ways, for a more logical approach to this mission.&nbsp; Only for this map the direct corridor was closed. Also the ventilation was closed on one side (<i>–so that there was no disgarmony, that the bots did not get too fast from one side to the other</i>).<br><br>Added a pool with the effect of water, steam and hardened air.<br>Added balcony for tactical use. Plus a special springy board (<i>springboard, yeah, with effects of spring</i>) for jumping into the water.<br>Added additional objects such as lamps external and internal, one dynamic lamp on the rope. Also the barriers on the walls for the entire warehouse. Also trees in the perimeter of the warehouse.<br>Also added other destructible objects from the set of 3D models of “Counter-Strike: Source” and “Half-Life 2”.<br>Added action on bomb triggers to run physics on almost static objects - for greater realism.<br>Added additional opening doors created from scratch. There are doors with an opening up, but there is also a door with side opening (<i>also made from brushes</i>). And yeah, I added the radar images for each map.<br>– Ok, the beginners can find in archive the original map in \"vmf\" format (<i>with other stuff on it</i>) for editing, learning and free using.<br>Enjoy! :)",

I am game developer, but sometimes I do level design for some existing games, to gather experience or to keep fit.<br>Welcome to my maps-examples, each one made by me in a few hours or days (<i>depending on complexity</i>) as examples for learning for beginners. Yes, in this archive are four maps, each having something special:<br>- There is handmade destructible objects (<i>2 types</i>), plus a few rooms with a ventilation system &amp; corridors between them + exploding barrels + sun+sun spot.<br>- In the second example also there is a “3D skybox” with citadel from “Half-Life 2” (<i>+sky_camera</i>).
