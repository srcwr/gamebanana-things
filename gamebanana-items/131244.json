	"_sText": "I created this map when i realized that the zombie mod server that i play on has nothing really placed in the jungle. So, i went and changed that, and put a lot of time into this map. It's not entirely finished yet, though. It's still subject to getting more/changed buildings, more hold and cade spots, and will eventually get a 3D skybox. I released this because people wanted to play it, and i was tired of it just sitting on my computer not being able to be enjoyed."
