	"_sText": "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nSo after getting a lot of feedback on my Olin map, I decided to make a spin off of it. I took everyones complaints, suggestions, and compliments and blended it into what I hope is a better map over all. This map contains many of the aspects Olin had but is blended into something a bit more seamless. As always feedback is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nNote* this being the beta version there is no lighting, I plan on adding it in version one of the map after I see how this one plays out.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n•BHF as always for helping me test this out\r\n•BarneyBoy's Letgo Texture Pack (http://berneyboy.planetquake.gamespy.com/letgo_info.htm) for making an awesome set of textures and saving me loads of time for not having to do em myself ;)\r\n\r\nHope everyone enjoys this!\r\n\r\n=========================================================\r\nV1 Changes:\r\n\r\n•Fine tuned the jump pads for smoother game play\r\n•Increased speed in Hovering Platforms.\r\n•Added some hidden brushes to prevent players from falling to their deaths.\r\n•Blocks removed at top of temple, added ramps to speed up game play\r\n•Other fixes too small to name. \r\n=========================================================\r\nV2 Changes:\r\n\r\n•Added button to spin pink wire around to prevent excessive camping\r\n•Other various tweaks to enhance game play for both sides.\r\n=========================================================\r\nV3 Changes:\r\n\r\n•Drastically dumbed down jump pads and added many preventions to players \r\nflying  to their deaths.\r\n•Sped up game play and added further balancing changes.\r\n•Added 64 spawn points.\r\n•Fixed some texture issues.\r\n•A few other minor tweaks\r\n\r\n*Just a note, this map should play out much smoother now, I have spent a lot of work on the frustrating aspects and balanced out the team play best as possible. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated before I release the final version.\r\n========================================================="
