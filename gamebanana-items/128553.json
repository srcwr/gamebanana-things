	"_sText": "mg_runaway_v1\r\n\r\nIt is a small mini game map, both teams start without a weapon.\r\nThe ground consists of many fields. If you step on them they go down.\r\nAfter a time they will come up again.\r\nThere are special fields where you can stay longer, but after some seconds they will be closed for a long time.\r\nIn the middle of the map is a mp5. But you can not take it.\r\nAfter a while players get damage every second and it will be possible to take the mp5 from the middle of the map. So for example if there are only two players left and nobody wins, the faster one gets the mp5.\r\n\r\nI would be happy if you post your feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\nBananaJoe\r\n\r\n"
