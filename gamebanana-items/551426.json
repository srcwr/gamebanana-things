	"_sText": "My 2nd publicly submitted map! Supports maximum 66 players &amp; includes custom bot navigation meshes.<br><br>A medium-sized Gun Game map. Features above and below ground action, as well as scalable towers for bold players seeking to maximize sight whilst risking personal safety. There's also a few out-of-the-way camping spots for those who've reached the game-winning knife kill phase looking to ambush.<br><br>This map comes in two versions:<br><b><i>gg_pwnpit</i></b><br>&amp;<br><b><i>gg_pwnpit_cheap</i></b><br><br><b><i>gg_pwnpit</i></b> features more scenery and enhanced bot support, but has a larger file size (~21mb total)<br><i><b>gg_pwnpit_cheap</b></i> has a large chunk of scenery cut out and slightly less bot support, but has a smaller file size (~13mb total)<br>I decided to do this because I understand many Gun Game maps feature smaller file sizes as to reduce download time as much as possible. The <i>cheap </i>version is for server hosts who especially value download times.<br><br>I also left the upper balconies accessible via jetpack or low gravity, just for fun. It probably breaks the flow of the map, but who cares lol. I don't think there's a way to get to it beyond these two methods, so vanilla gameplay enjoyers need not worry.<br>"
