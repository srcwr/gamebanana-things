People of a pagan disposition would argue that the number 13 is a lucky number. Play this map and find out for yourselves!\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all of those people who I've unwittingly taken textures and models from.\r\n\r\nGo to rustyinplaces.org and play this on our css server!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Bearbison and the whole of [RIP] Rustyinplaces clan. The best clan in the world!"
