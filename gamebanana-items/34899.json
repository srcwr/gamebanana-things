	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map DE_STEALTH<br><br>Nav Creator: Meurglis3,&nbsp;Release Date: July 15 2016<br><br>Here is the Navigation Mesh for high-detailed military/warehouse themed map <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/191259\">de_stealth</a> by NvC_DmN_CH (created July 2016). It's created from scratch and manually optimized (hand-tuned) .nav-file ('cause original mapauthor's release was not included .nav-file).<br><br>Well... bots use all possible ways now. And they are interested very much about a railway transport and rocket technologies! :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: The most important and insuperable issue - when T-bots drop the bomb to a rocket silo then they die trying to get her from there. But it's a question of bot-psychology instead the nav-making! :D<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:&nbsp; NvC_DmN_CH (for very realistic and fight-friendly atmospheric underground-styled map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:&nbsp; BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),&nbsp; CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Countdown has ceased, power level is nil, the light is green for immediate overkill&nbsp;:-)<br><br>"
