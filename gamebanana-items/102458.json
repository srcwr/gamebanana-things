But the competitors already realized their problem\r\nand commissioned a terrorist group to destroy the main refinery\r\nof NP.\r\n\r\nTerrorists:\r\nPlant the C4 either on the crude oil tanks (spot A) or the train\r\nterminal (spot B), which is filled with containers of the fuel.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists:\r\nPrevent the Terrorists from planting bombs on the premises\r\nof the factory. If they done so, defuse the explosive charges!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nmu][, Tzky for final compile, the ToWar-Clan, Parents, Friends, Scandinavian Metal \\m/, Valve for Half-Life and\r\nHalf-Life 2, my HammerEditor and id-Software for Quake I- and II-Engine,\r\nwhich are the ancestors of so many games!!!"
