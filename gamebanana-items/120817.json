After creating it in a very short time i created a fix (v2) that fixed most things.\r\n\r\nInformation that might help playing the map:\r\n- There are 4 trucks, but only 2 spawnpoints, an admin can do swapteam and teleport to use more trucks if needed.\r\n- The red numbers in the corners of T-spawn are buttons where you can reset the truck, in case of flipping over.\r\n- You have roughly 3,5 minutes to kill all the cts before the nuke strikes and kills the terrorists.\r\n- As terrorists you can use the horn of the truck using your left mouse button."
