I DO RECOMMEND, HOWEVER, THAT YOU UPLOAD 6_6c2 SO IT'S A FIXED AND SLIGHTLY BALANCED VERSION.\r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's new?\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- Improved boss system\r\n- Antispam system\r\n- New level (THE END)\r\n- Filtered glasspanes\r\n- Doors that lock themselves so that griefers can't grief\r\n- Hard level is harder, and the boat is boater\r\n- Transparent water\r\n- Holding time at some places lowered\r\n- Ammo box lag fixed (Hopefully)\r\n- The contest (see below)\r\n\r\nThe contest:\r\n==================\r\n<a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ZPECONTEST \"SteamGroup (Where you should submit your videos/bugs\">SteamGroup (Where you should submit your videos/bugs)</a>\")\r\n\r\nThe contest, as stated in the SteamGroup, consists in submitting a video (upload it to youtube, please) in which you show how you beat THE END. Showing yourself beating MASSACRE's boss is also encouraged, as it will help me decide which should make it to the list in case there are a lot of entries -I doubt this, but well-.\r\n\r\nI suggest you read the whole information at the SteamGroup. Also, As you might have noticed, I have NOT described this new level -I won't-. I want you to legally beat the WHOLE map, and because of that I will only say one thing about the last level: if you fail, you go back to MASSACRE. Sounds hard, huh? We will see. \r\n\r\nPS: There's a way in which you can actually disable that level loss; read what Console says (it might help)."
