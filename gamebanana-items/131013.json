	"_sText": "The map is a space station with 2 spawn rooms.\r\nin each room they are 3 exits, 2 normal exits; 1 by a door and the other 1 by the roof. the 3th exits only opens a few secons before this rooms explode. There's a small room inside the spawn room to hold zombies until the 3th exit opens.  if they \"start\" near you and you cant scape.\r\n\r\nwhen you exit the crew zone ( spawn rooms and some corridors, which explode in 2 mins) you must take the \"huge air vents\" to go to the space port where the bunquer and scape pods are located.\r\n\r\nin the air vents, they are 1 AI sentry gun who shots the zombies to slow down them.\r\n\r\nat the space port, there's a bunquer, with 3 entrances; 1 is the big door, and when it's closed it will never open again; the other 2 are by jumping the wall. In the middle, they are 2 \"control panels\". when you press them, a lasser blocks every1 to enter by about 40 sec, then, they swap their status to off and then need some seconds to be online another time.\r\n\r\nBehind the space port, they are some tunnels. you can enter there by the 3th door at spawn. the tunnel's door will open when the scape pods are ready to fly.\r\n\r\nWhen the scape pods are ready you have 20 sec to enter and hold them (3 scape pods) . If any zombie take a scape pod, they will selfdestruct, so, good luck."
