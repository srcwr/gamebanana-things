If you got any ideas to upgrades on the map or a new map i should try to make please also contact me.\r\n\r\nThis map is a simpel \"aim_deagle\" map where the CT's spawns in the south of the hall and the T's starts in the north, then like alot other aim maps is there alot of box-/crates. The map does also contain 1 secret \"tunnel\" wich you guys can have fun by finding :)\r\n\r\nThanks to all who downloads it."
