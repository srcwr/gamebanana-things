Featuring anti-multiboosts :D\r\n\r\nLevel 1 is difficult in a few parts, but nothing drastic. Level 2 however is for sure tier 6. Don't judge the map until you play it and actually give it a solid go! Don't just take 2 shots, say FUCK THIS and give up. It's hard, but it is enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny and all constructive criticism is welcome, <3\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who helped.\r\n\r\nDon't ever expect a video. Period."
