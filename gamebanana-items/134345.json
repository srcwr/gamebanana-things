They didnt like the color scheme said it was too plan. \r\n\r\nI added some color the the map.\r\nSome props.\r\nLadders.\r\nMade the map a little more difficult.\r\n\r\nAlthough the map looks bigger it's actually the same. There are invisible walls that separate the players from the extended environment. I added the environment as a cosmetic thing.\r\n\r\nU can probably try the map at 74.52.37.5:27016 (Evil Smurft Gun Game Knife Pro server)\r\n\r\nThanks for all the support and GG\r\n\r\nGrubas"
