(that one at screen) ill try make better one as soon i get some ideas.\r\n-added screenoverlay. simple bhop research laboratories logo at left-down corner. (no its not any added afterwards to screenshots. screenshots are non-edited in-game screenshots.)\r\n-remade some models to make lightning look better. tho teleport to 1st level still seems bug on others than me. ill still continue tryes to fix it, but dunno is it possible.\r\n-darkness of some levels is part of gameplay.\r\n-glass break with nades level 5. (cause inbuild antiflash no flash/smoke/blow)\r\n-climb at 6th. (maybe will be changed to bhop in later versions to make it harder)\r\n-more details to spawn and more night feel.\r\n\r\n-map still have no hdr or soundscapes. started make hdr but didnt get it like i want it to be yet. dunno is it even needed so might be that i dont make it. also i have some ideas for sounds / soundscapes but i rly dont want rush with them.\r\n\r\nThats all came to mind now. Please report any bugs u might found.\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSearching:\r\n-sound artist (some wordless songs as background musics/soundscapes)\r\n-texture artist (several different theme packs)\r\n-voice actor (some stuff via voice changer so it sounds like synthetic / computer like.)\r\n-video editor (map teaser videos)\r\n-model artist (some advanced modeling)\r\n-Have some special skills that arent listed here? tell me.\r\n\r\ncontact me if u wanna help^^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nprefabs:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/907 -rotating door by SmJe\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3839 -mustang gt500 by NatalyaAF\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1267 -abstract beamtower by Lost\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/565 -escalator by freshinger\r\n\r\ntextures:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2342 -skybox by [-B-]\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2862 -portal 2 themed texture pack by reacz\r\nwww.kzmod.com -chamber 6 textures and models by Kreedz Climbing mod & Dalai Lama\r\n(asked for developer team and they said yes. that i was allowed use kzmod content doesnt make u allowed to. if u want use them, ask first)\r\n\r\nRest of models and textures are made by me.\r\n\r\nif I forgot something, please tell.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nIf u have any ideas to improve map, please tell me^^\r\n\r\n\r\nsubscribe if you like ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: if u want test map in lan but dont know how change tick after updates of css, read about it from here;\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/tuts/10257"
