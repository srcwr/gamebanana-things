If no, sorry :(\r\n\r\nMap takes place on four floating islands, above the some mountains.\r\nTerrorist and Counter Terrorsit flied here by baloons, which don't really looks like baloons. Terrorist should plant bomb at ancient piramide which is on cloud(A) or in trade port(B), where is CT resp too.\r\n\r\nI have applied some custom textures, but they surely terrible, because they are from google graphic :P . I want to do custom models too, but it gone beyond my capabilities and there wasn't much time so I surrender.\r\n\r\nHm, few info:\r\n\r\n-3D Skybox included\r\n\r\n-HDR included\r\n\r\n-Navigation Mesh included\r\n\r\nI'm barely on time so greatly likely few things can be wrong, so please, if see some, write.\r\n\r\nPlease for rate and comment."
