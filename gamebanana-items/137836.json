	"_sText": "Take a ride through the tunnel of love.<br><br>This map is my submission for the KSF Spring Mapping Contest 2020 in which the theme for the competition was 'sunnyhappylove'. My take on the theme was that of a romantic tunnel of love style ride through several unique environments, ending in a warm, summery beach area. This map is tier 1, with several skips, allowing surfers of all skill levels to enjoy and have fun with the map. A big thanks to everyone at KSF involved in organising and executing this competition, as well as everyone who contributed to the already generous prize pool. Your support for the mapping community is greatly appreciated :)<br><br>3500 maxvel, T1 Linear"
