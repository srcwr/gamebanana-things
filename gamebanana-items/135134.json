	"_sText": "About 200 miles north of Las Vegas on the dawn of a new day, two rival gangs meets at an abandoned storage facility to discuss sour business deals. As they arrive at the location both gangs find the facility enclosed and signs stating that its due for destruction. Fearing betrayal both gangs enter with nerves on the edge and guns drawn..\r\n\r\nMost walls inside the building are destructable. The map is surrounded by an electric fence and also features a garage that can be completely blown up. To blow up the garage look for the sparks on the wall outside by the sheds. The sparks mark a hidden button."
