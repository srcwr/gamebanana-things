	"_sText": "This map is made for 28 players. There is a buy zone at the spawns for each team. At each spawn there are 2 towers that can be acessed by running to the top of the spawn on climbing a ladder. \r\n\r\nThis map is made entirely of the reflectivity texture making it easy to see both teams no matter where they go.\r\n\r\nI tested the map with bots and it worked out very nicely, that's also when I got my screen shots (see pics of map).\r\n\r\nThis map is fairly strategic, but is still a fast map good for gun game."
