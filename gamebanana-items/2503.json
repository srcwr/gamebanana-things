Correct or remove them as you see fit.<br><br>If you do decide to use this prefab in one of your maps, I'd like to be credited as appropriate and while not required, it'd be nice to told so I could see how people have used it.<br><br><center><h1>Need another building for your farm map?<br> Check out my <a href= \"http://www.gamebanana.com/prefabs/5527\">Cluttered Shed Prefab!</h1></a></center>"
