	"_sText": "Hey guys this is my new map, \"bc_ghostpipes\". It is a small snow map with many hills and mounds to climb on or you can go down low to attack for some CQB action. There is also the \"ghost pipe\" as I like to call it, which is invisible to the naked eye until you are inside it. You can swim through it to get to the other side of the map.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 3:56 P.M. 2/4/2012:\r\nI added some walls, adjusted the lighting, and reduced the amount of ghost pipes to only 1 ghost pipe. You can find it behind 2 half-buried crates in each spawn.\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nPlease have fun, and give me feedback on what you want me to add or remove from this map! \r\n\r\nThanks for everyone who sees this page."
