The goal is to jump\r\nas much as you can ;) But not longjump. I wondered if it's possible\r\nto make any kind of highjump in source and it's possible.\r\nYou jump it like longjump, but i think it's more difficult.\r\nI didn't test it much, but did 215 block :) \r\n \r\nWhen you jump something difficult(my opinion)\r\nit will play sound... From 212 - 214 it's Impressive\r\n                      From 215 - 218 it's Perfect\r\n                      From 219 - 220 it's Wickedsick\r\nand legendary blocks in separated room(225 and 230) plays sound GOOOOODDDDLIIIKE\r\n\r\nTHIS MAP WAS MADE TO BE PLAYED WITH DEFAULT CSS SETTINGS!!!\r\n\r\nGL & HF improving your lj and now hj (but still lj xD) skills :)\r\n\r\nMap by ---N00B---K!LL3R---"
