Since the contest I have been busy with exams amongst other things, so mapping hasn't really been a high priority (Hence the late release). The contest was quite fun and I advise anyone with an active interest in mapping to participate next year :).<h2><a href=\"http://www.tophattwaffle.com/?p=1067\">THIS YEARS RESULTS!</a></h2><h2>A few Features of this map:</h2><b>+High FPS\r\n+HDR\r\n+78 Spawns\r\n</b><h1><a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/responders/addtofavs?section=maps&itemid=138445\">Fav this map!</a>\r\n<a href= \"http://www.fpsbanana.com/responders/addtowl?key=pKN15fJ66PTpduqOViPJD91wWpkKsplv/jvm&section=users&itemid=699321\">Watch me as a submitter :)</a></h1><strong><a href=\"http://www.game-monitor.com/search.php?search=gg_power&type=map\">Servers which might be running this map</a></strong></center>\r\n"
