	"_sText": "Description\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is my fourth map I created for Counter-Strike: Source. It is a recreation of the Half-Life map \"hlk_killbox\" by [HLK] Slayer. Since I think\r\nthis map has great potential I want to distribute it to further games like Counter-Strike: Source and soon also Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Although\r\nI wanted to keep the atmosphere as much as possible I took the chance to give it a fresh new look as you can see - shiny floors and walls, great\r\nlighting and a clean environment give it a new fancy appeal.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n========\r\n\r\nSince it is mostly an optical recreation the structure of the map has not changed, leaving wide open areas to the player. I recommend to ban\r\nsniper rifles if you are hosting a server. And for the height... Do not be afraid to simply jump! Try it out!\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nExtract the bsp-file from the zip folder into the directory\r\n\r\n**C:\\programs\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps**\r\n\r\n(default Steam directory)\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n========\r\n\r\n**Any feedback will be appreciated!** Tell me which visual changes I should do next time I recreate another map. What do you like\r\nespecially about the fancy look of the map? Does it fit well? What should I have done better in your opinion? I would love to know!"
