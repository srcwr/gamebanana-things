	"_sText": "I wasn't planning to map much anymore but I really wanted to do something for Halloween, my favorite holiday. Didn't spend that long on this tbh, but it looks pretty good, has effective ambience and is very smooth to run with decent gameplay. Main map is around 1:20 casually, and there's a short bonus from a friend of mine. Oh by the way, map has a little gimmick with old bhopper's names on the gravestones (sorry in advance if any of them still play lmao)<br><br>Cheers and happy early halloween :^)<br><br>also thanks to tumi for vid, it felt needed since it was hard to show much of the map with screenshots due to the fog.<br><br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/smgNdww00fc\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
