	"_sText": "First (and probably only) release of my new map Sketchland. The map was originally only started as a demo of my new Sketchy textures pack which I will release at some point in the future, but I've decided to upload it now as it is indeed playable. The sky/light_env are terrible, i know, but again, the focus wasn't on effects, just textures.\r\n\r\nYour game might tell you that the nav mesh was made with a different version of the map, but it wasn't. I had to rename it when I packed it all together with PAKrat. This does have a custom NAV mesh, but it's the first time I've ever attempted to do a custom mesh, so it isn't very good (only really added the ladders and fixed areas where bots tended to get stuck).\r\n\r\nVideo Preview:\r\nhttp://www.xfire.com/video/8fbdb/"
