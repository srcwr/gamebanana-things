	"_sText": "My Second serious map, took about 2 weeks to make this map. \r\n\r\nBomb site in middle, sniper locations covering it from all angles. Bomb site is on the bridge over a large chasm, with two smaller bridges on either side. However, the two small bridges are rigged with explosives and will blow if triggered by another player.\r\n\r\nPlenty of cover from snipers in open area and lots of room to move.\r\n\r\nNo I do not want a nav file.\r\n\r\nOne texturing mistake, however, i'm to lazy to re-compile the whole thing over it. Other than that, I hope someone will enjoy this map.\r\n\r\n"
