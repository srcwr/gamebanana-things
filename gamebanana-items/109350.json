There are 2 orange bits in the water, thats incase you fall/jump in and want to get back up, they will teleport you back up. \r\n\r\n<b>I ran build cubemaps and it didnt do anything, so if you do it and it works then go ahead and lemme know</b>\r\n\r\nalso this was initally an idea i came up with when i was a little kid, when my parents got divorced i started to draw to get it off my mind, and i drew something like this, and i found it a while back and i decided to make it a map.
