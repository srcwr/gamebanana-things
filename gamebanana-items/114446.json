This map was made to have a \"real\" map feel to it, with its use of textures and props. There are three routes to the enemy base; head-on,sewer, or a ledge on the rockface. The materials act normal, so don't expect the thin metal bunkers to protect you THAT much :-P \r\n\r\nBugs: I'm sure if you look well, there are some things I missed.\r\n\r\nComments: This is the first map I'm realeasing, Hope everyone enjoys it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired Items: Steam and Counter Strike: Source\r\n\r\n***********************************"
