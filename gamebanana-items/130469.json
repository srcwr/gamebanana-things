	"_sText": "There is an open arena and a tunnel. You can use teleportation for going between these two.\r\n\r\nThere is a catapult (I couldn't find any other way to describe it :D) which is synced with its counter part. When first player enters, it waits five seconds for someone else to enter the one at the opposite side, if someone enters in 5 seconds they are immediately launched meeting at the center. After 5 seconds if nobody enters the other catapult, you launch alone.\r\n\r\nRoofs of the shacks in the middle pushes people so people can't wait on them. Because of this you can jump long distances and land on enemy players.\r\n\r\nThe top side path doubles the speed of the players. There are hazard markers on the ground to see when the speed is activated and disabled.\r\n\r\nThere is a teleporter from the water to the top side path.\r\n\r\nInside the tunnel you have 2x speed and flickering lights. When you reach the other side of the tunnel you come out from the enemy base.\r\n\r\nOne of the shacks has a suprise from HL2 :)) and the tunnel has one from Batman.\r\n\r\nHope you like it, sinsic."
