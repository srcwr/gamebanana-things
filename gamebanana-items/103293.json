	"_sText": "I finished this version of the map quite a few months ago.  I thought I had lost it in a reformat but the .bsp turned up when I was cleaning out my webserver.  Luckily the version was the latest and optimized version of all my progress to date.  I had originally planned on making the map larger after this initial stage was done.  However, all that was on the server was the .bsp, no editing files.\r\n\r\nIt is a map made for nightvision mostly.  That $1200 investment will actually be beneficial for once.  It is also designed for smaller matches. 4-12 players offer the best play experience.\r\n\r\nA good amount of alternate pathways are available for those who search.  Look for ladders, conveniently piled boxes and a well placed board."
