The day version provides high visibility and is closer to the original and version 2. The night map dramatically reduces visibility and helps train closer combat.\r\n\r\nSend any suggestions/compliments/complaints to mrdevage@gmail.com or add me on Steam; paperdrawing@yahoo.com and invite me to play on your server.\r\n\r\nCredits go out to the author of the original 3mc_training."
