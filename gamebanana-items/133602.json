It's made mostly for gun game\r\nbut does work for normal play. Also notice, it is meant for online play. Playing with bots won't work well because for some odd\r\nreason they like to jump off and die. I don't know why, they\r\njust do that. Either way have fun :)\r\n\r\nNOTE: I haven't tested it with real people. When you do (If you do) please e-mail me (wurmy1029@yahoo.com) and send comments of the map. Thanks!\r\n\r\n- Kill3rTomato\r\n[EVOL] Clan.\r\n\r\n(This is also in the ReadMe, mostly)\r\n"
