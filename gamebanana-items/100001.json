Cts spawn at the street where they can hide behind the car and awp or just  simply go up the rope and go through the escape window and pwn the ts also they can rush into the house. The fences at the house area breakable yet 2 aren't. OH and theres a garage with weak light just for fun and u can climb on top of it i hope you guys enjoy my map it took me 2 weeks to do this So i hope you all like it i know cs = hostage rescue but lets say the terrorists killed the hostages when the cts got their.\r\n\r\nts objective SURVIVE and kill the cts\r\ncts SURVive and kill the ts \r\nHAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nbtw ts bots are dumb \r\ncts are kinda smart and ts are less smarter because i guess all they can think about is BOMB THE DAMN CTS!!!! kalalalalla im joking but maybe..\r\nHey and i also customized the bots nav/ mesh so ill add that in there\r\n</FONT>"
