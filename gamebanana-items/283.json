	"_sText": "Started off strong, but compiles took too long, even with most of the bridge func_detailed, I'm not a pro at optimization, and this would be too much work to optimize professionally in my opinion; so I stopped.\r\n\r\nBased off the Bridge level in the console shooter 'BLACK'. It's a destroyed war torn bridge with blow up cars and craters in the road, there is a pedestrian catwalk below the road as well as the service pathways leading to the top of the bridge where an awp will be placed. AS you can see in the name this was meant to be CTs with AUGs vs Ts with Sig 552s. \r\n\r\nEventually I would have added a skybox containing the fog and water below along with a burning war torn city in the distance at both ends of the bridge. \r\n\r\n<fieldset>A Georgian militia group in Eastern Europe has ravaged an entire bridge, killing hundreds, destroying cars, and threatening to destroy the bridge itself to halt Russian forces from eradicating several terrorist groups in Chechnya. The NATO has been given the go ahead to assist the Russians in this operation and secure the bridge.</fieldset>"
