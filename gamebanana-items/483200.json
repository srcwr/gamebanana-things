Please test it on CS:S and let me know if it can't be completed for any particular reason in the game. Otherwise this map is very hard and very un-fun.<br><br>No checkpoints.<br><br>Maybe 2 - 3 mins long.<br><br>Somewhere between tier 7 and tier 9. I don't think anybody can do a full run, but segmented and TAS are very possible. <br><br>edit: Map has now been beaten by player Triedsame! GG<br>"
