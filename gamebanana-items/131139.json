	"_sText": "BREAKFLOORZM_FIXED\r\n\r\nThis is the second release of breakfloorzm.\r\nThis release fixes various bugs and graphical glitches with the original.\r\nIt also has been further optimized for better FPS and less lag.\r\nThe map also now works on Linux servers.\r\n\r\nThe entire point of this remake is that users are automatically teleported back to the top of the map if they fall into the pit below the breakable floor. This way, users don't need to type or bind !ztele or any of that, and the gameplay will therefore be much better. Of course, there will also be less chat and mic spam as a result.\r\n\r\nCredit for the original breakfloor goes to tstar.\r\nThis map was made for ZombieMod breakfloor servers.\r\nIt was also originally a request by a ZM fan.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. =D\r\nComments, assessments, and stamps are more than welcome.\r\nJust be sure to try out the map!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nÂ£cho\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative"
