This allows the mapper to play with many light settings such as indirect lights coming from corners or spawning behind objects. Together with the contrast colors black and grey the pink neon stripes look even better!\r\n\r\nI hope you like the style and design of this map and give me nice suggestions for my next release of this map.\r\n\r\nMuch thanks to Zerberus and his idea-help and x-X^ for all the support!\r\nAlso thanks to my testers for the time you spent.</b></font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=http://krustyworld.de>www.krustyworld.de</a>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=http://i485.photobucket.com/albums/rr212/zakk-man/krusty.png></center>"
