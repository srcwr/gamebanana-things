	"_sText": "This is a map sort of inspired by blue arena, but it really isn't that similar. There's a lot more hallways on the inside, making the map less open. Also, the top has holes in the floor making it easy to surprise someone on the bottom level. I decided to give the map a futuristic wasteland theme to make it a bit different than blue arena.\r\n\r\nThanks to .Eric for his awesome texture pack, karatekaefer of Nucleus studios for his many great skyboxes, and of course mck-76 for making the original blue arena.\r\n\r\nPlease provide feedback. If you upload it to your server or use it to make another map, I'd love to hear about it through a private message or by posting here."
