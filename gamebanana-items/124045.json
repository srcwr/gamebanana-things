It is set within small arenas with objects placed tactically forcing you to use skill to eliminate your enemies. The close quarters offer intense gunfights.\r\nThese are texture maps. All maps are made for a maximum of 12 players. \r\nMost of these are indoors but there are also two outdoor maps (a little bit bigger) in respective day and night.\r\nAll maps have buyzones and a nav file. I will also release all maps individually soon.\r\n\r\nIf you (dis)like the maps or have suggestions/improvements please comment. These maps are probably also suitable for gungame and/or deathmatch maps.\r\n\r\n========\r\n<b>Objective:</b>\r\n========\r\nUse the objects and environment to beat your enemies in gunfights. Pure skill will save you from getting that one headshot you didn't deserve...\r\n\r\n========\r\n<b>Instructions:</b>\r\n========\r\n\r\n1. Unzip the contents your <b>cstrike</b> folder\r\nfolder (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\Valve\\Steam\\accountname\\counter strike source\\cstrike\\).\r\n</center>"
