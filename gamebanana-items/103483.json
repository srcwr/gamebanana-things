Bombsite A is more open but has a lower area underground to help cover it, bomb can be planted on roof aswell. Access to high vantage points everywhere and a few small areas with vent access too! \r\n\r\nBuild notes: about 80 hours, first time using Hammer (so it's my first complete map), learned a lot while making this level, and enjoyed doing so. Concentrated on gameplay/balance more then looks, wanted to keep framerate as high as possible for an large outdoor area map.\r\n\r\nThanks to chizbone for the .nav!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"
