Simple :3<br>Map supports up to a 30v30 (Not 100% positive about that though, I'm pretty sure it has a total of 60 spawn points, just divide them by CT and T and you'll have a 30v30.)<br>Have fun. &nbsp;(You'll need to use certain commands to actually make an idle server if you plan to such as max money and stuff. This is not an AIO Achievement Idle map, not sure if those exist though.)<br><br>Bugs (Too long to put into the Bug Reports section.):<br>During map load, console is spammed about 20 lines saying that some CT and T spawn points are invalid. They should work fine though. I think the reason for this is because the player spawns inside the gun props which you can still move and stuff through them so I don't think this is a big issue."
