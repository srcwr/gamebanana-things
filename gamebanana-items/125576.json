The blocks are at the positions where the world recorder holder \"Loof\" jumped on.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the bonus is removed because it seemed distracting which probably made people get less speed on it.\r\n\r\nThe map was created to see if the few blocks to focus on increase the ability to get a better time, or if it will be the same as on the original bonus. This map also serves to practise your strafing and one day complete the whole map without prejumping.\r\n\r\n**Changed the texture for less distraction**\r\n- It might look bad for the normal taste but it will help seeing the blocks better"
