For the mean time, the Library has not got any props inside. still, a fun area to mess about in. I am willing to make adjustments to this map, but like i state below, I am NOT a mapper and this is my first map ever.\r\n\r\nI apologize with the delay in the update. I had tried to compile a version for you guys to download a lot sooner but had errors in hammer which i had to sort out first.\r\n\r\nNone-the-less, enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map features an outside area which can be used for both, Assault and Sniping (Gmod or CSS). \r\nWalking into the TARDIS front viewpoint will teleport you to the interior.\r\n\r\nInside the TARDIS, you will find:\r\nConsole Room\r\nSwimming Pool\r\nAnti-Gravity Chamber\r\nCinema\r\nLibrary\r\nUniversal Prision\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits to:\r\n\r\nTyson Dostal for allowing me the use of the 'Library' and 'Cinema' from HIS TARDIS Interior Map:\r\nhttp://gmod.gamebanana.com/maps/163965\r\n\r\nTheSniper9 for allowing me to use his Doctor Who and TARDIS interior models:\r\nhttp://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a...\r\n\r\nI do not class myself a mapper of any sort so please no requests, however, I am willing to listen and \r\nmodify THIS map from any Ideas/Crits you guys may have.\r\n(Just..please don't ask me to redo the tunnels.. they are badly carved and was a pain in the arse for \r\nsomeone with no experience in mapping) \r\n\r\nThis is the Matt Smith Interior for the TARDIS. I based the layout to the PSHome Network BBC Official \r\nTARDIS (downloadable as a home). I consider this the most, if not the only, legit version of the TARDIS \r\nas it is made by the BBC... Doctor Who shown by the BBC.\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever map, please be Gentle :)"
