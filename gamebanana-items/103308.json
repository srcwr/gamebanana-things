There are some exploits possible that for some reason can't be fixed (I tried. My map test refuses to update now.), some are good for you, others will kill you. It's up to you to find that part out. Some are put there on purpose to hurt people who stick their nose in exploits. :P\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy. From now on they'll only get bigger and better!\r\n\r\nPlease, if you have any problems besides the exploits or any tips on how to make the next one better please tell me."
