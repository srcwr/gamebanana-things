	"_sText": "NOTE: On server startup this map might freeze you for a couple seconds don't worry just wait it out its not long at all.\r\nNOTE: Don't let the cars look fool you its extremly hard to drive.\r\nThis is my first Zm map with a working Truck, the \"Safe Truck\" is totally impenitrable no zombies can get in as long as you lock the doors and stay away from edges. Now on the sides there are little side windows these can be opened with the buttons in the middle of them. If you happen to see any pairs of buttons with One on top of the other the top one locks and the bottom one unlocks. This map mostly favours the humans with its safe hanger and truck but I'm hoping it lvls out with the darkness and easy ways of getting on buildings. There are 20 to 25 elevated locations that you can go on, 2 barricade locations, 1 impenitrable location, a hanger base, and 5 to 6 alleyways for hiding. This is probablly the best looking city map your gonna find for Zm at this point in time."
