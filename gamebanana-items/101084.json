We can only speculate as to what has been found (there has been talk of alien spacecraft and lost cities) but it is obviously something of great importance.\r\n\r\nHowever, curiosity is now turning to concern. Whilst still no official statement has been forthcoming, reporters and observers have noted a dramatic change in activity aournd the site in recent days. All \"scientific\" traffic has been stopped and large numbers of people have been moved out of the \"quarenteen zone\" (10 miles around the site) The only people who have been seen going towards the site are military and special forces operatives.\r\n\r\n* Counter-Terrorists: Save Atlantis...\r\n\r\n* Terrorists: Destroy this underwater paradise\r\n\r\n\r\n> Special credit room underneath the map.\r\nI would like to thanks Gmaps alot for putting so much time into this map, specially last few days he worked day and night on it so it just reached the deadline!!\r\n\r\n<FONT COLOR=\"78ff00\">**Gmaps on FPSB:**</FONT> [Click here.](http://www.gamebanana.com/members/851542 \"Click here.\")\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font color=white><b>READ ME</b></font></legend>\r\nExtract this .RAR into your Cstrike folder, replace if asked.\r\nIt is important that you do this, otherwise parts of the map will not work!!\r\nPlease dont delete the .res file, it's needed for people who download \r\nthe map off a server to download external custom content from the map!!</fieldset>\r\n\r\nRemember we made this map in less than 40days !\r\nThanks for playing!"
