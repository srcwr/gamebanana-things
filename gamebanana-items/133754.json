I've added soundscapes, a 3D skybox, and a few other details.\r\n\r\nJust copy the map .bsp and its .nav into the 'cstrike/maps' folder and you should be up and running. If you have a missing texture, copy the included texture files into the 'cstrike/materials' folder. If there is no ambient sound, your going to need to put the scripts in the 'cstrike/scripts' folder. Create this if you don't already have one in the 'cstrike' folder."
