	"_sText": "At first I wanted another texture map like aim_ag_texture_2, but realized where my skill boundaries we're, although some might say aim_ag_texture_2 isint hard to make, it's certainly got good gameplay structure (Besides it being T sided lol). Here's a map I created inspired by a paintball field I saw on google images. I'm not the best of map creators so there are minor flaws. The skybox can be better, and there are some shadow errors, but It's a BETA map for now. Updating it soon if it becomes popular. ENJOY!"
