At first I tried to make this as a self taught lesson, and as I progressed I thought it looked pretty nice. I suggest you try this in game because it looks better there.</ul\r\n\r\n<b><u>Guidelines</b></u>\r\n<ul>You can re-texture this as you wish, also you may add some things to this, but please put my name in the credits. Apart from that you can use this in your map.</ul>"
