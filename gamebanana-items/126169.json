I wanted to make a bonus by myself, but pcpie had one for me which he wasn't planned to use anyways. </p><p>The map is between 40-50 seconds long and the bonus 7-9 seconds, something like that.</p><p>I hope you guys will enjoy the map :)</p><hr class=\"SelectedElement\"><p>[EDIT]:</p><p>The missing textured tree has been fixed now. 9 people has probably a missing textured tree, just download the map again.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
