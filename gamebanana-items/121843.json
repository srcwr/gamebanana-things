Their objective is to eliminate the other team.\r\n\r\nWeapons in the map: \r\n- M4A1\r\n- AWP\r\n- M3\r\n- Deagle\r\n- Knife\r\n\r\nPlayers are immune to fall damage, please let me know if I have to remove that, since I'm not sure if it makes gameplay too easy.\r\n\r\nThe map doesn't contain a jail, maybe something to work on in the sequel (if comments are positive ;))\r\nPlayers can telehop by surfing in the 'top' teleport. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think of it :D"
