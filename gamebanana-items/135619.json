A tower with a sniper spot for those hard scout and awp levels. Underground provides instant action. A SECRET AREA great for escaping a player on knife level providing you know where it is. Plenty of space for heavy amounts of players. The black and white stripes are obviously ladders if you couldn't tell. Yes it is fullbright i tried adding even a lot of light and env light, the reason for this is because when you add lights it makes considerably darker making it nearly impossible to see black on black. fullbright provides just the right amount of light. Enjoy, please leave a comment or thoughts. _______________ GL&HF"
