One terrorist has a set of 20 buttons randomly spread that corrospond to the glass tiles. Once he pressed the button that tile will go red and kill whoever is on it. You then get teleported back to a room where you have to choose another room to go in.\r\n\r\nIf the Terrorist is fast at presseing the buttons; then he can take out around 17 tiles. If you are lucky enough to survive then feel free to shoot him in the head or slowly watch him die by pressing the button.\r\n\r\nNOTE: You have 5 seconds to leave the room with the doors in once you are teleported there.\r\n\r\nAlso mp_limitteams 0 is required.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nPaul_Deagle (aka [SG] Paul)\r\n\r\n"
