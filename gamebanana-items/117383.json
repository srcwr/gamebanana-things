My computer wont' let me take screen shots with steam so I had to do it with an actual camera and upload them to my computer, so to make up for teh crappy screen shots, i've included a video.\r\n\r\nThis map was made from my origonal map dm_gg_western. The origonal was lacking things such as cover and the buildings weren't made right. So I fixed it all up, added a few things, changed the lighting and finished the map. The newer version is way better than the older one, although the older one is better for scouting than the new one. \r\n\r\nThis map holds 40 players, has buy zones and a .nav file. \r\n\r\nHere's a short video of my map:\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/7GF84wcTLjk&rel=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/7GF84wcTLjk&rel=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>"
