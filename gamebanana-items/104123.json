	"_sText": "De_stock conveys a warm, maritime atmosphere, inviting you to extend your summer holidays by having a swim in the deep blue sea. Terrorists start from behind the factory, which is served by train, while CT spawn is located throughout the quay. There are 4 to 6 different paths to get from one end of the map to the other.\r\nVery different from de_port, de_stock has pleasant graphics and a worth-seeing structure. Much attention has been paid to the sound environment with the addition of 6 hi-fi wav sounds not contained in the gcf."
