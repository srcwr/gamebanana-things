	"_sText": "This specific puzzle game-type, Haunted Survival, was created by TPSKJarhead and credit is given. This is a newly created game-type so more ad more HS maps will soon be created. Look forward for to some new scary puzzle maps.\r\n\r\nThis is a super-fun puzzle map where you go from room to room solving little puzzles and escaping death at every turn. After going through rooms upon rooms of puzzles, you can either go two different pathways. So the fun never ends. The map is pitch dark, except for the few lights that slightly keeps up visibility, to add suspense and keep it haunted. Enjoy."
