	"_sText": "THIS IS NOT THE SAME WATERWORLD THAT IS ON HERE.  I'VE HAD THE SAME NAME FOR MONTHS AND JUST REALIZED THERE WAS ANOTHER.\r\n\r\nThis is version 1.0 of my map, FY_Waterworld.  I'm not sure if there will be another version, but it helps to seperate from the other one I saw on here.  In fact I'm unsure if I put the right tag in front, but it's done and over with.\r\n\r\nThis map is a customized version of the Waterworld map from Resident Evil 4.  It's been modified to fit with the style of Counter-Strike with added cover, boxes, and ladders set around the map.  This is to hopefully detour SOME sniping, but I doubt that will keep people from pulling out the insta-kill guns.\r\n\r\nJust want to note a couple things...\r\n-Grates and windows are destructable\r\n-There is no bot nav\r\n\r\nI am by no means a master mapper since this was only my second map.  Please give any helpful tips or comments that may help improve things and do report any bugs that cause problems.  I'm hoping this will lead to making another map with renewed vigor.\r\n\r\n*UPDATED IMAGES*\r\nAlso I looked at the map again after not looking at it for awhile and the texture glitches I thought were there are now gone.\r\n\r\nIF YOU DOWNLOAD THIS MAP, PLEASE POST SOME FEEDBACK.  I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW WELL IT RUNS WITH 10 TO 20 PEOPLE AND IF THERE ARE ANY MAJORS CHANGES THAT WILL BE NEEDED."
