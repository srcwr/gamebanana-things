CT's spawn on one side, T's spawn on the other.\r\nOn top of the wall sits a small snipers nest, with a ladder leading to it from both sides of the wall.\r\n\r\nA rotating 'conveyor belt' sort-of thing surrounds the spawn areas.\r\nThe rotating platform is designed to travel from one spawn area to another, but can be used for drive-bys if you are inclined to do so.\r\n</div>\r\ngg_rotadome_v3 updates the previous maps in the series by adding various LDR lighting effects (all static, so don't worry about your FPS), a sunken rotating platform covered with water (44 units high), an open-roofed circular wall surrounding the play area, fixed ladder, increased player limit and more.\r\n\r\nThis is a fun, fast-paced and innovative GunGame map that players will love."
