If you need more then leave a comment with the number of spawns that you need and I will make them for you.\r\n\r\nNO DECOMPILING THIS MAP!!  \r\n\r\nBased in the winter, the map has two main ways to go: the upper house thingy or through the woods, over the hills to grandma's house we go.  The hills is definetly the hardest place to play on the map.  I added one scout at each spawn so that the scouters that hate awps can have their share of fun too.  The fog adds an extra obstacle to the entire map.  \r\n\r\nThere is one hidden thing/easter egg in the map.  I WILL NOT TELL YOU AND IT IS FOR YOU TO FIND OUT!!!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for/about the map, pm me or leave a comment here.  \r\n\r\nPlease understand that this is only the v1 and that a final version will come within a month including the following:\r\n\r\n1: 3D skybox\r\n2: improved indoor enviroment\r\n3: fixed \"rough\" hills\r\n4: maybe a new route through the upper area\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: lime; text-align: center; font-size: xx-large;\">PLEASE ASSESS!!</p>"
