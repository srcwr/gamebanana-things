	"_sText": "MAP: aim_ag_brutal_warzone\r\nAUTHOR: Vacuum (Will)\r\n\r\nA skill oriented map that features two large, main buildings near each spawn. These buildings are connected by two long, winding roads that go through the map. Each spawn has its own quirks; terrorists have quick access to an underground area that leads eventually back to CT spawn and can also take many other routes to different areas. The counter-terrorists are able to quickly gain a sniper's post and then move out into T spawn and all around the map.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to design this map to force every single player to move around constantly, making this map largely skill and team oriented. The possibility that a team will be able to hold a certain area consistently throughout the entire round is not likely, and therefore team mates must communicate.\r\n\r\nThis map is suitable for large or small team-play, making it also very good for clans of any size."
