	"_sText": "A small map with two towers and a big crystal in the middle. \r\n\r\nThis map was build for quick central combat but also to have good sniper locations. Players are also able to jump down on top of the sides of the play area if they wish. \r\n\r\nRather than using ladders I did steep stairs (16 high and 4 deep) which allow the player to ascend very fast and go down as fast as you can fall.\r\n\r\n<b>I'm considering making a normal textured version of this map... If you would like me to do that, let me know.</b>"
