I saw the rough concept that was being used by XBox and tried to bring it to a top class level. \r\n\r\nThis is beta 4 of the map, so I thought I would share with folks outside the [http://fnggaming.net](http://fnggaming.net \"http://fnggaming.net\") community; The intended style is to be a very fast paced map that people blow through."
