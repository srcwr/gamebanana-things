	"_sText": "gg_chapel - a GunGame custom map\r\n\r\nA small European chapel is invaded by Terrorists.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Edited *.nav file so locations have names\r\n- Small, simple map\r\n- Level overview\r\n- Cubemapped, lighted, etc.\r\n- Pakratted, so there's only one file to download\r\n- Buyzones so you can play it without the GunGame addon\r\n- 48 total spawn points (but I don't recommend playing with that many, it's a small map)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map was created in about 4 days, but I spent at least 4-5 hours each day working on it. One day I spent over 10 hours working on it. I have a lot of free time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, please constructively criticize. Thank you."
