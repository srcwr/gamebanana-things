There are some darker spots than others (maybe camp in the dark places?)\r\n\r\n\r\nTextures are a little different that what people are used to, but I\\'m always trying something new.\r\n\r\nThere are 40 player slots, FPS rate is pretty good.\r\n\r\n.bsp and .nav are included in the .zip file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would be my second map published to the public :)\r\n\r\nHappy gaming everybody!"
