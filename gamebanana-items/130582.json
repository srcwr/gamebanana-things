	"_sText": "v1_9 is out! 'tiny update just to add more fun to end'\r\nit changes the end fort abit to make it more fun, and has fixed some of the problems it had before. Note, this is only a small update, and dose not fix any bugs 'no bugs to fix' so only update to this one if you want to make the ending more fun.\r\n\r\nv1_8b is out!\r\nFixed a number of bugs, and have made the spawn less laggy. Note, i have fixed one bug that hardly any one knows about, this bug can kill the game if found out. So i deeply suggest updating to v1_8b to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nBut on another note, this map was made for a challenge ageanst The-Gregster-101. In this challenge we hope to replace the old Boat Escape, with something more better looking and more fun to play on. I allready seen Gregster map and it alot of fun to play on, so if you havent seen it yet give it ago if its on a server."
