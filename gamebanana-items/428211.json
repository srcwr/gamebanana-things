	"_sText": "hello folks<br><br>two maps; bhop_atrium2 and bhop_overnight<br><br>atrium2: somewhat of a successor to atrium1 but a lot better imo. it is strafey with bits of technicality sprinkled into it. halfway through the map will split into two major separate routes. both are pretty fun imo. 22 ~ 25 seconds<br><br>overnight: name derives from the fact that I made this entire map overnight in about 7 hours. ironically this is probably my favorite map in terms of gameplay. I think it is very fun. overnight also splits into multiple routes throughout the map. 35 ~ 45 seconds<br><br><br>huge thanks to trickster and loaf for testing atrium2<br><br>hmu if interested in showcasing either map, and let me know if there are any issues<br>enjoy"
