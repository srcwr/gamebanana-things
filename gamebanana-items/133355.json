Both Teams have 2 Spawn areas and can decide if they want to go into one of the tunnels or attack in one of the connections.\r\n\r\nthe spawn areas are marked with blue (CT) and red (T) light.\r\n\r\nI Hope you will have fun with it and I would appreciate, if a serverhost would test it on his GunGame server\r\n\r\nP.S: It is still Beta and the Pictures are from the first Beta"
