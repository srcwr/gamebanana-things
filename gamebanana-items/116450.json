This is my first map, so I'd like to explain it!\r\n\r\nPOWER is a sort of map I made for CS:S (because I fail and can't make a mod).\r\n\r\nPOWER maps focus on two sides making it to one focal point that connects both sides, giving either team the advantage. The focus of POWER maps is to use the different classes as a team to \"take\" the focal point and have the advantage over the other team.\r\nThere are four \"classes\" in POWER maps:\r\n3 Technicians - They have machine guns and are decent overall. They are used for backing up other players and leading assaults.\r\n3 Snipers - They have sniper rifles and excel in range. They are used for taking out enemies from a distance.\r\n3 Guards - They have pump shotguns and excel in damage. They are used for guarding the focal point of the map and assisting in assaults.\r\n1 Special Ops - They have a silenced sub-machine gun and excel in stealth. Their uses are varied.\r\n\r\n...umm...yeah. Sorry for it sounding stupid, but give it a try! ^_^;"
