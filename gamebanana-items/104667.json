The BSP file includes .nav and radar overviews etc.  I didnt have a good name for my map lol so just decided to go with my name+map. \r\n\r\nFor up to 46 players (can add more if required on request)\r\nThe map has 2 bomb sites...the bunker and the bank which I've tried to keep equally balanced for both teams with several entrances to each site.\r\nI tried to incorporate all the elements and aspects of good maps out there like Sniper spots, inhouse close quarter fighting, long streets, windows, hiding spots and the odd camping spots for the campers out there. \r\n\r\nI will be making changes to the map as im getting more used to hammer tips and tricks and will inject them into this map to get it perfect.\r\n\r\nPlease try to leave good honest feedback and advice and do not write things like THIS MAP SUCKS!! I do take critisism well and if I want to develope further as a mapper then I will read all comments and take them onboard.\r\n\r\nWell hope you take the time to download it and enjoy."
