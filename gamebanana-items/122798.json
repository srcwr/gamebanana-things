	"_sText": "My first surf map.<br>Inspired by surf_ambient made by razer and Pimp Juice<br>Halloween themed, tier 3, linear.<br>3 bonuses:<br>b1 by biji<br>b2 by Spy Complex<br>b3 by otter<br><br>sv_maxvelocity 10000<br><br>trigger_multiples for zones named according to zone type: mapstart, mapend, b1start, b1end, etc.<br><br>Bhop is allowed on anything within the main map(not any of the bonuses) that isn't triggered. You can bhop buildings, floors, spines, etc. Although, riding the spine of 2nd to last ramp is prohibited because it gives heavy headtilt. I added blockers but im sure someone will manage to avoid them anyway."
