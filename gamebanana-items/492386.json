If I could be honest, I'm disappointed with this map, it had a lot of promise, but due to my misuse of the func_areaportal I completely broke it beyond repair, at least I think I did, can't figure out how to fix it.<br><br>Sorry about the brief tangent there, it's just that I'm kinda mad at myself, I'm the only one to blame here for the map not working."
