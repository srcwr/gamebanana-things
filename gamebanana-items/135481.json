	"_sText": "\r\nThis is a second version of my olde fy_killhouse map. I've improved lighting and light maps, added more physics props, improved general layout, added railing to upper floor platforms/bridges, and have done a few other tweaks.\r\n\r\nfy_killhouse and fy_killhouse_2 are based on Killhouse B from MGS3: Subsistence's online multiplayer mode. I take inspiration from the Metal Gear series, Kojima Productions, and Konami. This map is takes 26 players max, take that into account before hosting a game. Please, put this on your server/download the map! \r\n\r\nThis is a gg version of fy_killhouse_2, as requested.  I've taken out some physics props that would be really annoying with 26 people.  There are no starting weapons, and there is room for 26 players.  Still, this is a small close quarters map."
