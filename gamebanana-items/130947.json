Thanks to gandalf for the testing and working with the map.\r\n\r\nthis map is just based on top of my head planning and going. It took me at least 5 months to complete the map. It's quite long, and suitable for about 45 players or more. Difficult areas in some of the map. I included custom songs and a secret weapon. This will not be my last map, i will continue to work with zombie escape maps. If you have any problems or glitches with the map please notify me. Steam: Token\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this map and continue to play it. Have fun!\r\n\r\nThanks again to the bG Community and Gandalf, couldn't have done it without you. :)"
