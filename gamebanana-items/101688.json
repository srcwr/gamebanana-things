Consequently, the map has been released independently here as an alternative for public and competitive style play.\r\n\r\nclose to midrange combat inside a warehouse facility. This map was under consideration for use by CAL and CPL in their gaming seasons. Original map by n@rby, based on a concept by Frank Nuccio\r\n"
