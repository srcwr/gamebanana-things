	"_sText": "This is version 2 of mg_speed, it is easier to make the jump and has 2 ramps to surf on, on each side and 3 teleporters. Awp is added (Only pros can kill with it....and bots, they own in this once they manage to pick the knife up. You also have to add the bot and load the .nav yourself.)\r\n\r\nThis version is like I said, easier for the people who thought V1 was too hard. (v1 = pro)\r\n\r\nThis map requires SKILL, people on their first try, pick up the knife and fall off first jump.\r\n\r\nAs i said before, this map is fast paced and when you pick up the knife infront of where you spawn, you get pushed with epic speed.\r\n\r\nAIM HIGHER TO GO HIGHER\r\n\r\nAIM LOWER TO GO LOWER, don't aim down unless your pro, other wise you will get owned by the ground! >:O\r\n\r\nMusic: Flying Fenix by Lit Fuse Films\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI have made the push blocks that you get pushed by, smaller, so other players do not get pushed away when proceeding to knife for the kill."
