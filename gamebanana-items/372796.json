Decided to quickly add an end to it. <br><br>~20 seconds; somewhat easy, some jumps and corners can be difficult for new players.<br><br>The map's atmosphere was supposed to have an anxiety-type dystopia feel to it. There was a lot more I wanted to do with it, but I couldn't find a good way to do things. I kind of hit a mappers block with this one; regardless, hope you guys like it for what it is. <br>"
