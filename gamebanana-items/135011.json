	"_sText": "Rusty Metal Death (RMDeath) takes many aspects of classic Gun Game maps\r\n and combines them into one small scale action packed map.  Set outdoors\r\n in the city, this map has a dirty bunker feel with red and white lights\r\n illuminating the map as well as a skybox.\r\n\r\nThis map is filled with extra hiding & sniping spots, and has those “perfect” angles that skilled players can appreciate.  Players can jump from almost every ledge and scale to the top of the middle bunker using various routes.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this map!\r\n"
