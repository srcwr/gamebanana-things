So here it is, issues I'm aware of: no but zone behind T tower @ 2 spawn points, the water outside the gate seems to not render on alot of computers, idk but they're there to stay unless someone knows how I can reverse engineer it.\r\n\r\nTry to find the light switches at CT spawn( shoot them ) and enjoy the flashlight mayhem.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nCreated by Dan B ( √êanx64, Clarissa )\r\nand Jake S ( Silenced )\r\n\r\nfeel free to add the creator's steam ( danx64 ) and tell me what you think about the map on steam or here!\r\n\r\n<h1>IMPORTANT NOTE:</h1> We desperatly need hosts to put the map up so we can see how it works with humans in it, lol. Please contact me on steam( danx64 ), through this site or via email( danx64@gmail.com ) if you plan to host this map, even just once for me ;]"
