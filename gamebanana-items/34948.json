There should be approximately 30-35 of them, some are once again a bit contrived (\"Stairwell\" just being a ramp and \"Crawlspace\" and \"Tunnel\" for two of the four separated walkways on the lower bridge are probably the worst 3, but I thought it's better to let them have different names even if they don't 100% fit than the same everywhere).<br>"
