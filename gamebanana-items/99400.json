I'd like to hear any criticism that you may be able to provide. Thanks for checking it out and I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n*Update*1.1 So I've added the garage that I mentioned in the video, changed a few textures, cleaned up some lines in the house, and moved the trees around a bit. Expect the front gate, driveway, and depending on how it looks a fountain in the next few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rvwQYvFznT8&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rvwQYvFznT8&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"
