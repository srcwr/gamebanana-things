The finished iteration of my map bhop_Zelda. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThank you everyone for your support!\r\n<br><br>\r\nI started this map around two years ago, never got to finishing it until now.\r\nSince then it's beta has been leaked and I lost motivation to finish.\r\nBut after a while I realized that I shouldn't let that stop me.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIs this map worth replacing the beta on your server?\r\nWhile the length of the map is pretty much the same it features bug fixes, soundscapes, an end room, a bonus, and extra, completed content that adds to the quality and enjoy-ability of the map.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt's not perfect, but this is the completed vision I had for bhop_Zelda.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI decided not to use NES Zelda songs for the soundscapes.\r\nI felt that the original NES songs are slightly annoying for a looped soundscape; so I used songs from Twilight Princess, Majora's Mask, A Link Between Worlds, and The Wind Waker.  I found that they are more pleasant to listen to for 5-10 minutes as you play the stages.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe bonus is decently challenging, but very long. It will be hard to speedrun, but I wanted something that felt rewarding to complete. Good luck getting good times on it!\r\n<br><br>\r\nSpecial thanks to Guadalupe, my mentor, motivator, and inspiration. I've learned a lot from you and I appreciate all the time you give me.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd also bhop_Alex. For annoying me over and over to finish bhop_Zelda. Seriously, this completed version of bhop_Zelda may have never happened if you had not shown me so much support. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThanks to everyone who downloads, plays, supports, and hates my map.\r\nI love to create for the bhop community and I love you all.</font><font size=\"4\"><br></font><br>Most textures I made myself.Some sounds were taking from the actual Zelda games.<br>Lost Woods Dubstep - Ephixa<br>Some Zelda related images I found on google.<br><br><font size=\"4\">Ps.
