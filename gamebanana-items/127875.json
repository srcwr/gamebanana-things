	"_sText": "- Improved - Made the flag come up with it ( sorry for the pink and black )\r\n- Better healing zone\r\n- More columns\r\n\r\nThis map will hopefully bring the new cstrike category, capture the flag.\r\nThanks to Saitek for modification of the flag and making it transparent.\r\n\r\nIn this map you will have to break the wall and then run to get the flag and carry it to opposition`s base and then drop it in the cube.\r\nYou have to do it 2 times to get teleported to winning/loosing room where you have few weapons and execution for the loosers.\r\n\r\nMap Features\r\n- Realistic Snow\r\n- Dustmotes ( just to make it more sexy ?)\r\n- 3D Skybox, made it look like WoW buildings cus the flag will fit with it.\r\n- Regenaration area (covers the flag area) to stop getting owned by the usp person, well i cant stop them killing you cus every weapon can kill you if its fired in the right speed.\r\n- Usp=Flag Stripper, kinda cant figure out how to delete the gun.\r\n- Execution and weapons in the end.\r\n- Quake 3 like boosters ( thats where i got the idea from at the first place)\r\n- Decals instructing a new player how to play this\r\n- If the physics/gravity is broken and the guns fall out the map and hits the trigger it will respawn in 5 secs."
