If you're one of those 24/7 Iceworld kind of guys/gals you'll have some good fun with this map.\r\n\r\nIt's nothing spectacular in the way of graphics or anything, but the gameplay is fun.  There may be some issues here and there, but nothing that would ruin the fun that I'm aware of.  We ran it on a no camping server, and it was a blast.  I'm sure some will love it, and others will hate it. Works for me. :)\r\n\r\nCopyright notice?  You're kidding right?  Have at it if you want to do anything with it... it could be easily re-created by most of the mappers here anyway.\r\n\r\nHaven't mapped in years so don't expect any edits or updates, just sharing the fun.\r\n\r\nThis map is in rotation on the Custom Kill Zone Alpha Server  (server  ip - 8.12.71.21:27015 )"
