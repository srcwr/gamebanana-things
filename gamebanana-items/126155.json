	"_sText": "So...\r\n\r\nIve been a huge fan of map creators and their amazing work. Ive always felt that map makers create things with quality i would never be able to come up against. Well, ive now made a map of my own. I wouldn't say its awesome, but, in my opinion, its playable. It has 5 sections which can be done quickly if you find the best route to take. It also has a drop-down and a ladderjump.\r\n\r\nI failed hard on lighting, but it doesn't effect the gameplay in any way, the only thing i want is you completing and playing my map as fast as you possibly can - it would mean so much to me! <3\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy my map! - FuZzi // WyFly"
