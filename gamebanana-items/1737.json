This is my first crack at it and will release other versions in the future. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the side fence door is not operational. Also note that I placed a random door next to the stove to show there the backdoor of the house can be located. I placed it there to be used as a suggestion.\r\n\r\nAlso do not feel limited to the light I have chosen. If you want a day time environment then change the light_environment and delete the lights I have placed. \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: If you plan to add this to one of your maps then please give credit where credit is due."
