	"_sText": "de_bustpoo is a map that was made in the span of a weekend by me. don't let the stupid name and dev textures fool you, it's a serious map. and though it's probably not near perfect, I found it fun during the little testing I did. It supports long-range and close-range encounters, and there are lots of different positions that you can experiment with.<br><br>the map is split between two floor levels, with bombsite A and B placed on top of each other. CTs start fairly close to both bombsites, and can rotate between them easily. Ts have access to a garage door that opens up another route to bombsite B, a door that only terrorists can open when they are ready."
