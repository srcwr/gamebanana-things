	"_sText": "This is a remake of de_dolls, a rats styled map. The errors were removed (if you're familiar with the original you know what I mean), some very minor tweaking was done, but mostly this is a retexture. I completely remade the pillow on the bed, added some necessary player clip brushes (although invisible they help you not get caught on corners, etc.) and even added a popcorn container. :) All the new textures are custom made & colored by me (though I didn't necessarily create the image files from scratch on all of them, obviously). Good for regular or WCS mod."
