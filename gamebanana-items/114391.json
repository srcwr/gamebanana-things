Have fun playing this map and remember to leave some feedback on the INS Mod forum in the topic which I have made. You can also post feedback on the steam forums,  URLs is below.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.insmod.net/index.php?showtopic=3946\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=6345149#post6345149\r\n\r\nThis map supports up to 16 players, 8 on each side. This is the first beta of the map, much of this could change, while it could change a little. More screenshots will be posted soon.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add the map to your servers."
