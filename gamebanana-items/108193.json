I'll try adding a navagation file and add info_nodes soon, and hopefully bot play will be better.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n============\r\nJust decided to try to make this in CS:S as my first real map for the source engine, watching my friends play Black Ops. I don't own BLOPS, so i used google images and youtube for reference.     \r\n\r\nI know it could be a lot better and many issues, including the quality/presentation of the carepackages, custom textures, better/origininal models by me, etc, will be improved in the final version.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look!       \r\n= )\r\n    \r\n    \r\nNOTE\r\n====\r\nI'm willing to make ANY changes to the map if you'd like to throw it on a server. I HAVE NOT had much opportunity to test so i know there are many bug/issues i probably don't even know about!\r\n\r\n   \r\nBug reports and anything else, contact:\r\n=======================================\r\nSteam: captain0terror@gmail.com   \r\ngmail: captain0terror@gmail.com   \r\nMSN: captain0terror@hotmail.com   \r\n     \r\n      \r\nLinks\r\n=====\r\n[Full README](http://localhostr.com/file/3czLJad/nuketown%20README_.txt)(Best viewed in Notepad!)\r\n\r\nMore images, information, and the HL2DM port(EXACTLY the same as the CS:S version, except it has DM and TDM spawns, and deathmatch weapons), [Visit Here](http://twhl.info/vault.php?map=5640)."
