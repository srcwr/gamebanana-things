	"_sText": "A map based off of Socom's very own Frostfire\r\nThis a pretty close representation of the map.\r\nIt is however not meant to be an exact copy, as I've made changes to flesh it out more and make it more gun game friendly.\r\nBut all in all it seems to be one of the closes to the original on this site. \r\nBut If you loved Socom then I think you'll enjoy this.\r\nAs most seem to prefer maps that are small,action packed,and fast, this map is getting mixed reviews on my server but seems to be generally liked.\r\nI would say it a medium sized map, rounds are not super fast but also don't take forever.\r\nTo that end please comment good or bad and possible changes.\r\nIf you want to post negative things about the map, go ahead I can take it.\r\nBut If your just going to say it sucks, that's fine, but at least try and have a reason or a suggestion to improve.\r\nOne thing I hear sometimes is to add the lower level. I thought about and decided that it would make the level to big for gun game.\r\nI might add them in the future and add this map to a reg CS:S map if it's well liked \r\nthanks!"
