EVAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts fast, hectic.. its got one hell of a lot of bombs..\r\n\r\nits pitchblack!!\r\n\r\ndo you go in guns-a-blazing, torch on? or do you try the sneaky aproach, and hunt down your prey silently before knifing them in the back?\r\n\r\nwith de_pitchblack, the choice is yours.\r\n\r\nit also has curvy pillars.\r\n\r\nN.B.: \r\n> there are 24 spawn points, but it gets a little insane when theres more than 8 =D\r\n\r\n> the bombsite is located in the middle, underneath the pulsating spotlight. Every terrorist starts with a bomb.\r\n\r\n> ALLOW FLASHLIGHTS FOR THIS MAP xD\r\n\r\n> the walls between the pillars are breakable, with 100hp. Use this to your advantage, and surprise enemies\r\n\r\nOh, and BTW, big shout out to m3h, who introduced me to hammer and helped me work on this map originally\r\n\r\nGOOD LUCK, SOLDIER"
