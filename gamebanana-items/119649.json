Now here is a message to all mappers, this map is freely yours. I allow any modifications to this map and i dont mind if you resubmit it as a v2 or whatever. all i ask is that you credit me, thats it. I started to rush when i saw i was nearly finished so it mah look a bit bleh sometimes. Thats when you come in...</font>\r\n\r\nHave fun and get some frags!"
