	"_sText": "After remaking ice world with HD effects, I felt like making a warm green map. Using concept of arena maps for gun game I built this smooth flowing map that is fun for people who love to knife or use small arms. There are also a few straight-away's to make sure sniper rifles are useful too.\r\n\r\nThis map is specifically balanced to provide the greatest advantage to people with medium arms, and to make no position great to sit and camp - forcing the players to keep moving to stay alive."
