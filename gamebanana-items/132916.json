	"_sText": "1 week after the nuclear bombing of Racoon City the Umbrella Corporation sends another special force into the hive to find the antidote against the T-Virus. But the zombies down there are still alive and hungry...\r\n\r\nHere's my next zm-map after zm_piranesi and zm_Fidlers-Green. The story is centered around the underground labor called the hive of the Resident Evil movie. It contains the trainyard, the labs, the laserroom, the office and some warehouses. \r\n\r\nThere are some scripted events and alot of shock moments build in. Also some weird stuff was going on down there beside the T-Virus, so give it a shot and enjoy the show :)\r\n\r\nps: still looking for a server to test my maps ;) add Euerfeldi in steam for infos"
