This is infact my second design based on that map and this is the one i feel best portrays my work. The original map always brought a problem on the servers because the Spawns we're raised and there was no way to get back into them once you'd left. Spawn Campers had a pretty easy time picking people off at the back and other players could only attack directly in their line of sight. To combat this i've altered the height and added a staircase to the side. Using the custom dev textures as well the curving techniques i use, i'm proud of the outcome and hope others enjoy playing on it.\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528. Thanks for the textures.\r\nBased on kk_arena.\r\n\r\nCustom Textures added with Pakrat.\r\n\r\nSpawn Points: 36"
