If you do need more however, I am sure I can fit more in. :P\r\n\r\nIt was a hassle to make but it turned out partially well :D\r\n\r\n\r\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\r\nAuthor's Readme\r\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\r\n\r\n-This map is extremely small\r\n-Visit http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/153530 for my profile and to see more of my maps\r\n-Feel free to reproduce my map on other sites but make a note that I made it, -RemiX-.\r\n-Notes: The teleport gates at each spawn are kinda buggy.  I will try to fix it but I have already tried with an unsuccessful attempt :(.  All the guns in the map already have ammo.  You start with some duelies and can pick up a m4, ak, shotty, autoshotty, p90, tmp, uzi, scout, and nades.  No buyzones.  If you want a gungame version of my map with no weapons on the ground, visit: <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/35322\">gg_rem!x_4lvl</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: lime; text-align: center; font-size: xx-large;\">PLEASE ASSESS!!</p>"
