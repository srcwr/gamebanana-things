	"_sText": "I thought a park would look good with Italy themed textures. Originally the map was going to take place at night, with the street lights to light the map. But I figured day time is much better for Gun Game. \r\n\r\nThis is the second map I've ever made, but this was the first time I have used real textures (first map was developers texture).\r\n\r\nIf you see the underside of the map from spectator, you will notice about 40 light poles coming out of the bottom. I wanted to use the top half of the light poles as the end posts for my flower boxes and what not. I have no idea if you can even cut a prop or scale and size down. So my solution was to just have them come out of the bottom. Don't worry, they cause no errors, and are do not effect game play what so ever though :D Enjoy."
