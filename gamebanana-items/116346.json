(http://steamcommunity.com/id/neox77/). I used two prefab, one for the big three with the hut and one for the helipad which are above the house, otherwise all of the map was created by me.I named the map \"fkcinghouse\" because I don't like my map :/ And it's very boring to retexture that é_è.Bsp size : ~20 Mo<br><br>"
