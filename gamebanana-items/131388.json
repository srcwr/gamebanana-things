	"_sText": "<b>Of course</b> you know boatescape, which originally wasn't made by me but by JJ45\r\nIf not: It's the goal to reach a chopper that brings you away from the zombies that will be blown up by a nuke after it took off.\r\n\r\n<b>And of course</b> you know that <i>people are always falling off the chopper, so i fixed that.. (hope it works)</i> and this is the only thing i changed, for any further changes could destroy the well-liked gameplay or reduce the FPS (i played 3_sn or so and it lagged on a big server...) Even adding light greatly reduces the FPS :/\r\n\r\nMainly fixed for Vampy's and Snipez's great zombie mod server!\r\nHf, 50ae"
