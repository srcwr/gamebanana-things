Always loved to play both maps gg_aim_shotty and gg_aim_shotty_ac, but when server was full, those maps were just 2 small. So I decided to do version2 in which are 2 floors. Enaugh space for 32 players now. Added many details aswell, version 1 didnt had. This version is full detailed and great to play, like those 2 maps before\r\n"
