	"_sText": "Ok, this map is based on the smash maps that are floating around on FPSbanana, more specifically the ones with cannons.\r\n\r\nThis map involves a team of 4 terrorists who try to prevent the counter-terrorists from making it across the map(an arsenal of AWPs awaits the CTs). There are a total of 8 turrets on the map that the terrorists can use. Once the CTs make it past a certain point, a teleporter will open up and allow the terrorists to advance to a second turret as a final defense.\r\n\r\nThe map features:\r\n\r\n- 76 Fully breakable platforms that allow the CTs various paths to the end.\r\n- 4 \"safe houses\" that are much harder to knock off(the base does not break or move)\r\n- all platforms are respawnable.(respawn times vary based on the size of the plaform)\r\n- random path remover system that will remove some paths to vary the gameplay at start.\r\n- an AFK system(kills the afkers)\r\n- 3 included songs for optional playback. (Xenogenocide - Black Hole Earth Consumption, DJ TiÃ«sto - Personal Reflexion, and Waterflame - -Control: Crowd- )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap Requires mp_limitteams 0 server setting.\r\nPlayer Slots: 36 (4 terrorist and 32 Counter-terrorists)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
