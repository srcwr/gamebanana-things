My goal was to give people the feel for speed as these marbles go careening down the track!\r\n\r\n-Features custom sounds from the game. However, the song from the vid is not included in the map.\r\n\r\n-This map is chaos driven, thus it doesnt always work out perfect, but its still fun when it doesnt! :D\r\n\r\n-The first ball is to represent sonic while the second tails.\r\n\r\n-I had a lot of fun making this, I hope you have fun viewing it. I hit max_map_planes and almost max_map_overlays. lol. There are suppose to be a lots more curves in those ramps as well as more rings/brushwork but I had to cut back in order to compile.\r\n\r\n-This map was compiled in HDR, if you dont like hdr you can turn it off with mat_hdr_enabled 0\r\n \r\n\r\nRunning instructions: \r\nMade this in the cs:s game environment. It includes a spawn spot for T if you prefer to noclip rather than spectate. I suggest reloading the map each time you want to restart the marbles, otherwise things parented to the marbles will not be reset, however it is not a huge issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nvid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR_tOU5fvu4\r\n\r\n<object width=\"256\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OR_tOU5fvu4&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OR_tOU5fvu4&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"256\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"
