I was wondering if we/you could replace the music though, from the resident evil music to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UJA3OX7frs , In the first version of this map I had it to trigger this sound when the button to call train was pressed. But then I had to make so many fixes to the map I took it out becase I didn't want to add another 40meg to the download of the map.\r\n\r\n>What do you think?\r\n\r\n>Prof. Yaffle"
