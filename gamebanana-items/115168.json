	"_sText": "Hey yall!  This is my second map, as promised I added on to the map, buy putting in 2 sniping towers (1 on both the ct, and t side), added stairs on each side of the center barrier, added support for more players (was going to add support for 32 players, but the map would be way too cluttered with that many ppl). and even added in HDR!  My first time delving into HDR, from now on, all my maps will probably be HDR as well.  Please leave some comments, the more feed back I get the better my maps get :D\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/\">\r\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n<br />This work is licensed under a \r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License</a>."
