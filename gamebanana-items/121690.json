	"_sText": "This would be my first surf style map made simply because my clanmate told me to. Personally I felt the map is relatively easy to complete, but upon putting it on our server (8.3.6.35:27015), people were struggling to a degree. The lighting on the map is interesting and my warp tubes are pretty crazy. A helpful hint about the first tunnels: I find that if you get in there with some speed, simply holding W works to get you through. Another thing to note is that after you are shot upwards, make sure you turn around completely for that is where the map continues; that way and to the left in a bit. Enjoy the map!"
