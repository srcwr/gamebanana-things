	"_sText": "The maker of this map is me, Guod/Doug (I don't know what I call myself these days). I got advice on various gameplay aspects from BlackFigment, so I named the map after him.\r\n\r\nMy idea for this map was two gg maps in one. The result is two simple gg levels stacked with ramps and such. Interestingly, BOTs usually go lower and real players usually go upper. The map has 72 spawns (36 for each team).\r\n\r\nOriginally intended for gungame, but turned out a bit too big for smaller gungame servers. It works quite well on larger GG/DM servers."
