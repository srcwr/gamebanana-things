	"_sText": "Objective:\r\n\r\nBoth teams spawn in a buyzone and then drop down into the maze, they have to try and find + kill the enemy team which can be hard because its hard to find them, its almost imposable to camp because all routes eventually link up and you never know when someone is behind you. there is alot of climbing and falling in this map so be careful you dont fall xD.\r\n\r\nBoth spawn have trigger_push's to push afk people out of spawn and all textures that are used are custom.\r\n\r\nIt has 32 T spawns are 32 Ct spawns\r\n\r\nThanks, Duffy :D\r\n\r\nPlease rate and comment but only comment if your going to be creative."
