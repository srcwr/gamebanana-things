Baracade yourself whereever you so choose, but beware, zombies could have the upper hand on this map if you don't watch your back... \r\nThe maps has an underground area which can be accessed from the ground level.  More rooms need to be added in the underground, which I'll get to soon.  Another, smaller, underground passageway can get you from one end of the map to the other... its worth taking this route if a zombie is making its way through your barade because it just might get you to safety... but be weary, you could end up trapped.\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble working the ambient sounds. For some reason they just don't want to toggle on the first map spawn.  I'll get it figured out for the Final.\r\n\r\nPlease test my map out and tell me what you guys think.  It IS my first map as stated before, so I'm not expecting everyone to like it.  Suggestions help alot, so toss em to me.  Also if you find any glitches, let me know. Thanks! \r\n\r\n"
