I was working on two very good maps which where almost finished but I lost both of them to blue screen :(\r\n\r\nSo in my anger I made this to demonstrate how crap the standard of maps can be on this site. Ah well\r\n\r\nOk so this was based on the crossroads map from the game Crossfire (which is one of those really gay free online shooters that is infested with 6 year olds). I made a nav file for the bots aswell but they are pretty stupid on it though.\r\n\r\nENJOY!\r\n\r\nOk well seems as noone likes my work I'm quitting mapping for CS:S I may even quit FPSB all together if it hates all my work this much."
