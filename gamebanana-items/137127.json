It's an GunGame map, specialy to DeathMatch tipe of GunGame.\r\nIt has a large amount of spots and different climbing ways to the tower.\r\nI was able to provide a spot in the starting zone to snipers kill other snipers in the other side. The tower is quite big, and will serve to test the capability of the team to conquer it and hold it. The tower offers a great visibility to the way the other team comes, but it has the disadvantage that it's prefurable, so people down in the floor can kill others in the tower without they even see who attacked.\r\n\r\nPersonaly, I thing that the map came out better than I expected, and I hope everyone enjoy it!\r\n\r\n\r\n[NEW VERSION - CLICK HERE!](http://www.gamebanana.com/cssgg/maps/165489 \"New version - CLICK HERE!\")"
