	"_sText": "Just updated the map to v6.\r\n\r\nv6 fixes up some bugs with v5.  I'm working on the next release which will focus entirely and the look and feel of the map.  This means it will come with lighting, more custom texturing, more detailing, and overall size improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\nModerate overhaul of electric_edited_v2.  I removed/redirected the teleports that originally went to armory.  I also created a load of new secrets for CT's to help balance out that change.  One of the biggest spots is the corridor, which provides an excellent sniping point if you can figure out how to get in there.  There are actually two ways to do it.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n- Pool has overlook\r\n- Replaced ugly textures with less-ugly textures\r\n- Shower secret now accessible by just one player\r\n- CT overlook is now glass wall instead of one-way invisible wall\r\n- Pool is smaller\r\n- VIP cell has hidden exit to lockers\r\n- Soccer has two ladders to top instead of one\r\n- Several other secrets\r\n\r\nI apologize that I still haven't gotten to the lighting issue.  I'm working on fixing that in future releases."
