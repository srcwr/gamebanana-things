Someone in his school doesn't like him and decides to destroy his antfarm. Hearing this news vivi rushes to get his friends AND PROTECT WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY HIS!!. \r\n- this epic battle takes place in two settings 1. the antfarm - you start in the ant farm and work your way out to grow to normal size. 2. the Lab - you play as a big peron here and the ant farms are located on the tables.\r\n\r\n----- why I made the map-----\r\n\r\nI made this map for 1.6 and i decided to bring it back with a lil spice. Once i finished this map i realized i want to make a map pack of small to big maps. I have already made De_sony-psp and im going to make another. (hint fish bowl hint) so enjoy my map everyone i spent a good deal working on the textures and the floor tiles are custom. remodled after my schools. \r\n\r\n-----Special thanks--------\r\n\r\nEveryone who beta tested and nba1314 for sugesting another bombsite.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!!!!\r\n\r\n--Other maps made by Generalvivi--\r\nawp_subzero\r\nfy_caution-tape\r\nDe_sony-psp\r\n**soon** de_graveyard\r\n**soon** awp_subzero-real\r\n\r\n---- OTHER NOTES------"
