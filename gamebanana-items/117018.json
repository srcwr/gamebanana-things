	"_sText": "This map is in development and will any moment be finished.\r\nI released .VMF below which you can use to edit the map or compile it... you will have to add proper spawnpoints. The map works great with bots!\r\n\r\nThis map can be either long range or CQB.... If you choose to stay in buildings you will have CQB. If you stay outside you would rather be carrying long range guns. This map will maybe become a Demolition map! This map also requires teamwork if you don't want to become overrun!\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\nMore advanced lightning is being added\r\nEnhancement of environment (market being built, props in buildings etc... )\r\nFixing some textures :)\r\n\r\nWhich might be considered as bug:\r\nGetting on roofs by jumping on walllights...\r\n> this was possible in SOCOM too (but on another method...\r\n\r\nThe map is somehow rdy to be played, but you will not notice any enerving bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the most played map on a FPS game named SOCOM 2 US Navy SEALs\r\njust google for it\r\n\r\nnow i need comments or suggestions what to add or edit"
