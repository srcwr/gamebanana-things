Try and see it as an extreamly easy way to get exemplary feedback xD.\r\n\r\n~Enjoy!<center>\r\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/responders/addtofavs?section=maps&itemid=117011\">Fav this map!</a>\r\n<a href= \"http://www.fpsbanana.com/responders/addtowl?key=pKN15fJ66PTpduqOViPJD91wWpkKsplv/jvm&section=users&itemid=699321\">Watch me as a submitter :)</a></h1></center>"
