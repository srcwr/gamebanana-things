As you \r\ntravel down the track make sure to keep\r\naway from the third rail and oncoming trains.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: The Terrorist carrying the\r\nC4 must place the bomb at one of the two\r\nbomb sites at the end of the tunnel.\r\nAs with the CT's watch that third rail \r\nand oncoming trains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first map.  I used it as a means to learn\r\nHammer and get ready for the release of DoD:S\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nUnrar this file in your counter-strike source/cstrike/maps directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangeLOG:\r\n\r\nVer 2  12/14/04\r\n1.  Geometry added to Train path to help prevent sound leak and problems with the source engine.  (Possible BUG)\r\n2.  Bomb zones enlarged to make it easier for the T's to plant\r\n3.  Made T spawn less crowded to make getting out easier.\r\n4.  Addition of a duct to facilitate passage from one upper platform to another.\r\n5.  Additional exit for CT's\r\n6.  Added wall to T's spawn exit to help balance game.\r\n"
