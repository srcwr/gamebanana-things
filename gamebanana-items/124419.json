	"_sText": "Been a while since i made a glow map and i had this lying around so i thought id finish it, its similar to <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/199359\">bhop_purpleglow</a>&nbsp;in terms of size and length, however it has some different obstacles than my previous maps so i hope that will be interesting. Not really much to say, all should be pos on scroll if u like playing that but id recommend to play it on auto since it will flow better.&nbsp; I believe the map should be around 1 minute and 30 seconds long.<br><br>Huge thanks to Asko and Mad for testing the map multiple times and Promises for letting me test the map on his server."
