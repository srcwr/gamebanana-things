Amazing features and a great atmosphere outside.\"\r\n- \"A stunning map to play on. So much fun. LASER FTW!!!\"\r\n\r\n========================================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe first map I ever made. It was done in 6 weeks from start to finish, with no previous mapping experience. This was exclusively made for a server known as Xtreme Jailbreak, which I teched at the time. Since then, I have left this server, so I'm releasing this map publicly. The map itself is stable even when running on servers taking 50+ players. If anyone experiences any issues with Xtreme Servers saying the map is theirs and theirs alone, you have my permission as the mapper to use this wherever and however you like. They do not own my material.\r\n\r\n========================================================================================================\r\n\r\nThis map although lacking in detail, came to be one of the most enjoyed maps on the server, and is still used to this day, along with many other servers who have stolen it. This release is the official one used on the server and so it includes all the custom banners. \r\n\r\n========================================================================================================\r\n\r\nIt features:\r\n\r\n- Large capacity cell area\r\n- Two floored armory\r\n- Big cage/Tables/Yellow line for control areas\r\n- Kitchen with raising/closing window\r\n- Security Red Room for transport\r\n- Waterpolo\r\n- Diving\r\n- Healing showers\r\n- Tic Tac Toe\r\n- Basketball\r\n- Park\r\n- Theatre\r\n- Obstacle Course\r\n- Castlewars\r\n- Interactive race track\r\n- Control Towers\r\n- Closed gun shop (accessable via exploding car)\r\n- Garage with breakable power box\r\n- Secret weapon via passcoded door\r\n- Disco cell\r\n- Security Sensor Light\r\n- Dodgeball\r\n- Moving spotlights\r\n- Realistic Street environment\r\n- Animated Skybox\r\n- Dual vent system\r\n- Random cell weapon spawner\r\n- Hidden weapons in cells\r\n- Medic & Solitary\r\n- And more.\r\n\r\n========================================================================================================\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this map is packed full of activies and features, and is easily playable and controlable. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it, and make sure you comment on what you think of it.
