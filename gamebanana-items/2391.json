Again I have used an existing building as a reference for my moedlling,the real house can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/qhohqm\r\n\r\nThe house is probably Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe house is optimized with nodraw textures and areaportals. People have asked me before why I'm not providing interiors and lightning with my prefabs and my honest answer is that both lightning and interiors (also the textures) is a huge part of the ambience of a map/building, therefor I put that responsible in your hand. It's better to add after your taste, rather than start out by deleting lots of props and lightning that you don't like.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the prefab to whatever you like, however, please let me know if you use the prefab in an official release, it would make me happy :D"
