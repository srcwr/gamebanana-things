	"_sText": "This is a city gungame map with a space theme. It's symmetrical with teams spawning in the corners. It has 5 buildings with 3 of them having 4 levels, but they aren't insanely big and all points on the map have multiple access points making it hard for a constant camper to take much advantage. There are a few outside ladders and slopped surfaces to allow players to go from higher levels to lower levels quickly.  \r\n\r\nThanks to Quinity for his space skybox and [-B-] for his halo textures. NOTE: I can't find the author of the other textures I used. So if anyone recognizes them PLEASE send me a pm or post so I can give proper credit. EDIT: found.\r\n\r\nIf you upload this map to your server or use it as inspiration for your own map, please post here or pm me.\r\n"
