I hope everyone has enjoyed my previous maps.\r\n\r\nThis is a beta version, there are a few things that sometimes don't work and I can't figure out why(sometimes fall dmg doesn't work but it works for others/ When people throw nades it echos throughout the whole map(disable this by using \"sv_ignoregrenaderadio 1\")). . But the whole course is completable and finished.\r\n\r\nYou don't die in this map, so no restarting at the beginning. \r\n\r\nMap is complete with -\r\nObstacles\r\nClimbing\r\nSliderace\r\nLaunch Ramps\r\nAnd much more!\r\n\r\n*(may need to turn your sound up on level 11)\r\n\r\nRemember to add these commands to console\r\n(\"sv_ airaccelerate 100\")\r\n(\"sv_ ignoregrenaderadio 1\")\r\n\r\nAny feedback or bugs reported will be appreciated. Enjoy.\r\n\r\n[Download Now! - mg_ g2_ course](http://adf.ly/2KFdQ)\r\n\r\nRecommended on a NoBlock server -Come play on ours! -Gamers Guild Original Maps Server![NoBlock|Bhop|FastDL] 66.151.244.188:27015"
