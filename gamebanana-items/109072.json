I didn't bother releasing any pre-releases because thats useless.\r\n\r\nBUGS: If theres any bugs, I didn't find them in my hours of testing. This is a very complete version. If you find anything wrong with it tell me and i'll fix it.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: You'll need to let it calculate the bot NAV first time you run with bots. After that it'll be fine. Enjoy!"
