	"_sText": "This is a little improvement from my last map, cs_assault_gadget. It's supposed to run smoother, and there are some other visual improvements. The idea of this map is to keep the style true to the original cs_assault. Some might think that I should have used more of what Source can offer, but I didn't bother with this map. That would have changed the gameplay of the map."
