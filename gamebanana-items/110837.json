Launch the grenades over the wall, indicated by the arrows,\r\nto reach the other side and to touch the opposing team\r\n\r\nThe two teams reach on the second floor by stairs \r\n\r\nThe second stage, it is the same thing, but you can break the panes.\r\nThis second stage is directed to 90 degrees of the first.\r\n\r\nThere are four holes, with the four corners of the map where pillars are\r\n\r\nAs the second stage is to 90 degree compared to the first,\r\ntake care to not launch your grenades on your teammates :) \r\n\r\n3) INFORMATIONS\r\n\r\nthe screenshots which I took are for the halflife2.filefront.com website with\r\nan aim of bringing the most descriptions to you for my map \r\n\r\nAuthor : PLAN \"p@f\" Ju\r\nMSN : ju.plan@free.fr for any suggestion\r\n\r\nThank to my bro for his ideas and for testing, thanks to halflife2.filefront.com to host my map,\r\nthank to Angel : AOJ\r\n\r\n(FR)Shinra Corp.inc 2005 \r\n\r\nps: I'm sorry to degrade at this point the English language"
