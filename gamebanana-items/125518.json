	"_sText": "So theres not much changed in this map, but i made this version from one reason.. I think its the best map i've made, but way underplayed... \r\n\r\nSo i figured out that, if you play the lvls individually, like normal bhop maps, where you have to beat the first lvl to get to the second..\r\n\r\nThis map has that now, you do it one by one... Which means you can run it with a counter aswell.. \r\n\r\nI hope this will give you guys more use of my map :) \r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
