	"_sText": "It is a bit dark but I wanted it to be like a digital labyrinth.  I may have the surf split off into 2 sections so that people can enjoy it a bit more.  That is accualy an optomized version using func detail where I could. . . I believe it is the tons of lighting I used that makes the map file size so huge, but FPS was great for me, which means average for most.\r\n\r\n\r\n!!! This map was made for a 66 tic server. . . When running counterstrike add to launch properties -tickrate 66 if you plan to host on your own.  \r\n\r\nLike I said, Final wont be out for a long ass time. . . at least untill holidays or later.  But this version is fully functioning.  "
