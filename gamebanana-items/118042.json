I did compile the cubemaps correctly so there should be no problems with that.\r\n\r\nI was inspired to create this map after playing on the map awpf_crumblecup.  I liked the quickness of the rounds but it still had some tactics involved.\r\n\r\nThe maximum player slots is 36.  I recommend playing with 10 or less players total though.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to host this map on your server, then give me the IP and I will definitely come and play on it.\r\n\r\nFeel free to decompile the map if you really need to for some reason.  Don't distribute to other sites though unless I give you the go-ahead.\r\n\r\nPlease assess and give some <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/pages/459\">Constructive Criticism</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/153530\"><img src=\"http://image.hazardstrip.com/upic/153530.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/1372\"><img src=\"http://image.hazardstrip.com/banners/studios/chaoscopy.png\"></a>"
