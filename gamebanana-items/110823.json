	"_sText": "IN A NUTSHELL... Another sub-par tennis map. Custom sky, and banner promoting a friends server, which really is a good one. What makes this map stand out from the other tennis maps?\r\n\r\n\"Tilez\". Tilez are.... tiles that when stepped on they glow. Simple, makes the map more colorful, and a bit different. Each tiles has a color it changes to when stepped on, total of 12 different colors.\r\n\r\nMap supports 24 players max, 72 nades on each side, thats 144 total plus the in a full game theres a total of 168 nades (each person spawns with 1).\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at \"tilez\" in a fun way, plus first time making a tennis map. Give it a shot if you're bored of the same old tennis maps."
