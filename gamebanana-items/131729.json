	"_sText": "Well, I don't think I released the first version, but if you go to [TAG]=>Zombie Infection server, you probably played it once or twice, depending on your timing. But this is the newest release. It is similar to lila_panic. There is an outdoor area, much bigger than lila_panics, though. And then there is a basement. The basement area was created by TheFrog, who is also registered here. He can go by either that or Darth, I believe. But anyway, the map is pretty big. Hopefully the gameplay is balanced out pretty well, and there aren't any cheap spots.\r\n\r\nHate vents? Hooray for you, this map has NO vents. Vents suck."
