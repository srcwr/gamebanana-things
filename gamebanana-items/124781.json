IP: 74.91.120.153</code>\r\n\r\nHere it is, finally. \r\n\r\nThis was designed to be a non challenging speedrun map for servers that run either <u>autohop</u>/ezhop/timer or combination of all three. That is because in this map you will come across slanted blocks, crouch hopping, this map also awards higher speeds with additional shortcut/skip possibilities.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n> _Please note that this map was made with and only autohop in mind. With that said, I highly recommend against playing on this map using your scroll wheel. You have been warned, people who go against this warning risk an extreme chance of anal bleeding, projectile vomiting, unstoppable diarrhea, death. Additionally if you decide to try and play this map using scroll wheel, then the amount of fun will drop like a ton of bricks into negative values._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is about a 5-10 minute long map (depending on your skill level) on an autohop/ezhop server. It should not be hard, since I was trying it to have a easy flooow with a small amount of parts that are higher in difficulty ranging from medium to slightly hard. \r\n\r\nWith permission and help from <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/46201\">Xenon</a>, I am happy to say that this map includes a fully functioning replica of <code>skyworld</code> with perfectly smooth model surf ramps. You can think of this as a resort where you can relax, surf around at ridiculous speeds and do tricks after you have beaten the map and might need to wait for others to finish. \r\n\r\nI would like to have you know that I had to learn to make custom particles while creating this map so they might seem basic and simple without much complexity going on. I plan on improving that in my future maps.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that I will be taking a completely different approach to my future maps. I will no longer be making the shell first in nodraw and then filling it up with detail, but fully design room by room. This will allow me to create much more detailed maps in the future, without running into compile troubles because I didn't have enough resources left to thoroughly design the detail throughout the map. I was absolutely oblivious to that thought and it dawned upon me in midst of this map.\r\n\r\nSome of the things I already know that should be improved:\r\n\r\n- FPS drop in the starting area due to poor particle optimization.\r\n- In some areas it's hard to tell where you can or can't jump.\r\n- Near the end, a trigger is slightly touching red part of slanted platform.\r\n- Work on particle optimization.\r\n- Boosters might not boost you as high rarely. <font size=\"small\"><i>Can be fixed via EntSpy or Stripper.</i></font>\r\n\r\n- Random shaking in short sequences some times. <br>\r\nServer owners can fix this by using Stripper: Source and creating a <code>bhop\\_cw\\_journey.cfg</code> file in your <code>addons/stripper/maps</code> folder. And adding this bit to the file,\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><code>filter:<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n\"classname\" \"env_shake\"<br>\r\n}</code></blockquote>\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n========\r\n\r\n<ul><li>\r\nPicture in the end - <a href=\"http://noahbradley.com\">Noah Bradley</a><br>\r\n<li>Permission & Help with surf_skyworld_rave - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/344049\">Xenon</a>\r\n<li>Textures - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/669550\">Skyppy</a>\r\n<li>Glass/Metal Textures - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/1024864\">z3phyr</a>\r\n<li>Halo Textures - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/328443\">Burnfingers</a>\r\n<li>Dev Neon Textures - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/850683\">Wolves Assault Hero</a>\r\n<li>Dev Textures - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/274308\">Chris528</a>\r\n<li>Voice Icon - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/1313766\">AlmaLynx</a>\r\n<li>Water Knife - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/99425\">Lukey</a>\r\n<li>Amazing Skybox - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/289553\">komaokc</a>\r\n<li>MPBhops - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/468063\">Aoki</a>\r\n<li>Unbreakable Boosts - <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/883044\">Badges</a>\r\n<li>Original Skyworld - Brokensurf\r\n<li>Foliage Models - jorpakko\r\n<li>Foliage Models - cheroke(?)\r\n\r\n<br><br>Music:<br>\r\n<li>Kindred Spirit by <a href=\"http://www.marcusd.net/\">Marcus D</a>\r\n<li>Moments in Love by <a href=\"http://www.theartofnoiseonline.com/\">Art of Noise</a>\r\n<li>Conchencha Voz by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sunmonx\">Sunmonx</a>\r\n<li>Pleiadian Friend Mix by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/spacemind2012?feature=watch\">Spacemind</a> (and other representing authors)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"><i>I am sorry if I missed your name, I had these materials for a long time and if the folder doesn't have your name it is hard for me to find who made them. \r\nIf you notice that I used your texture and didn't credit you, please contact me and I will add your name promptly.</i></font>\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS:\r\n===============\r\n<ul><li>Tony Montana - Music Suggestions\r\n<li>Xenon - Help and permission for skyworld\r\n<li>Stinger & TopHattWaffle - Only 2 tutorials on particle editor\r\n<li>Major Yelle - Help with Propper</ul>\r\n\r\nBETA TESTERS:\r\n=============\r\n<ul><li>Aimer\r\n<li>blacky\r\n<li>eh, eh!\r\n<li>Panzer\r\n<li>Snow\r\n<li>Tony Montana\r\n<li>Turk0lu</ul>"
