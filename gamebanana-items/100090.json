You must clear the  immediate area of all Terrorist and sometimes Counter-terrorists. Just plant and leave the hostage then walk away.\r\n\r\nLots of little things, look for the clues and experiment.\r\n\r\nFor smaller servers that like to mess around and stuff there is an \"admin post\" which is an invisible platform on all edges except one. You can only no clip/teleport/fly there.\r\n\r\nKeep gravity at the normal level, otherwise you'll miss something great. It will still work, just not as cool.\r\n\r\nPlease do not rip, decompile or anything else to this level. Thanks."
