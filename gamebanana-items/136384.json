	"_sText": "This is the second released version of my ruins series.  \r\n\r\nNearly everything in this version is exact to fy_ruins_dawn, besides a few main differences.  The changes are as followed...\r\n\r\n    * All weapons removed from map (For Gun Game compatibility)  -note below\r\n    * 4 sets of grenades, (Flash, Smoke, HE) located at highest pillars/collumns.\r\n    * Advanced Lighting (Map Compiled with -final for Better Lighting Quality)\r\n    * Added a few more breakable objects into the map and repositioned some others.\r\n\r\nAnd last,\r\n\r\n    * Back again...   This version of ruins DOES CONTAIN the original scalable blocks that are triggered by buttons.  (SEE SHORT MOVIES BELOW FOR DETAILS)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.  I would also hope to get this map hosted on as many Gun Game servers out there as possible.  So if you have a server you are hosting this on, please let me know your server I.P. so I can stop by sometime!\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/COLTUyRCZDs\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/COLTUyRCZDs\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/xlUK8-8BYKM\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/xlUK8-8BYKM\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></embed></object>"
