But first they will have to endure many traps controlled by the terrorists in the center. There are 32 spawn points for the counter-terrorists and there are two spawn points for the terrorists.\r\n\r\nAll traps are original with a little help from some people.\r\n\r\nThankyou to:\r\n\r\nAstonished\r\nMajor Pain\r\nWaffles\r\nMr. Tissue\r\n\r\nfor helping me with my map and finding all the glitches to fix.\r\n\r\nThere is a secret credit room in the map.\r\nBut, it will kill you at the same time as the Spawn Room will so get out of there before that happens.\r\nThe afks will be killed in 65 seconds.\r\n\r\nThankyou,\r\nTrexx\r\n\r\nThanks to Karatek√§fer for the skybox :)\r\nThanks to Chrazini (Guest) for the prefabs letters.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS: to everyone who played my map for the first day to find the glitches and of course Major Pain.\r\n\r\nThis version has two terrorists, download this. ty."
