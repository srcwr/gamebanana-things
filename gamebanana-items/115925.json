	"_sText": "Newest Flashbangsknives! After some testing, I decided flashbangsknives_v3 wasn't good enough. Instead I immediately started v4. It has been tested on my server, and is known to have some bugs. Unfortunately I can't fix them. \r\nYou might:\r\n-die before being able to play\r\n-have 4 hp when hitting the ground\r\nAlso, I've added some smoke grenades and a normal HE grenade.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Set the gravity to 780! If not, you will die/you will start with more than 1 HP.\r\n\r\n"
