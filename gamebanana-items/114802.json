But there's couple of places\r\nwhere you can get up and breath.\r\n\r\nWhen you are suddenly losing your health,\r\nit doesn't mean that someone shot you.\r\nOften it means that you don't have oxygen,\r\nthen you have to get to a place where you can\r\nbreath. It's easy to find the place, just look\r\naround and somewhere in the ceiling\r\nyou maybe see a light, go there.\r\nOr if you don't see those places,\r\nkeep looking, you will found them."
