	"_sText": "This is a breakfloor based map. You shoot down to break the blocks.\r\n\r\nAt the very bottom is a bomb site. Whichever terrorist has the bomb shoots down and plants the bomb. The bomb site is around a picture on the ground. The bottom has some scattered blocks down there and four blocks in the corner to help you get back up. Also use those scattered blocks to get up!\r\n\r\nTo help you know where you are, there are different colored lights in each spawn and one color at the bottom. The blue lights represent the CT side and the Red lights represent the T side. While your digging your way through the blocks you might see green light. This means that your close to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere are 16 spawn points in each spawn. Recommended/Maximum Players is 32.\r\n\r\nScreen shot A is the two spawns with different colors.\r\n\r\nScreen shot B is the bottom where the bomb site is.\r\n\r\n- Conch"
