By this drill, I expect that a duet can test it and report me if it works\r\n It is even possible as certain level is impractical, or too easy... That is why I shall need you to test it. (Also see if textures are good).\r\nThe levels are not very hard, because I could not test it, I have to choose average levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- 16 slots."
