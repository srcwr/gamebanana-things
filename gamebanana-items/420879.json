It is likely the starting point of Left 4 Dead, and for those of you who have heard the name \"Terror-Strike\" before, you will love to get the chance to play this prototype level.<br><br>My upload fixes a texture by adding a new material for it. I have also created an overview texture, generated a nav mesh, and added a level description, all of which are conveniently packed into the bsp itself for maximum convenience. Try it out and let me know how you think!<br>"
