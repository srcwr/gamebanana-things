	"_sText": "Aim_flank Is the first map of mine I have decided to release for Cs:s.\r\n\r\nMy overall aim for making this map was to bring team work into the mix more than having everyone go off rambo all on there own. \r\n\r\nEvery area in the map has 2 or more flanks to watch out for, so no matter where you are you allways have a blind spot where the enemy could be. This in theory helps to make the team work together and allways be moving, rather than just camping one area the whole round by yourself.\r\n\r\n-Some area's are dark, so i recommend having flashlights turned on.\r\n\r\n-Shadows sometimes show through walls on the middle hallways on the second level.\r\n\r\n-Sometimes ragdolls glitch on the stairs closest to the spawn point.\r\n\r\nPlease message me with suggestions on how I can improve this map, it would be much apretiatied.\r\n\r\n-Sylosis."
