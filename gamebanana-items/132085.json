	"_sText": "After doing allot of work on thismap,its finaly done.\r\nit started as the idea to make 36rooms connected to eachother by breakable doors,so that you would notknow where you would end up.\r\nyou could encounter some brain hungry zombies or some camping ct's.\r\nor maybe the exit to a higher level.\r\nif you escaped out of the cellar you will reach a small dome with a fortres inside it,inside there you get a great camping spot. \r\nalso some higher grounds that can only be reached by jumping on some boxes.\r\nonce you go higher up the map youwill go outdoors,its almost pitchblack except for some streetlanterns.there, you will find some stacked containers wich will have to be jumped if you want to go up top.\r\nonce you go down the hill you will reach the street with lots of destroyed cars and trucks,perfect for chases.\r\n\r\ni used allot of occluders so you will get good fps\r\ni hd allot of fun making and testing this map,i hope you will enjoy playing it.\r\nif you are an admin from a zombie server please contact me if you are interrested in running my map on his server.\r\n"
