	"_sText": "Gungame map, with buyzone included.\r\n\r\nThis map features a scrap yard. It was a concept I've never seen applied in a gungame map. It's possible to walk underneath some cars and there are two passages from the center to the sides (or vice-versa) in the car columns. There are plenty of sniping spots up in certain cars or crouching behind others. The FPS values are pretty good for this kind of map, and it's really fun to play in a scrap yard. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it ;)"
