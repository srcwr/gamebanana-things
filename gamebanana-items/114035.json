I place a house, birds, plants and it becomes the map.\r\nThe first I make is the \"springriver\", after to terminate this I purpose myself to make the same map but in winter.\r\n\r\nI'm in a creativity crisis and I make this \"fy\" map to kill time, but I were a great project in the background. \r\n\r\nSee you, enjoy iT! \r\n\r\nPD: Is a FY map that you can buy in the player spawn."
