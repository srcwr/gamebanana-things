	"_sText": "This is my second map. It is a map thatis supposed to be fast-paced. There are three ways to get to the enemy. First, there is the straight up rush, this route goes right up the middle to the enemy spawn(beware of grenades). Next is the stealthy way, the up and over. This route includes rushing in and getting above/ behind the enemy. Lastly, the breakable block tunnel, my favorite. It is a long tunnel that goes to the enemy base, but is a surprise attack.\r\n\r\nENJOY!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap by: Zilla-Poon"
