	"_sText": "Started this ages ago, and finally got around to fixing it for beta release. Please comment and share your suggestions on how I can make the map better. I'm aware of some minor displacement glitches in the \"underground\" area, but that's a quick fix and doesnt affect the gameplay. It's a combat surf map with various weapons, buyzone, 32 spawnpoints on each team, and so on. \nHope you enjoy the map :)\n\nPS: My pc has some sort of weird bug where the sky and water get full of white pixels.. Anyone got any idea what might cause this?\n\nThanks,\nBrave :)"
