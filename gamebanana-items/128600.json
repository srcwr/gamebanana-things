	"_sText": "The map has 11 traps with different enviroments. Some are easy, some are pretty hard. I made the bhop part to teleport players back to start because using a trigger_hurt would be kinda hard for players. The explosion in the background city is just a random thought.\r\n\r\nMusic can be turned off from CSS settings.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs or so to me in comments.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n==================\r\n- Removed the displacement hole at spawn and replaced it with a brush hole. This was done because some players got stuck in the hole for some reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Black room with lights has a sprite trail which will guide you through the correct route.\r\n\r\n- Made some platforms at the first climb wider and longer, so it will be a bit easier to climb.\r\n\r\n- Now many people can finish the map with points and correct ending. The hole will be different every time, so nobody can \"leech\" their way to victory.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- Fixed: the correct way in the final trap didn't change.\r\n\r\n- Added a wall to prevent two or more people from going in to press the final button\r\n\r\n- Added a new bhop trap in a rocky pit"
