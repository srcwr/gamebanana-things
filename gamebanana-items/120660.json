This is the first release of this map so please DL it and tell what I can do to make it more fun :D Some custom textures were used along with standard textures. I think the NAV file is included. Spinning thing in middle does 5 dmg/sec. There is also an unfolding tower. Also there is no fall damage. You can find the prefab for the laser bridge <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/2055\">here</a>\r\n\r\nNeeds one more assessment!!!!\r\n\r\nPrefabs:\r\n\r\nCorner Stairs - Ruff\r\nTron Crate - JLM\r\nUnfolding tower v2 - NAK93\r\nDev_building - Demonsoul1616\r\nawsome human canon - smurfii\r\nWeidey's Tripline - Weidey"
