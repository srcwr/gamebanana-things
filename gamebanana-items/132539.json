	"_sText": "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nThank you for taking an interest in my map. I have been out of the mapping scene since the early days of TFC, so I am very excited about this release. It is the first version so any bug or glitches found I would be happy to hear about. \r\n\r\nI have to thank all the guys over at {BHF} as well, they where all such a huge help in making this.\r\n\r\nHope everyone enjoys it!\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\nThis is an Aztec themed map, in which the premise is to use \"jump pads\" scattered throughout the level to access the \"camping points\". There are a few hidden secretes and traps as well. The map relies on shooting accuracy and team work, no barricades here, so don't expect to live long solo. This is a very large map so make sure it is played with at least 18 people.  \r\n\r\n=========================\r\n*V2\r\n1.Fixed spawning issue where players would get stuck to each other\r\n2.Added arrow textures to jump pads to show the correct launch direction\r\n3.Shortened beginning to allow more time for players to set up throughout the level\r\n4.fixed some random textures\r\n========================="
