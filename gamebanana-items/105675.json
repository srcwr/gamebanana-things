	"_sText": "Best texture map i have ever made. sometimes it requires alot of people to play. there are great surf and bhop locations allover the map. to anyone who putis it on their server, i strongly suggest the setting sv_airaccelerate 100, so that you can surf the ramps. it is a really well made texture map and i think more people should get the chance to play it.(thats why i put it on fpsb) \r\n\r\n=) Happy Downloads"
