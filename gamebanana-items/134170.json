It's a pretty simple map designed for GunGame servers, everything in that map can break (the \"houses\" that is) so its pretty much a map for short rounds, if you know what i mean. There are no buy zones cause the map is designed for GunGame servers. \r\n\r\nExtract Files to: \r\nC:\\Programmer\\Steam\\steamapps\\account_name\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\nIf you like the map rate it!
