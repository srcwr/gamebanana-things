	"_sText": "This map is semi bot usable most bots will get shot. The terriosts plant the bomb at B all the time. They dont seem to plant it at A.there are some movable objects,Bomb explosion has very nice effecs, some textures are from de_rats, radio music, lots of tunnels (mouse holes), lots of ladders, vents, mouse burner if you want to kill your player,mouse burner Effects (heat wave), Furniture, pictures, Its not the best map but rate it good. Note there is very little gliches. bases are protected so you can move out without getting shot if you move into mouse holes you should be fine.\r\n"
