There are NO buyzones so regular play in this map would not be good at all since you would be stuck with spawn pistols the whole time.\r\n\r\nThis map was made by me and compiled by Darkdessertion sy, my (thanks dude). \r\n\r\nThe textures that make this map are the reflectivity texture, I used all the reflectivity textures except 2 of them (so I used 8 different textures). There are ladders and several different levels of the map to go to. \r\n\r\nIf you fall off the side of the map for any reason, you will be automatically killed by a trigger I have under the map that does 10,000 damage to you once you hit it. This will help so people won't get stuck under the map."
