Your css config folder is located at Steam\\SteamApps\\*Your Account*\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\cfg\\.\r\n5. After that you are ready to go play some css!\r\n\r\nCustomize:\r\n\r\nIf you know even little bit about css commands you should go and open Wreakz2011high/low.cfg\r\nwith a text editor like notepad. There is lot of settings what you can customise and\r\nmake mine configs even better for you. I prefer you to customise crosshair and mouse settings\r\nbecause i cant know which settings is best for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemeber rate and give me some feedback! (:"
