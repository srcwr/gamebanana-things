	"_sText": "Not made by me, Eskanasi. But by someone else. This map is a very difficult pure surf map. You will die a lot. \r\n\r\nI use sv_airaccelerate 99 and sv_accelerate 99 to beat this map roughly 2/5 times. \r\n\r\nI noticed this map wasn't on FPSBanana and I doubt it will be a big hit because there is little/no killing involved. My best time for this map is 1 minute 21 seconds. Of pure surfing.\r\n\r\nOnce again credits do not go to me. I just noticed that this map wasn't up here.\r\n\r\nI have played this map by myself on my own created server. It's fun, as I like to surf more than I like to kill people, and the most popular surf maps are bloody easy.\r\n\r\nI do not know how many spawn points are in the map. Or any details that may interest someone looking to put this map on their server.\r\n\r\nMy rar file is 827 kilobytes. But the map is 11 megabytes. Therefore I am uploading this and then checking out my own .rar file."
