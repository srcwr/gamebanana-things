Basically every level has the same layout, textures, etc, yet the gameplay itself is always different in some weird way. Yes I know the game this is based off of is very old, &nbsp;but the idea to make this just popped into my head out of nowhere.&nbsp;<br><br>I also somehow hit the entity limit from too many lights so I had to delete half of them.... hmmm&nbsp;<br><br>Enjoy :)"
