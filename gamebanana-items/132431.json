They helped the map become what it is, so far!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n------------------\r\nWelcome to the neighborhood! To start off, this neighborhood might seem a bit off to you. Why you ask? Well, basically this won't be like any other neighborhood you've experienced. We have plenty of secret areas, traps, cadeable spots, and tons of room to just RUN! I mean c'mon, what other neighborhood has traps?\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n------------------\r\n- 64 Spawns\r\n\r\n- Mansion, Smaller House, Tool Shed, Pool, Cargo Plane, Doom Truck, Bunker, Treehouse, Greenhouse, Mine Shaft, and Parking Lot.\r\n- **Traps include:** Flame Ramp (Plane), Gas Chamber (Greenhouse), Laser Grid (Bunker) and a defensive trap in the Doom Truck.\r\n\r\n- Map will work with both unlimited  and limited ammo servers. \r\n\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL:\r\n\r\n1. Unzip contents of file and extract folder to cstrike.\r\n2. Enjoy!"
