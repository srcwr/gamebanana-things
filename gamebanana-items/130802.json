	"_sText": "This is my first ZE map, which I made from scratch taking ideas from here and there.\r\n\r\nThere are three different routes which contain different spots to hold and traps, and that lead to the same place: A bridge and then the lab. From the lab you'll be sent to the lower levels of the building and you'll have to go to the old train station to activate the train and escape. You will have to hold the train for 75 seconds, so you'd better prepare well.\r\n\r\nThis map is a typical Zombie Escape map with lots of places where you have to resist and some secrets, including a code-protected door and a rocket launcher.\r\n\r\nTo make gameplay easier, some console messages will tell you what to do, but basically you have to leave in a train before a missile is launched (As in most escape maps)\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
