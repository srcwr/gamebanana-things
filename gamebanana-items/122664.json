	"_sText": "Welcome to Surf_Odyssey.\r\n\r\nAhead lies a test to challenge your surfing skills.\r\n\r\nPut simply, you must surf through all the rings along the course. Should you miss one, you will be teleported back to the beggining and will have to start again.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, you will come across special rings. These can be identified by the yellow and black markings. When you surf through these, a weapon will be dispenced. The further along the course, the better the weapon.\r\n\r\nAfter 5 mins, all players will be teleported to a fight arena where players will use the weapons they pick up along the surf course.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who helped in the testing of this map. Please come join us on our freindly surf server: 60.234.73.177:27015. You will be more than welcome.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nSkybox By  hipshot\r\n\r\nRiddler"
