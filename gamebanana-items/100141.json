This map is a re-make of the original xbox cs_miami map.  I am still in the early stages of making maps but they are getting better. \r\nNow, about the map:\r\nCounter-Terrorists: Your objective is to rescue the hostages located inside of the bank. (for servers with this map you might want to tell counter-terrorists to not spawn camp.)\r\nTerrorists: Your goal is to prevent the counter-terrorists from rescuing the hostages."
