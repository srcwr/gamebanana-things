	"_sText": "The blue sqaure pieces of glass you see in a couple of the screenies are breakable. They are there to try and prevent spawn killing. Alot of the crates you see are physboxes and are also breakable. They are physboxes to try and make the map kind of unpredictable as they fall differently each round (hopefully). I've still got some stuff i want to do to this map but i wanted to submit it now because i'm happy with it as it is, for now. And to get some suggestions on how to improve it. Currently working on V2."
