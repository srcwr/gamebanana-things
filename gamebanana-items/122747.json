Circle endlessly if you like, killing as you go.\r\n\r\nStage 2:\r\n\r\n A linear surf. This is intended to allow you to get some on the ramp kills or some sniper shots. Use the spining circle to circle back and try to get some more ramp kills.\r\n\r\nStage 3:\r\n\r\n This stage is a short surf with the jail and bombsite as the main focus.\r\n\r\n!: Pro\r\n\r\n\r\nThis download also includes the dm version of the map.
