I've tried to pay attention to the possibilities of gameplay, offering fast rounds without any lame deaths.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Three main knife battle spots.</li>\r\n<li>Two handgun locations for taking out the opposition's assault location.</li>\r\n<li>Two assault rifle spots with a high vantagepoint, but with minimal (partially destroyable) cover.</li>\r\n<li>Underwater route containing SMG's on either side.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nEvery route connects back to the others in a fun simplistic way to keep you battling for many rounds to come."
