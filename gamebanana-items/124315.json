	"_sText": "So, first map (2nd actually, first 'good' one hasn't been released yet). I created a bhop practice map, as you can see in the name, where there are different kind of courses to go through. Dont say that the design sucks, i know, i created this for 1-2 hours only.&nbsp;<br><br><h1>Spawns are in the same area, so choose whatever team you want.</h1><h1><b>Features:</b></h1>-First, the large red squares. I know that you cant fall through them because they are too close to each other, but all you have to do is act that you can fall through. Im gonna have to put this in the next version.<br><br>-Light red sqaures. Like the other one, but you can actually fall through them! More spacing and smaller.<br><br>-Circles. A straight line of circles that you can fall through in between (kindof)<br><br>- The straight, slightly broken and the broken straight lines. They are just for ADAD air strafing bhops.<br><br>-There are two sides in the map, the short one, and the long one. The long one is just doubled the length of the short one.<br><br>- There is a ramp going downwards at the side of the map for downhill bhops.<br><br>- At the end of each course, the floor, and the bottom of the ramp, there are blue platforms (nothing on floor) that teleports you back in spawn.<br><br><h2>Im free to suggestions because this is just the first version of the map. Im a new mapper so, this is just a first for me.</h2><h3>As i told up here in this post, i have an unreleased map and im planning to release it too. I dont think that i need to playtest it even more since both sides are symmetrical and its small and is a gungame map.</h3><h1><span class=\"GreenColor\">HOPE YOU LIKE IT!&nbsp;</span></h1>"
