Then copy everything in it into your map. Then continue the track.\n\nNeed help or a bug?:\nYou can ask me in feedback ! I'll try to help you but I do not promise you that I can solve everything !\n\nYou have an suggestion?:\nSo feedback me ! It will help me a lot in improving my \"mod\"\n\nOne last word:\nDon't forget to credit me if you're using my prefab!\n\nI hope you will enjoy my work !"
