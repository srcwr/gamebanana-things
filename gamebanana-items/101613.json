Also I want to thank all the A+ [TurkKlan](http://turkklan.com \"T端rk Klan\") CS:S server for testing the map.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first bomb/defuse map. I made 35hp/Knife maps and an mg map before but this is my first non-fun map. There might be some problems concerning balance. I tried to eliminate this as much as possible. Hopefully, I was succesful.\r\n\r\nOf course I'm open to critism but constructive ones will be appreciated :)\r\nHope you enjoy it, Sinsic\r\n\r\n---\r\nStory;\r\nA terrorist group were hired for a bombing by a goverment but the mission was unsuccesful and one of the terrorist was captured dead. His body is currently at the Coroner's office and the documents that connects him to the terrorist group are stored at the Koban Police office.\r\nSince the goverment who hired the group (secretly) doesn't want this to go public, the terrorists must either destroy the documents which are at the Police office or their fallen brothers body which is at the Coroner's office.\r\n---"
