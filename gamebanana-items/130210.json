This is my first try as you can see, it's a small zombie map made for small servers such as fe-gaming.net's zombie server. \r\n\r\nI'm going to train and improve allot in the future, it's hard to map (If you ask me) but it's funny. The map might be alittle light but I hope it works out. You don't need to use it if you don't want to but please help me out and tell me what I can fix in it and so on. I've tried fixing the light but it doesn't work even if I delete tons of lights.\r\n\r\nYou can go ahead and edit this and make something out of it if you want to, I'd be glad if you did it but it's all up to you. Good luck and thanks for checking the map out!
