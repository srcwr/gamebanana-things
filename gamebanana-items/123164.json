FTW!\r\nxFire: RJOToxic\r\nThis map was my first map that I made with Hammer, in this addition:\r\n\r\nAdded more secrets.\r\nCompletely redone the jail.\r\nCompletely redone the PRO section of the map.\r\nFixed up some parts of the map to make it look a little more pleasing.\r\nRemove all loose guns, and replaced them with gun spawners.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank Freakout, -=Nyko=-A4J, iPalican, WhaThe, G-Daddy, Puss'N'Boots, Biohazard, Teeth, Roosta, and everyone else who has helped contribute to the ideas for the map.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secrets, some better than others, but it is your job to find them. There is one main secret that will give complete power to the person who finds it! Good luck! I have decompile-protected the map.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a new version of this map, please add me to your xfire, and have some maps present that you have done to show me you are worthy! :D\r\n\r\nIn the final version, I have changed a lot more, for the better. I have retextured the whole map, and I have made it an outside environment.I have remodeled the jail area. Me, Teeth, and Roosta tested it for glitches/errors, and I have fixed what we have found. If you find any please e-mail me at JediToxic@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-Toxic"
