	"_sText": "As you may have noticed I have used a real existing bank, Shawnee Bank (Shawnee Town, Kansas) as a preference when I have made this prefab. \r\n\r\nHere is an image of the real bank: http://www.digado.com/shawnee_bank.jpg\r\n\r\nThe Bank has two reachable floors, the cellar and first floor. The upper floor can of course be remade and made reachable if you wish. I have put plenty of effort to make the Bank optimized with NO DRAW textures and Areaportals on cellar and first floor. \r\n\r\nFor those who are new to Hammer, simply ungroup the prefab when you have put it somewhere on your map and you can modify it as you would do with any entity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you plan to use this bank in an official release, please let me know, it would make me happy :D"
