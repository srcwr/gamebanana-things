	"_sText": "This map is for all the lazy people, who just want to get those darn, new achievements. I started making it for my achievement whoring friends, so we can go back to regular play as soon as possible. While they were farming, they gave me feedback and I modified stuff, until now. It's not perfect, it wasn't ever ment to be. I just wanted to give everyone without basic HAMMER skills a chance, to farm.\r\n\r\nSome facts about the map:\r\n- 1 T spawn, 35 CT spawns\r\n- cfg with all recommended cmds is included\r\n- CT bots just have 5 HP, farming goes pretty fast\r\n- CT weapons are located on a table to your right\r\n- you can get 1000 kills in less than 5 minutes\r\n- if you aim for the head, you don't even have to reload once\r\n\r\nA readme with every step to get it running is included.\r\n\r\nHave Fun!\r\n\r\nPS: I will not develop it any further and my HAMMER skills are pretty basic, just FYI. If I think about it, it is even my first public released map ever."
