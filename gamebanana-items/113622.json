The glass on this map is great, if you see someone using it to get into your spawn you can shoot it from under them and make them fall to their death :)\r\n\r\nThere are 16 spawn points on this map, but i can not imagine it been any fun for more than 6 players.\r\n\r\nI made this map for my clan G4F^ (www.g4fclan.info)\r\n\r\nHave fun playing, i know we do!\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nIf you make one tower collapse, they both collapse. I have no idea how to fix this."
