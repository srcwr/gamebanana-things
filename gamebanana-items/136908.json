	"_sText": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nGreyfrog started this map and then I finished for him. By doing that I recreated his map again because he had already textures in there that was missing and I click replace all, but that didn't work lol? \r\n\r\nSo anyways I made into a crazy map, then into a insane map. I added teleports the map to make it more interesting. And made the map more death feel with its craziness going on. Also I remade the map for my clan The Devil's Rejects. Visit the clan forums @ www.tdrgg.net or you can play in our gg sever @ 208.100.36.228:27015.\r\n\r\nYou can also request to join Frog's studio: http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/21652\r\n\r\nIf you download this map, plz rate and comment on our map. Because, We both work hard on this and all we ask in return is just rate and comment our map.\r\n\r\nty & Enjoy!\r\n\r\nMadcow777\r\nGreyfrog_Designs"
