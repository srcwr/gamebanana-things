I decided to go with a prefab pack of a few things;\r\nContent:\r\nA Tower, A Cabin, A Bridge, A Hut, Base of the tower\r\n\r\nI intended to make a better showcase map but this was thrown together in the space of two minutes about 3 minutes to midnight!  So it is what it is!  The content is good though so try it out!  \r\n\r\nNote I: Please Credit me on release of your map if you use one of my prefabs, (Terrora).\r\n\r\nNote II: If you have any suggestions for future prefabs please tell me! And I will do my best to make it for you asap!\r\n\r\nThanks Alex (Terrora / Roluffy)"
