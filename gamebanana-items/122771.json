Finally, after 3 months of hard work I present surf_pure!\r\nThis map is a 7 stage surf map, started by me. I thought of the idea from using \r\nthe textures I used on stage 9 in my previous map, surf_elixor. This map has gone\t\r\nthrough some shit lawl, starting out as a linear, i made the spawn and made stage\r\none and decided to make it stage one for a new surf map, which was going to be called\r\nsurf_amped, but I decided not to use that, too used. So, I decided what i was going\t\r\nto do was make 3 stages, spawn, and jail, and then get someone else (originally Razer)\r\nto make 3 more stages, making a 6 stage map. I made 3, he made 2 (ran out of time) \r\nand so I decided to ask around. Unfortunatly, no one would make 3 stages...so I decided\r\nto have others help. I deleted one of my stages, and let others join in. I later made a\t\r\nnew spawn, which makes it so where people see us who made it in the beginning, lawl.\r\nSo I made that, got an ass-load of errors, then fixed them, and got some stuff ready, and\r\nwa-la. Surf_pure. Jail is IceSkate, for all who don't know how to iceskate, i suggest you \r\nlearn.
