I am putting it out as a beta, so please email me at mapping_predator@ h o t mail dt cm (despammed) if you have any comments or suggestions.  I designed it small and tight to up the tension - people who have tried it so far have liked it - I hope you do too.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSand - Beta 1.0\r\n\r\nBomb defusion map.\r\n\r\nmapping_predator@ h o t mail dt cm\r\n\r\n4th July 2006, Saitama, Japan (I'm Australian - go figure :P)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nStory:\r\nIn the Wild Wild West, lone gunslinger \"Blondie\", Mexican bandit \"Tuco the Rat\" and the deadly ex army man \"Angel Eyes\" find themselves on a collision course, when they each try to find a lost gold shipment.   The amazing graveyard finale will live on forever in cinematic history.  Now, some 150 years later, terrorists have heard about the gold hidden in the unmarked grave, and are hell-bent on finding it.  If the CT's make it too hard, however, they'll settle on some mercenary work in blowing up the nearby army bridge.  \r\nInspired by the legendary Clint Eastwood movie \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\", de_sand is a small, tight map, yet with ample cover and sniping spots.  You can even go pray in the chapel if things get too much.  Challenge for spectators...find the hidden credits screen.\r\n"
