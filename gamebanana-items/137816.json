Wanted to make something that resembled the older maps of surf, in both form and function, along with a few other interesting gimmicks. Big thanks to the testers and everyone else who helped with the map. Also a big thanks to the Momentum Mod mapping discord for answering my dumb questions. Let me know what you think and enjoy the map!<br><br>Thanks to draph for the showcase video!<br><br>T4 Linear, 3500 maxvel"
