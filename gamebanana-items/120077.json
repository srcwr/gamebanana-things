Just looking to do something a bit different than the usual \"ultra-realistic\"-type stuff. \r\n\r\nFlying V works best with low grav, 200 seems ideal. It is still fun at normal grav, but I highly advise playing it on low grav! It's MUCH more fun and I have adjusted the height of platforms to work best at 200.\r\n\r\nINSTALLING THE MAP\r\nDecompress the files into your cstrike directory. Please include ALL these files in your install and do not redistribute this zip without them all! Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe files included in the zip are the following:\r\n\r\ncstrike/\r\n         /maps/hh_arena_flying_v.bsp\r\n         /maps/hh_arena_flying_v.txt\r\n         /\r\n         /materials/hellhole/hellhole_arena_banner.vmt\r\n         /materials/hellhole/hellhole_arena_banner.vtf\r\n\r\nREADME.rtf (the file you're reading right now)\r\n\r\nBig thanks to cs1vet and all the guys of the PTK clan (www.ptkklan.com) for all their support and pwnage! You guys are the bomb!\r\n\r\nThanks and hope you enjoy! If you like this map, tell your friends and upload it to your servers. Just make sure you include all the files please, and look for more Hell Hole maps on this and other maping sites.\r\n\r\n~Hell Hole\r\n"
