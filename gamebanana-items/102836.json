	"_sText": "Hello there,\r\n\r\nso here it is finally - my very first map. It took me almost 3 months to build this map before it could be released. Inspiration I got from ICS who helped me through this whole hammer mess. So, big thanks to him. The map is very intense, fast and most situations will happen in very quick pace. I've been working on my next release and hope I can get it done soon. It is also de_ map but I'm hoping to release it as as_ map also. Hope you enjoy this release.\r\n\r\nGreets,\r\nHakk1tus\r\n\r\nPS. found couple bugs and now been fixed.\r\nPPS. Keidas is finnish word and its oasis in english."
