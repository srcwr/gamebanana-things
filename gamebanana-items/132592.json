	"_sText": "This was quick map for a map contest. Tons of custom models and textures.  I based the design on the mod type, lots of ways to block passages and change the game play. The trees look a little funky, but I needed some fuller than the standard models or other trees I created before. Since I am at the deadline, there is one problem there is custom pallet that is missing it's gib pieces due to a bspzip malfunction and did not have enough time to make an overview. Bots play very well, custom tuned nav mesh w/ nameplaces. There is a buy zone for the t's so the map plays as expect on regular CS:S. Comments are welcome."
