	"_sText": "This is a single-player (though more than 1 player can be on the map at the same time) CSS obstacle course training map.  You must make your way through the 4 areas: Earth, Air, Fire, Water in the fastest time possible.  You are timed and the results are displayed on the digital display in the starting area.  Entry into each area will be noted on the status board.\r\nYou are timed from when you jump into the Earth zone to when you touch the exit door.  There are 6 T and 6 CT spawns but everyone should be on the same team so you can watch progress on the radar.\r\nCreated for use in the [NtN] Clan Olympics, have fun and no speed hacks!"
