This version of the map (v1.0) is brushed with develop textures which many Gun Game players enjoy. This map was originally released for [Day of Defeat: Source](http://dods.gamebanana.com/ \"Day of Defeat: Source\"). Some changes to the map where made. All of the control points have been removed. Approximately 20 of the original props have been removed or replaced. Some new blocks and features have been implemented to fit the Gun Game style of playing. The over all cosmetic structure of this map have remained authentic to the official release ([dod_105th](http://dods.gamebanana.com/maps/183715 \"dod_105th\")).\r\n\r\nThe password to the downloadable archive is \"**gamebanana**\".\r\n\r\nThank you for viewing my release.\r\n---------------------------------"
