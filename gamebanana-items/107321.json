Best enjoyed with many people playing, also included in .RAR archive is the same map but renamed gg_desertstorn, this is sp that it can be used with mods such as Gun Game without the problem of there being five-sevens everywhere.  .Nav files are included and it only used standard textures and models.  Have fun!!!"
