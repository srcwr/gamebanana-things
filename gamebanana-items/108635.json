It also has two grenades.\r\n\r\nIt will also make it easier to do the Akimbo King achievement(Use Dual Elites to kill an enemy player who also has Dual Elites equipped).\r\n\r\nI hope you like the map. Please rate and assess your thoughts or any suggestions on how to improve on this.\r\n\r\nMap by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/679991\"target=\"_blank\">3nD Of the Lin3</a>"
