All space of this map is a narrow corridors, a wide network of ventilation and some small warehouses and halls. There are a lot of opening doors (with a creaking sounds) that serves as a factor of opponent's uncovering and allows to make some cunning ambushes ;-)\r\n\r\nNote about Bombsites: In spite of the fact that Radar shows only one Bombsite (B), actually them here two is shown. Simply they are located one over another in rooms on different floors of the building.\r\n\r\nNote about Bots: Despite certain complicating factors (a set of doors and vents) Bots play on the map rather surely. It seems that the .nav-file (included in .bsp) was carefully hand-tuned. One more plus to the map author :-)\r\n\r\nHappy Frags... Play & Enjoy!"
