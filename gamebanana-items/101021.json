This is also my third ever First Person Shooter Map, so if there are any bugs or errors provide them in a constructive manner, not a flaming one.\r\n\r\nThis is the Spiritual Successor to de_supercede_v2, a previous map I made in which I lost the .bsp file and didn't feel like recreating the same map.\r\n\r\nde_apathy_v2 was made entirely by me, Nexolate. You may not copy, edit or redistribute this map anywhere else without my personal permission. Any bugs, suggestions or comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
