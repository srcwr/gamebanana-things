You'll notice a lot of gloaming features here,\r\nall credit goes to Roosta for original idea.\r\n\r\n***This is the beta version, your feedback will help me\r\nhelp you with how the final version will turn out***\r\n\r\nMade and played for 66 tick servers ONLY\r\n\r\nThis map wouldn't have been possible had it not been for \r\nthe following people:\r\n\r\nCorn Ibulus - (Map wouldn't have been released without this guy)\r\nRoosta\r\nsvbg869\r\nKnife\r\nKojin[g]\r\nBucketofPwnage\r\nPaper-Cut"
