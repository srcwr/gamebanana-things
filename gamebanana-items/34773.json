Some paths and ladders were builded from scratch completely. Also some auto-generated areas was remakes and reconnects manually.\r\n<br><br>Bots use all possible ways now, though some it is quite rare (however as well as people).<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh was fully Place Painted.<br><br>All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:&nbsp;Gattsu (for realistic and detailed arabic-themed map).\r\n<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:&nbsp;BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp;Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),&nbsp;CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n<br><br>Some other place, some other time... :-)"
