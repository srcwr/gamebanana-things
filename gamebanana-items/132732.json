	"_sText": "DESCRIPTION**: It is an Zombie mod based map, u may ask what is a Zombie mod? well Zombie mod is a different kind of gameplay wich is based in survive as long as possible and cooperate with your team mates to avoid being zombified, in case u get zombified go hunt some of your old team mates. It has a lot of places to hide and resist the zombie atacks. I tried to make a balanced map for both sides, it means there are NO INVINCIBLE PLACES, yes.. those places where the ppl go in mass and camp like crazy so zombie side lose all rounds, then u get bored and leave the server."
