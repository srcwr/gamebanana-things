	"_sText": "The map supports maximum teams of 24v24. There are 3 bombspots, 2 outside the bunker and 1 inside. T's start at the beach, CT's in the bunker.\r\nMap includes custom soundscapes and sounds, full bot nav and map overview.\r\n\r\nTheory Behind Map:\r\n\r\nEver since 1.3 (I stopped playing after 1.3 until Source), I always wanted to do a map of this sort - with a realistic battle feel of rushing up a beach to take a strongpoint. With the old HL engine, it simply wasnt possible due to its limitations.\r\nSoon as HL2 came out, I realised it was possible. With the excellent remake of de_prodigy, a lot of the textures that I would be needing were there ready.\r\nSo, I put it into Hammer and have made it :)\r\n\r\nThis is also timed with the 3 year existence of my clan, SFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map was also originally planned to include HDR after it had been released for CS:Source, however, the map file increased from 8Mb to a whooping 31Mb. Nobody is going to download a map that big, so I decided to take it for that reason alone. Which is a big shame, as it really made the map a LOT better.\r\n\r\nBottom line is, enjoy the map. Some good battles can be had and is great for that long range practising."
