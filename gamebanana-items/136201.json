	"_sText": "My new map based off a map from the game Turok Rage Wars for the N64. The map itself isn't exactly like the map from the origonal game, but I got some ideas from it. I was originally trying to make an exact replica of the map from the N64 game, but when I decided that I couldn't do that successfully, i took what I had already made and made a few creative changes to it and finished it up. And this is the finished version of the map. It does have a few slight errors, but nothing that will effect the gameplay at all. I had to make a huge box around the map itself so make sure that I wouldn't get any leaks since all the walls in the main map are only 5 units thick. I did also include buy zones for people who want to play regular gameplay.\r\n\r\nBut, I hope you enjoy the map!\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/VXTjRtjSy6k&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/VXTjRtjSy6k&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"
