	"_sText": "Hi,\r\nFirst of all, don't worry about the pistols hud on the screenshot. It's because the map is also made to be a DE_ , i had no time and then i took the screenshots on the all guns playable version. (But it's 100% the same map).\r\n\r\ni did this map today cause i was boring but i think you will really appreciate playing awp on this, the map is looking fun, simple but it also needs skills if you want to be a good player on this. \r\nThere's a lot of sniper places and some others secrets places.. \r\n\r\nthe Fy_ version is downloadable here : http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/179287\r\n\r\nCredits :\r\nMap made by simP (me) more about me ? steamcommunity.com/siimP , youtube.com/simP37\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to VERTEX for his prefabs pack, it was useful.\r\n\r\nBye everybody, enjoy awping on this"
