Again, thanks to Dotty for being awsm and also thanks to EnD-Gaming for being a sick clan.\r\n\r\nhow to install : drag the map from the .rar on your desktop, go to SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps | drop the map in the maps folder have fun - vay.\r\n\r\nPlease comment and rate if you download. I wanna see some critics.\r\nHave fun playing it, peace out!"
