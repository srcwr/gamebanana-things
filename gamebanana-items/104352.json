Hubble explains \"I'm not going to try porting it, I've started building it from scratch, so it's going to take a while!\"\r\n\r\nFrom my personal playing this is a terrific remake that gives the sense of classic Counter-Strike v1.x mapping and gameplay. This map also includes a terrific AI NAV files for blasting offline action.\r\n\r\nHopefully HDR shall be implemented \r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nReadme File:\r\nDE_TORN_HT by Hubbell Tyson\r\n\r\n\" This is a map I made for CSS, which is loosely\r\nbased on the CS 1.3 classic \"de_torn\" by Crinity.\r\n\r\nLatest Version: de_torn_ht_beta2\r\nAuthor: cWg | Hubbell Tyson (www.cowswithguns.co.uk)\r\nBuild Time: Approx 60 hours over a period of 3 weeks.\r\nCompile Time: Just under 5mins.\r\nFile Size: 5MB total, unzipped.\r\nSpawns: 40 total (20 per side).\r\nNav file is included in the zip, and has area names which appear on your HUD.\r\n\r\n- Improved FPS around A.\r\n- Revised layout at A.\r\n- Quite a lot more detail and sounds.\r\n- Added new room above fireplace which overlooks the central courtyard.\" "
