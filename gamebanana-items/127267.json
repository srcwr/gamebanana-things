	"_sText": "This is a very simple Deathrun map with 3 floors, it doesn't contain a lot traps - if it aint enough just tell me and I'll upgrade it. I'll love to get feedback, both positive and negative, so just post a comment below.\r\n\r\nThe map contains: - 14 Traps(Controlled by T) - 6 Random Traps - 60 CT Spawn points - 2 T Spawn points - 3 Secrets  - 4 Equipments with colortrail (3 of them have a custom figure too - like a hat)- a MP5 at the end with colors, for the first person to end the track\r\n\r\nThis is just a Beta, in the future I'll finish the final version which should be; Longer, maybe a different texture, more secrets and more/funnier endings. \r\n\r\nThank you."
