If you comment and\r\nask for it I will upload a list of every\r\nsecret in the map with pictures.\r\n_____________\r\n|Few secrets:\r\n|If you find a grenade in your cell, throw it towards the button to open the cells and cells will open if you damaged it.\r\n|On the Grenade Toss field you can jump into the arrow on the left to be teleported to armory.\r\n|Jumping onto the bookcase in the basement VIP room and crouching along will get you teleported to the Shot for Shot field where you will land on a Desert Eagle\r\n|Jumping off the bridge at the pool and onto the wall to the right when you face the GAMES sign will make you hit a full-wall ladder. Use it to go up in the corner and knife/shoot the wall you reach (on the top) to see a hidden room and get an AWP\r\n|Look down the gap at the Ice Race and you can see a little platform. Jump down onto it and crouch in to get teleported to armory.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nV2 UPDATES:\r\n- Made a basement as well as a couple secrets\r\n- Fixed a couple of errors\r\n- Put a delay on weapon and grenade spawners"
