	"_sText": "Basically this ia a bomb defusal map where the terrorists' gain is to plant a bomb in the area where the two APCs are located, to destroy them. The Counter Terrorists' goal is to prevent the Terrorists from planting and detonating the C4. The Counter Terrorists have a large amount of sniper points to hinder the terrorists from getting to the APC, whilst the Terrorists have a large amount of weapons ready for them. This map would be best played with at least 10 players on each team, and would be at it's peak with 64 players. "
