	"_sText": "A minigame i made with a little spare time.\r\n\r\nBasically you try to climb to the top of the hill while avoiding the rolling balls.  They can be jumped but as they bounce it doesnt work always.\r\nIf you are hit by a ball you will be teleported to the jail where you will have to knife other ball victims.  If a ball just nicks you then you will recieve a small amount of damage rather than be teleported.  If you make it to the top of the hill then you can grab the awp that is up there, and have a clear view of the jail and can clean up the survivors, also you can shoot any of the other team that may still be trying to make it to the top, so being quick is important. \r\n\r\ni put the countdown at the start because some servers have freezetimes and its just a chance to get ready if you were not paying attention\r\n\r\nit works well and i randomized the ball paths so it varies in difficulty every round, and there are no \"safe\" routes.\r\n\r\nenjoy and tell me what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to komaokc for his skybox."
