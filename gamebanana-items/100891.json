This port combined the distinctive features from both versions of initial map - <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346905515\" target=\"_blank\">de_3rdstrike_b1</a> & <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=477044277\" target=\"_blank\">de_3rdstrike</a>, though contains some changes in comparison with the both original sources, which have been made for the maximum variability and intensity of a gameplay.<br><br>Story:<br>   At first the suicide bomber was driving the truck with explosive. The second there was an attempt of shelling with the mortars... After these two heavy attacks the Terrorists have to make this 3rd assault on the government missile site a success. If they lose the imminent missile launch will wipe their military training camp off the face of the Earth!<br><br><span class=\"RedColor\"><i>NOTE:</i><br><i>This map has simply a diabolical weight 666 Mb, also was compiled this a hellcat almost 13 hours... but it's worth it! Happy owners of Ryzen 7 and GTX 1080 - let enjoy to the fullest! Sad losers with Celeron and Radeon R5 - let them drool with envy :-)</i></span><br><br>P.S. ~ All good things come in threes :-)<br><br>"
