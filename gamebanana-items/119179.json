With the same theme, but a different layout.\r\n\r\nMaptype: Awp\r\nNumber of Player: 32 (recommended 24)\r\n\r\nThis is also compatible with deathmatch.\r\n\r\nThe boxes and shapes are customly made into icecubes just for the beauty of it.\r\nThere is also falling snow and a start up sound, to give players the feel of being in the mountainous region.\r\n\r\nCredits to BenTheKuno for his amazing icemt skybox texture\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of bugs found that need to be fixed or anything that you wish to be improved.\r\n\r\nPlease assess my map also. :)\r\n\r\nThanks and have fun!"
