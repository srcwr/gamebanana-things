	"_sText": "This is a map geared more towards zombie mod (regular and horde) gameplay, if people seem to like it, I'll make a DE version. There are 50 terrorist spawns and 30 counter-terrorist spawns, terrorist spawn in the back and CT's spawn in the school and outside in the front. There are a few easter eggs, and the map is loosely based off of my school. There are three floors a basement, first floor, and second floor. \r\n\r\nThe textures are included in the map, and it is 45 MB. (If anyone knows of a way to decrease the size, let me know without altering the actual map [except settings or adding something])\r\n\r\n--SPOILER ALERT--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOILER:\r\nWhen you walk in, the lights turn off and can be turned on in the basement (the panel).\r\n\r\n"
