	"_sText": "This is one freaking crazy map, With 20 players a team, Only 4 rooms, and hallways in between, You'll experience extreme-fast paced action!!\r\n\r\nTip: Most guns can peirce these walls, So if an enemy runs out of sight, Spamming the walls may net you a kill, or two... Or maybe 5 if you're lucky :D\r\n\r\nThis is the Saturday, 25 November 2006 version, A much better improvement from first version where you would hit your head jumping, and all props removed from both spawns so you can actually run around now! \r\n\r\nI won't be updating this version, But there may be sequels of HallwayBlitz so stay tuned!\r\n\r\nPS: HallwayBlitz2 is has been released in some places but here, I will be updating that version by getting rid of the props in those spawns as well."
