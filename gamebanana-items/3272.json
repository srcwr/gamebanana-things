	"_sText": "A simple prefab that was easier to simply build than explain for use in <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/threads/143796\">this thread here</a> to help someone out.\r\n\r\nWhat was used to create this prefab:\r\n<i class=\"blue\">Keyframe_Rope x2\r\nMove_Rope\r\nLogic_Measure_Movement\r\nPhys_Ballsocket x2\r\nPoint_Spotlight\r\nLight_Spot\r\nProp_Physics_Multiplayer</i>\r\n\r\nSimple effect but fun to play with when used right. One could swap out the light_spot with dynamic to make a better visual but this is better for performance. Choice is yours :P\r\n\r\nFor now the rope will follow the lamp model when its moved/shot etc as you can see, but to add some more bounce to it a phys_spring on either side rather than hinges could produce better results, again for performance I went with ballsockets."
