There are more things to do.\r\n\r\nCheck out the screenshots.\r\n\r\nEDIT: After more testing it has been found that the left side teleport on the CT side is flawed and the player gets stuck in the wall. This will be a fix in v3 that comes out some time within the next 3 days.\r\n\r\nBugs found in v2:\r\n\r\nFlawed teleport\r\nWater too shallow\r\nToo bright\r\nWalls on 2nd level buildings can be shot through\r\nVery tough to jump over top and down onto battlefield area\r\n\r\nSome things missing that will be in v3:\r\n\r\ntrigger_push where the long straight walkways are so it goes quicker and you dont get shot\r\n\r\nDeeper water so you dont get health deducted when you fall\r\n\r\nA more intricately designed bunker in the middle\r\n\r\nFix up the awp arena so that there are places you can stand up and still be protected.\r\n\r\nDoors so you can exit the spawn area into the middle, yet you cant enter back in.\r\n\r\nTeleports that bring you back into your own spawn if you so desire.\r\n\r\nSome secrets\r\n\r\nFix bugs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe giant platform in the middle IS breakable. by the way\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n.4ngryToasters\r\nCleav420\r\nAnd the Interlopers forum regulars who helped me fix my compile problem!"
