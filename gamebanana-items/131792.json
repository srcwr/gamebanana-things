	"_sText": "zm_evilrats_final is the last and best version of my zm rat map, which is completely based on ag_rats. I added lots of secrets, barricading zones and basically things that allow zombie gameplay.\r\n\r\nI think that almost all if not all the 'cading spots are balanced enough to be not imposible, but it may depend of your server settings; for example, some spots may become a bit lame with zprops (with big ones, wood boxes and driers should be fine in most spots)\r\n\r\n40 slots, small size, I really recomend parachute and noblock. It's also a good idea to explore the map before playing because there are lots of secret places."
