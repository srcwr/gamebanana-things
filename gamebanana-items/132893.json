	"_sText": "Pretty straightforward map design, based off of one I did a year back for the CSSMC zombie server. Players are spawned in a large crater, and there are movable boxes scattered everywhere.\r\n\r\n (In the original, there was a crane overlooking the map, and was called \"dayoff\"; just a crane worker goofing off, was the \"backstory)\r\n\r\nThere is also, as in the original, a pretty decent concrete \"structure\" that can be defended, or attacked, with comparitive ease. Dead simple game play, but if it works as well as the original did, it'll be a hoot to play in a full server. Enjoy :)\r\n\r\nAnd please notify me if your server plans on using this or any other map I make. It doesnt matter if you do or not, but I'd sure like to see it in action :)."
