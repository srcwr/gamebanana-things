	"_sText": "The growroom i've been working on is ALMOST complete. There are a few more details i want to include in the map! This is a sneak peak.. The entrance to the grow room is down a hatch in  the garage on the top level where one team will start. The back door to the growroom is on the way other side, there is a steal door in the side of a cliff that lets you in complex (where the water is that you see in the screen shot.) There are hidden rooms and a lot of detail. Has anyone ever made a map like this? \r\n\r\nI dont know but i want your feedback!\r\n\r\nIf i spend the rest of the hours to make this is anyone going to load it on any servers!? \r\n\r\nlet me know guys"
