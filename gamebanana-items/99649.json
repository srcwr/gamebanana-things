	"_sText": "This is one of my first maps that I was working on which I have completely redone. I added a 3D Skybox in the map and I had to re-edit some of the textures to make it look better then the original. Also I added in some more lighting in the map including a light_environment and a env_sun. Also you might notice that I made placement markers in the map telling you where you are. This will be updated in the final when I get the .nav file updated with an overview map in the navigation area on the top of the screen like you see in de_dust. Also this map can host up 40-48 people. But I would recommend you only have 20-34 people at max. \r\n\r\nThanks for downloading the map and enjoy,\r\n<i>-=ETO=-Caboose (aka) Modmaster</i>"
