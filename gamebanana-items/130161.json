	"_sText": "I tested this with 5 friends and it was fun - though it is intended for larger crowds. I figure 6 + players is best for this one.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a map for my favorite GunGame server that is a little different than the normal gungame type map. It took a while to work out the kinks with the elevators - my friends kept getting killed by them - but I worked those out.\r\n\r\nThe elevators provide a unique flanking opportunity that is great fun, because you never know what they will bring up.\r\n\r\nAlso, the symbol you see used on the elevators / walls is the logo I use for my music.
