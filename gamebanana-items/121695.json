Your team may also teleport from spawn to each controlled base.\r\n\r\nAfter a base has been captured, the team will gain 5 points every 60 seconds (if it's left uninterrupted by the opposing team).\r\n\r\nEnjoy :D\r\n\r\nI tried to use the desert theme without making it look too much like Buck Nasty's drought...but I guess I failed there :\\\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nSintax Error - Point counter - used with permission from FAJ\r\nSilentSlayers - Beta testing\r\n\r\nTodo: \r\n\r\nFINAL - Fix neutral capture coding, adjust textures and gameplay if necessary"
