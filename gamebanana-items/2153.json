After seeing how over-complicated this tends to be, I made my own.<br><br>- You can have as many checkpoints as you desire.\r\n<br>- The amount of players is irrelevant.\r\n<br>- Will not glitch.<br><strong><br>USAGE</strong>\r\n<br><br>The left side in the .vmf contains the prefab, while the right is an example of how it can be used. <strong><br><br>1.</strong> Select the triggers called \"reset<em>trigger\", \"checking</em>trigger\" and the amount of 'checkpoints' you intend to use (all along with the filters next to them). Make sure you include the math_counter (called counter) and copy these into your map.<br><br>&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Place the \"reset_triggers\" where the timer starts or where players spawn.<br><strong><br>3.</strong> Place the \"checking_trigger\" where you want to check for how many checkpoints the player has reached.\r\n<br><br><strong>4.</strong> Place the smaller (checkpoints) triggers you want the player to reach before advancing.\r\n<br><br><strong>5.</strong> Specify the amount of checkpoints you require the player to reach under \"Maximum Legal Value\" in the math_counter.<br><strong><br>6.</strong> Make an \"OnHitMax\" output for what you want to happen when the player reaches this amount of visited checkpoints. If you want them to pass a teleport, push or any other trigger, set their targetname to \"ng0<em>pass\" and put \"anti</em>glitch<em>filter</em>0_passed\" as that triggers filter.<br><br>\r\nI pre-made 20 checkpoints. If you need any more, copy, paste and rename accordingly.<br><br>\r\nHere is a video demonstrating how this is used:<br><br>\r\n<br><br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqq94jif5r8\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br><br>"
