	"_sText": "OK this is the same map as the zh version but with different vehicle and customized to meet the zombie mod requirements, in this map you will drive a BIG car, yes a BIG car with a closable door and windows! The mission is to get as many uninfected humans safely inside the vehicle and shut lock the door so zombies cant get in LOL. Once done that you can open the windows and shoot at crossing zombies while someone is driving over them! But be aware that standing to close to the window is dangerous and will be easier for outside zombies to infect you and eat your brain LOL! Enjoy have fun and donâ€™t forget to rate me."
