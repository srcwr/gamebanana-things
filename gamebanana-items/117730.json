	"_sText": "*UPDATED* Map has been tweaked somewhat, being that the wall has been moved in to close the open space of the floor somewhat.  And with testing the map with a full 19 bots, it was definitely a framerate improvement over the slightly expanded version.\r\n\r\nI saw fit to do so since this map has strayed somewhat from the original feel I was going for.  There is still the much more detailed version out there, but this particular version needed to run as smooth as it can be.\r\n\r\nAfter the map had started to chug along with twenty people, I could maybe push for 24, but 32 just seems unreasonable and a pure slaughterfest.  It'll stay 20 people only.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAn alternate version of my FY_Waterwold_v1 map.  Currently having issue's with optimizing that map so I decided to make an alternate map set in a VR situation.  I've always liked maps like this.\r\n\r\nThis version is simpler and lacking water, but should be less taxing on systems being that the map has been simplified.\r\n\r\nFits up to twenty players.\r\n\r\nNo bot nav available.\r\n\r\nMap is untested with other players, but should be fine."
