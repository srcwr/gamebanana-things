	"_sText": "Hello everyone, this is my re-release of my most recently created map gg_fallout_camp. After reading reviews and play testing the map i made some needed changes to make it a little more enjoyable.\r\n\r\n1) I fixed all noted texture errors. i made the wood boards more realistic, fixed the crates to all face outwards, and evened a few uneven textures here and there.\r\n\r\n2) The wooden boards no longer hover in the air lol. i Wanted to keep them textured as wood so people would be more likely to shoot and break them.\r\n\r\n3) Most importantly i added lights to the bottom floor. it is now well lit and more enjoyable to play in. thanks to the bucket for the advice!\r\n\r\nJust to let you all know, the hole in the bottom center teleports you to the 2 platforms on the upper level depending on which side you jump in. I hope you all have lots of fun playing the map. all feedback is welcome ^_^\r\n\r\nP.S: i plan on releasing a second version of this map soon. It will be just the top floor for anybody who does not want the bottom bunker. "
