Although the subterranean bunker layout is almost exactly the same as the real bunker, for better game play I took the liberty (pun intended) of adding more hallways, doors and vents to open up the layout from having a single choke point.  This is the “last stand” bunker from Berlin, Germany. \r\n\r\n-\t52 Spawn points, 26 per side\r\n-\tBuy Zones\r\n-\tOptimized with no draw, hint and skip for better FPS\r\n-\t3d Skybox\r\n-\tCube maps\r\n-\tNav File for bots\r\n\r\nBlair (Bobpoblo) Burkhardt – Level Design\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/members/776402\r\n"
