	"_sText": "**AIM_KARGO** BY UNREAL\r\n\r\nDesigned for competitive gaming, the map is result of a strong desire to create an interactive environment for the player, where players are not only making a difference. Offering a reasonable level of detail, cranes carry bulky items that can make a difference during a round, they will cross between the player and his target adding an extra factor to the game. That is what the map focuses on, and its something that I love to do.\r\nCreated for the mappingbase.de mapping contest sponsored by BFHosting.com and ESL.eu.\r\n\r\n_Sorry! The screenshots don't show some of the detail, due to being overlays and they don't appear because I was using a CFG._\r\n\r\nThis is the second time I do this kind of map, the first one being [awp_station](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/152741 \"awp_station\").\r\n\r\n<dt>**Map features:**</dt>\r\n<dd>\r\n\r\n- Lightning\r\n- Interectative environment\r\n- Custom radar\r\n- Wallbangs possible\r\n- Custom textures\r\n- 64 Spawnpoints\r\n- Custom precipitation particles\r\n- ESL / BFHosting / MappingBase adverts (required for the contest)\r\n- Many others!</dd>\r\n\r\nI couldn't decide whether to leave it as an AIM map or AWP map, so I made two versions for people who don't prefer one to other as well.\r\n\r\nI wanna thank everyone who suported me on this project and mappingbase for hosting this contest.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on running this map on a Deathmatch server, please consider having the AWP version rather then the AIM version as its cleaner (no droped weapons).\r\n\r\nFeel free to download, comment & rate the map.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
