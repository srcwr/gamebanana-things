Well I decided to do just that.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Three comets that revolve around the arena\r\n- The arena is located on a comet\r\n- Air vents that push you upwards\r\n- Nice skybox\r\n- Removed the spawns near the doors that let people shoot someone right when the round begins\r\n- Kept the small filesize (2.53 MB)\r\n- Included a res file for the banner, all you have to do is edit the res to make your banner show instead\r\n- Skybox texture packed in the BSP so you don't have to worry about a RES file for that\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nBadMofo and Mitchard for supporting me and uploading the map to our server :D\r\n\r\nTREXiL for testing it out for me and taking numerous screenshots! Big thanks to you buddy.\r\n\r\nMy video card is shot right now, so if you find any bugs report them to me please, and suggestions are ALWAYS welcome!\r\n\r\nXfire = Mitsudigi"
