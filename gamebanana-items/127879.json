	"_sText": "Basically, there is one T that has a bunch of buttons infront of him. Each button makes a small spike go down killing any CTs in the way. Every 8 seconds, all the CTs will rise up through pipes on small platforms. Once the platforms goes up and back down, the CT will be able to choose a different hole. If any CTs survive for 5 rounds, both the T and CTs will get teleported to a long grass area with a bunch of boxes. The T has a scout on one end and the CTs have to run to the T end to press a button that kills the T (kinda like mg_backalley_run)."
