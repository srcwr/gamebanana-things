I still need to fix some bugs for the final. Also I would love to have any constructive feedback so I can make the final better.\r\n\r\nBug and todo list:\r\n- Some reflection errors (if anyone know how to fix them then can you say)\r\n- Some better brushwork in areas. \r\n- Some better detail and more detailed smaller brushwork.\r\n- Maybe some more better hiding areas in the big storage room.\r\n- Some different sorts of zombie mod gameplay within the map.\r\n\r\nThanks, drimp\r\n\r\nNote: Please tell me if you add it to a server\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/0HSHUxA1k4U&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/0HSHUxA1k4U&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>"
