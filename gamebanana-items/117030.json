	"_sText": "Hello all, this is my first upload on here since about a year ago. This map is a regular CS:S deathmatch course. It is symetrical for t's and ct's so there is no real advantage for either... at the center of the course is the mausoleum, there are two doors, one for each team, hit \"use\" to open the door. A flashlight is recommended for inside the laberynth style mausoleum, as it is entirely dark, adding to the experience of the course. A flashlight is not required for the outdoors however. The outdoors consists of the two starting graveyards, and the two paths around the mausoleum. One side is an extended graveyard. Tombstones and rocks may provide cover. the other side is a spooky forest. both sides are divided by a river, one side has a bridge, but the other does not. Fun for teams of all sizes, please Download and tell me what you think! :)"
