	"_sText": "Heres a simple BT telephone booth prefab. Ive left it as a map file so you can just copy and paste it across. Ive included all the custom gfx files, instructions in the readme.  The door is attatched I just did that for the screenshot. Use the texture, alter the vmts etc as you see fit, whatever. Id like to see it in a map, so please give me a shout if you use it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change anything then just ungroup it. Everything save for the top and back are func_detail. You can however shoot through it, I have no idea why, but if you can solve this then go ahead.\r\n\r\nSET TEXTURE LOCK ON WHEN COPYING AND MOVING!!!"
