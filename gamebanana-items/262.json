The meaning with this is, that you can use it to very small matches, maybe against bots if you are borred. If there is ANY bugs found in this map, please contact me, I'm new to this, so please dont startup with that it is ugly and sh*t like that. \r\n\r\nBut, you are welcome to tell me what can be fixed, or what I can add or do better to next version of De-Pyramid\r\n\r\nDe-Pyramid is inspirated by a map i saw in CS:CZ\r\n\r\n(Sry for my english, I'm not that good)"
