Unfortunately i haven't had a chance to play it (in halo 3) so i had to build it based on a few pics... but i took some artistic liberty and made a pretty fun frantic little map out of it.\r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b><br />\r\n40 spawns, buyzones, almost all custom textures, some brush-based props, a few traps, animated brushwork, ext ext\r\n\r\n<br />Please visit <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/studios/2377\">Clan 5k3's studio</a> for more Halo css maps and materials."
