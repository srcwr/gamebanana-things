	"_sText": "This map was created originally as a part of the 2007 Joe.to Halloween Map Pack:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/36702\r\n\r\nIt was an honor to be a part of this map-pack again this year! Last year, my submission for the map-pack was a map called de_nightmare. It was rather well-received, so I wanted to be certain that I did a better job on this one.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat of a re-visioning of de_nightmare, using some ideas that I originally wanted to use for cs_nightmare, but I scrapped that map in favor of this one. This map makes use of some randomly selected \"events\" that are set to occur every round. Each round should be a surprise, and hopefully this will catch people off-guard.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have heard that this map may cause server crashes when there are 20 or more people in the server. If you receive ANY major server crashes, I would really like to know. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThere's much more information in the actual readme file, so enjoy!\r\n"
