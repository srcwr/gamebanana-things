I know there are many errors in the console, Ignore these as It's the Source engine itself, not the map. The map works completely fine, and is working like it should. Note this was upgraded from a beta version of the map, and has a new layout and much more new content, including custom content. \r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n\r\nFriends and family\r\nverballydecapitating\r\nMonolix\r\nInterlopers Members\r\nBlink\r\nTurtle-Rock Studios\r\nValve\r\nIwannamap Members\r\nSouleaterQ\r\nUbisoft for a few sounds\r\nCreators of the following texture packs:\r\ncncr04s\r\nphotorealistic"
