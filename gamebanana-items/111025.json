Your mission is to eliminate the Counter-Terrorists (the CHURCH) and by doing so, leave yourselves open to kill Mary when she comes. You must kill ALL the CHURCH members!\r\n\r\nCounter Terrorist (or the CHURCH), you heard about the Demonic Satan Worshipers building a time machine... so you built your own. You are now in Bethlehem and you must eliminate the Demonic Satan Worshipers, and stop them from eliminating Mary and by doing so erasing Jesus from history... (NO there is NOT a Mary in this map!) lol\r\n\r\n<>-<>-<>-<>-<>-<>-<>-< NOTE >-<>-<>-<>-<>-<>-<>-<>\r\n\r\nKEEP AN EYE OUT FOR MY NEW MAP: DE_COLDFIRE WILL BE RELEASED LATE '06 OR VERY EARLY '07.
