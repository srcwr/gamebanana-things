	"_sText": "After a few month's work the map is finally complete! The map has gone through several private alpha and beta tests to make sure there are no gameplay or graphical errors. The map was tested on two servers:\r\n\r\n72.249.10.10:27015\r\n80.190.78.54:27015\r\n\r\nBoth are great servers, so be sure to check them out.\r\n\r\nThe story:\r\n\r\n\"The map will be based in an overgrown, ancient factory. Think of the soft wind rustling through the cracks and holes of a by gone time. With the eerie silence that completely surrounds you, a chill runs down your spine. What happened here to make the inhabitance leave in such a hurry? What would make them abandon this place completely?\"\r\n\r\nThe map is made for servers with about 25-32 slots. The map is still playable with less people, but since the map is large, the action will be less centralized. I will release a smaller version in a week's time.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-High FPS (80-100).\r\n-Graphics that show ZM map don't have to full bright and ugly, but has teh gameplay that makes ZM fun.\r\n-Barricading and camping.\r\n-Throughly tested for game-breaking bugs\r\n-HDR\r\n-Large, detailed environment that will draw you into the game.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n-Caid for two of the smaller areas for me to detail. (Good job on them, but work on keeping it on grid :P).\r\n-Games and Error.ocx;s servers for the private testing.\r\n-Der.Zoomer for finding bugs that I didn't even know could exist.\r\n-And everybody else who encouraged me!\r\n\r\nThanks, and happy hunting!"
