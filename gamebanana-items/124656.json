	"_sText": "My first map, decided to theme it around League of Legends.&nbsp; <br><br>Intended for auto but possible on all styles (there are slow skip routes for the last 2 parts). Gameplay is a fluid spreedrun from start to finish with many major inbuilt skips and I'm estimating global to be around the 3 minute mark. Difficulty is about a hard T5 otherwise using the skip routes I'd say a T3 (rating out of 6 tiers). I still wanted to add more to this map (Elo hell stage , more interesting alternate skip routes, seperate master / challenger stages etc.) however I've reached the brushlimit. Porting this map was much easier than I thought it would be which is why I did it when I said I wouldn't anytime soon (http://gamebanana.com/maps/192355). The 2nd part of the diamond stage may be a little confusing on where to go the first time round, so here's a quickly thrown together video on how to do it: https://youtu.be/SQQWKo6Jtbw <br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks to Biql, Roger, and Saving Private Pyle for helping me when I got stuck with hammer issues. Thanks to TopHattWaffle and Saspatoon for their texture packs, used it for about 80% of my map. \r\n<br><br>Finally thanks to xXLoliMaster69 for playtesting / giving feedback on the global route<br><br>Good Luck Have fun.<br><br><br> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCC92u-uXHw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
