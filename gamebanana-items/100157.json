You start out as a ct and make your way from the troll room to the pillar room to the giant stair place. T's are placed in various places to try to shoot you. There is a buyzone. I made it so everyone starts out with deagles and shotties. So that is what the bots will shoot you with. Once you get to the end of the map I made it so the round will start over no matter what. As soon as you take five steps away from the far end of the bridge... rounds over. Hope you like the map. "
