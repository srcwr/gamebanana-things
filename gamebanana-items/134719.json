However, I hope to distribute them soon and see what you all think. Just let me know good or bad.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are 28 spawnpoints, and no I didn't put that many on a small map because I'm new at mapping. I did it because a lot of servers maxplayers are anywhere from 24 - 32.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to leave a comments, stamps, and ratings.\r\n\r\nFatGuyLaughing\r\n\r\nA.K.A. Fatty"
