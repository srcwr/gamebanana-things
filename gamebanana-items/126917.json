To play this map your server should have sv_airaccelarate set to \"150\" or more and phys_timescale to atleast \"1.5\".\r\nIt has some \"secrets\" that are easy to reach and wont affect the gameplay much. I hope its fun to play this map and I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>\r\n<b>30+ TRAPS</b></legend>23 CONTROLED TRAPS\r\n7+ NON-CONTROLED</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<b>AT THE END</b>\r\nAt the end if a CT or more survive they can select one of three optional levels:\r\n\r\n<b>M3</b> - both teams run/jump to the middle, catch the m3 and kill the oposite team.\r\n<b>TMP</b> - CTs spawn with a TMP and Ts with a knife each. The goal is to kill the oposite team aswell.\r\n<b>HEGrenade</b> - CTs have 3 grenades to kill the T team and if they fail they can still break the glass kill them or be killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to receive good and constructive feedback so I can improve this map. If you find any bug please let me know. <b> ALSO</b> let me know if you make itension of running this map on a server!\r\n\r\nHAVE FUN\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
