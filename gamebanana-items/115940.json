It's from counter-strike 1.6 and i thought i would make it for Counter Strike: Source.\r\nStart of round, shoot the glass under the players and fall down the map to land on many square that will teleport you\r\nto a ledge with weapons on them. last man standing wins the round for their team.\r\nThis is one the first version and i will think of ways to improve it.\r\n\r\nThanks, Slippers"
