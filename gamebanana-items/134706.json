	"_sText": "This map origonaly started with the need for new maps in the clan Exiled gg/dm server. You can find the server at this IP: 69.90.119.135:27015\r\n\r\nThe map was drawn out by Killer, one of the leaders of the clan, and the drawn version of the map was given to me. I worked for about 2 days (total of about 23 hours) on this map. It took several compiles to get the lighting just perfect to work with the map how I needed it to. It's made so that it is a little dark, very bright in the buildings, and you can't see much of the sky. It's suppose to look like you're in a huge canyon sorta place. I thought I portrayed this canyon look fairly well. \r\n\r\nThe map includes about 100 spawn points (although I wouldn't recomend using that many people for this map), by zones, several places to go, and well organized boxes in the inside of the buildings for strategy.\r\n\r\nI made this map for the Exiled clan's server, but once it was done and everyone liked it, I decided I'd post it up on here. If you'd like to learn more about clan Exiled, visit our website at www.exiledclan-home.com. Or visit us in one of our many servers, you can get information about the servers at the website as well."
