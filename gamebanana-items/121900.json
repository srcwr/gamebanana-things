	"_sText": "Hi, thanks for checking out this map. This is a new style of surfing. The job of the terrorists is to surf their parts and camp the hostages at the end of each stage. The job of the counter-terrorists is to get to the end of each stage and rescue the hostages. There are four hostages, one per stage. The higher number of the stage, the better weapon you can choose from at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n~have fun playing it!"
