	"_sText": "This map can be played as zombie or regular, however regular gameplay may seem somewhat repetative. The main feature is the highrise office with all floors accessable. It was a drawn out project so the map may be inconsistent. I'm very happy with the way lighting appears in the warehouse, but most other lighting was annoying and again, last minute.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of gameplay design on the office building, as well as a lot of invisible walls to stop exploiting. One secret area. Smoke effects may slow low end PCs. Nav included.\r\n\r\nThis map has not yet been used on a zombie server yet (soon to come to a server). If you want to use it, feel free! :D\r\n\r\nMore screenshots have been added due to suggestion :p"
