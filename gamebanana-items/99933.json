	"_sText": "Here's the final version of my map, originally called \"cs_atlas\". I'm calling it 'final' because I'm trying to move on to other projects...\r\n\r\nThe map was made with lower-end computers in mind, so some of the geometry and prop placement is a bit sparse, and there is no HDR support.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 40 spawnpoints in the map, to help support servers with higher player counts. However, it seems to play best with around 16 players. \r\n\r\nI also included a version of the map with no buyzones or hostages, suitable for GG or CSDM. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT** \r\nI had to fix an issue with some of the physics objects in the map. I've renamed the updated map \"cs_gentech_final\"."
