	"_sText": "Cs_eglan_final is created by Robin Brummans (Hamster) and Rutger Wink.\r\nI did the brushwork, Rutger Wink made the textures.\r\n\r\nWe made the map for a Lan-party on our school.\r\nOn the Lan-party itself, the map was a succes. Many people liked it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the map:\r\ncs_eglan is based on a shopping mall near the school. \r\nIt is a pretty simple map, but you can go many way's as either a Terrorist or a Counterterrorist.\r\nthere are 2 ''long'' streets. 1 is good for sniping, the other one is good for closer combat.\r\nThere is a garage, and a tunnel system..\r\nI get with my pc (7600gt, 2gb memory, 3200+) 60fps on the map. I have no FPS drops.\r\n\r\nThe map is 20mb big, including custom textures.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- There are still some things that aren't very good, but we only had 3 weeks to make the map from scratch.\r\n- This is the first time that I create a ''realistic'' map. Please provide constructive feedback!.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it.\r\nHamster out.\r\n\r\nNotice the feedback instructions.\r\nI thank Chizbone for improving the .Nav file."
