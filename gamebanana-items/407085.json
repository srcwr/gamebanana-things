	"_sText": "I created this version of kabul2 because the old one was too classic, so i had to change a lot in this version. My new version take place in kabul but from what you can observe, i added some grass and bricks. Our old world was built on bricks, and this year rained a lot in the desertified areas.<br><br>In kabul2_2022 you can find a new bombsite B that CT must protect very good from the T. The T team has a fast route so they have the posibility to plant fast. In kabul2_2022 i canceled the tower that goes to the mid because from my POV it was never a good spot, maybe for campers.<br><br>This map i think has a better acesibility for the both teams and kinda balanced.<br><br>As a final word, i hope that this version will be your favorite for a long time. If you downloaded this version and you liked it, please leave a feedback. Perhaps someone will find some bugs or glitches that may need my attention.<br><br>Have fun everybody!"
