	"_sText": "Author: Titan1x77\r\n\r\nName: de_weir_beta\r\n\r\nRelease notes: This version is close to final in terms of gameplay, seems well balanced. The Beta will be ran for balance issues for a couple of months. Cosmetic touch ups and any balance changes will be made for the final version, along with any bug fixes.\r\n\r\nType: Bomb/Diffuse; 50 spawns, 12v12 is ideal for this map.\r\n\r\nDescription: Small intense map with quick routes to sites, with an outer area to take a long way around to Bombsite B (also branches off to A a few times). Bombsite A is more open but has a lower area underground to help cover it. Access to high vantage points everywhere and a few small areas with vent access too! \r\n\r\nBuild notes: 2 weeks, first time using Hammer (so it's my first map), learned a lot while making this level, and enjoyed doing so. Concentrated on gameplay/balance more then looks, wanted to keep framerate as high as possible for an large outdoor area map.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"
