In this map, there are 6 layers \r\nand a giant ladder connecting all of them in the center. \r\nIn each layer, there is 1 terrorist that \r\nspawns inside the room and 4 counter-terrorists that \r\nspawn on 4 different sides outside of the room. The trick \r\nis, the terrorists get a machine gun, smoke grenade, \r\nflash grenade, and he grenade, while counter-terrorists \r\nhave to take out the T's with only knives and pistols. T's, defend your \r\nroom or climb up or down the ladder to help another T. \r\nCt's, eliminate the terrorist using skills and tactics and then go \r\nto the other layers to kill all the other T's to win the \r\ngame. Small map, fun for 10-20 mins."
