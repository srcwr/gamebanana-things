In my opinion it looks like some sort of playground, but really if I had done it with proper textures it would look like some sort of processing facility or old fashioned mill. \r\nThe layout is fair and fun, allowing the player to quickly change their route and situation. The only real dead end is the sniper tower. The area beyond the walls is out of play. The water wheels are rotating and deliver 1dmg per frame if blocked, however they are almost entirely player clipped. \r\nThanks to:\r\n[LL] Chase for the water wheel idea\r\n[LL] Lord Azael for support/ideas/testing/uploading\r\n[LL] Sibby for feedback/ideas\r\nAll of [LL] for support and testing!\r\nAnyone else that was involved in the public test and gave me feedback\r\n\r\n*Please visit the clan website www.llamalords.co.uk\r\n*We are not recruiting at the moment, however social and regular server players are usually welcome *to join!\r\n*This map can be uploaded to other download portals if needs be, but distrubute with the custom nav file and this readme please.\r\n*Ask my permission before editing or decompiling the map.\r\n*Steam Friends: explosivose\r\n\r\nLL ftw ^_^"
