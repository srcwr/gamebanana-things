Since then my mapping skills have vastly improved and after promising another version in the old description and seeing TopHATTwaffle's new CTF prefab I saw it fit to set about making the new version.\r\n\r\nThis new version has much higher FPS, better lighting, skybox, texturing, displacements and a far improved CTF tool built in, instead of having to be downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe original map (That's the very first version my old one was based on) came from the console version of 007 Nightfire<sup>TM</sup> which coincidently was given to me by my beta tester, PowPew :). If you haven't already played Nightfire, I highly recommend you do, it's great little vintage gem that plays rather well. This remake does differ a bit from the original, but the principals and design are practically the same.\r\n___________________________________\r\n\r\n<b class= \"red\">NOTE:<br>\r\nIf your are unable to cap the flag your own, try dropping the flag and picking it up again, usually works for me :).</b><br>\r\n___________________________________<br>\r\n<h2>A few Features of this map:</h2><b>+Constant, high FPS<br>\r\n+HDR<br>\r\n+64 Spawns<br>\r\n+Large outdoor areas, great for sniping<br>\r\n+Moving gondolas and outside routes for a more stealthy attack. <br>\r\n___________________________________<br>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.game-monitor.com/search.php?search=ctf_skyrail&type=map\">Servers which might be running this map</a></strong></center>"
