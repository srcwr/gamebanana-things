	"_sText": "This is my first map hope you enjoy killing on it, I enjoyed creating it. A recreation of CoD's harbor map eastern side with some of my own design elements, though I stayed pretty true to the original design. There are 8 spawn points 4 for ct's and 4 for t's if you think it needs more let me know. It has been play tested and I think everything was fixed. The bucket makes a glass sound when shot if you know how to fix it let me know. Lots of thanks go out ot everyone posting tutorials through FPSBANANA, they were alot of help learning Hammer. Thanks also goes out to Infinity Ward for creating CoD and the original harbor map, and more thnaks to Valve corp for making an incredible game.    "
