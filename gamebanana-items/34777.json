Except other it was necessary to consider features still author's Map Mutation system (depending on the number of CTs paths are opened or closed).\r\n\r\nWell... in any case bots play now better than before (imho). Look and compare!\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map author available to loading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/154077).\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Garten (for very curious experimental map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nAlways will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks. Play and Enjoy!"
