	"_sText": "Seven story building. \r\nCurrently there is one bomb site on which is located on the roof.\r\nThere are a couple ways to get to the roof for both teams.\r\nAll ladders work (even on the dumpster and the portable one) and all doors work. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-  This is obviously my first map. Not just my first CS:S map, but my first map ever.\r\n-  Bots don't do very well inside the building, I haven't worked on their paths at all.\r\n-  This beta is mostly for layout and I welcome all useful comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I am planning on changing:\r\n-  The C4 explosion kills you just about everywhere\r\n-  Lighting and details (different textures, objects, etc...)\r\n-  Change bounding box into a more realistic environment\r\n-  Change most wooden crates into other objects (cars, trees, etc...)\r\n-  Make a small building out of the two-walled sector near T spawn\r\n-  Detail the insides of the rooms\r\n-  Possibly spread out the spawns so they are farther from the objective building\r\n-  Maybe a basement with a bombsite and a couple different entrances"
