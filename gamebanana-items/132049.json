It's my first map, cut me a little bit of slack.\r\n\r\nAnyways, this map's theme is that there is no cading (barricading) whatsoever, no physics objects other than a few HE grenades. This map requires a LOT of teamwork, otherwise you get your ass kicked. This map works BEST with\r\n1. NOT infinite ammo\r\n2. Zombies with a lot of health\r\n3. NO warcraft mod\r\n4. Normal jump/gravity\r\n5. Fullhouse\r\n6. Zombies respawn again as zombies\r\n\r\nEverything in this map is totally original except for red crate and overturned white truck. Others can use my ideas as their own, but PLZ don't VMEX my map and claim it as your own.\r\nMy philosophy is that humans should ALWAYS lose. If the zombies aren't stupid or noobish, they should be able to have everyone dead.\r\n\r\nThis map also functions as a bombing map. A is in the Concrete Barrier Room, B is in the Overturned Truck Room."
