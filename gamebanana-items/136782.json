(I had to add some extra cover for the sake of balance.)\r\n\r\nThe map features:\r\n-Buyzones \r\n-HDR \r\n-60 spawn points\r\n\r\nHave fun stalker.\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\n------------------------\r\n- Removed 6 lights and rearranged the other 6 (See last screen shot.)\r\n- Aligned some textures (They wont stay in position when I move brushes around.)\r\n\r\nThe bsp has the same name because when I saved it as gg_stalker_arena_1.1 it couldn't generate a new .BSP it just said \"Could not find specified path\" for something like that when compiling."
