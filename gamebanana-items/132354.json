	"_sText": "I made a zombie survival, though I have put a bombsite in the middle of the top-floor for a normal match.\r\n\r\nI also put 4 shotguns in each spawn area, because this is a small closed in match which makes shotguns great for close quarter combat! The top floor is really bright while the ground floor is dark. It's really fun to set it so bots can only use knives and watch them run around, as it turns into a giant knife-fest. Usually the bots don't go to the top floor, but this is 'cos they kill everyone downstairs first, but i expect with real people this will not happen."
