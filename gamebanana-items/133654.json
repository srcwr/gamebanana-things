	"_sText": "Only my second real map I have ever created from the ground up and released. This is also my first GunGame map. It's kind of like an fy, fun times, blue arena mix of a map with it's only style. I put a bit of work into it to hopefully be visually appealing as well. Optimization was also done to hopefully achieve the best FPS possible.\r\n\r\nFinally this map is dedicated to the Aura clan and those that still play. Even though some have changed tags and others have moved to different games the community will continue on. The map is also dedicated to my three favorite GG communities which are \"Relaxed and Chill\" \"Never Stop Gaming\" and \"Casual Mature Gamers\".\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for all the fun."
