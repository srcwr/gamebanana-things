	"_sText": "This is my first mg-map ever built, and my second map of all...\r\nSo don't be too harsh on your judgement..\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nCT's and T's spawn on the opposite sides of eachother and need to find a way to kill the other team, whilst balancing in the air.\r\n\r\nThis can be done with the standard knife, or you could take a risk and try to get to a higher level for a grenade. With a little more endurance you can get an awp at the top of the level.\r\n\r\nFor those who fail in balancing... The game is not over yet!\r\nYou can still destroy the poles on which the platforms balance, aswell as the poles of the entire structure where the awp and grenades are on.\r\n\r\nAlso you could climb back up at one of the scaffoldings to give it another try!\r\n\r\nWhile playing the map, be sure not to end up like a squashed potato by one of the platforms!\r\n\r\n***UPDATE***\r\n\r\nListened to the feedback and made the scaffoldings solid. Meaning you can't slip off them anymore, though I liked the fact that the planks were movable. \r\n(Didn't make them ladders because the theme of the '3D-skybox' is scaffoldings aswell..)\r\n\r\nAlso I've added a lot more spawnpoints like Paul_Deagle suggested me, it supports up to 32 players now. It just fits in the map :P\r\nThanks to those who gave feedback and enjoy!"
