	"_sText": "This is the first map I've bothered publish here. It was made by me and Peach one evening, and altogether took about 6 hours, though most of that was texturing and lighting. \n\nThe map itself features a T and CT maze, which they spawn in and must escape from. The players that escape quickest get to the high ground, and have the best attacking point. The gameplay of it isnt brilliant, but its a nice fun map to play, and is great with bots.\n\nIt also features custom decals made by me, and a custom skybox (credits to Karatekaefer). Peach is a new mapper, while I am fairly experienced, so she made the basic map structure, while I added all the fancy lighting and stuff :D\n\nTo install, just unzip to your cstrike folder!\n\nEnjoy!"
