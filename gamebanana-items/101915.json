	"_sText": "Making this map was a real challenge, since Ace and myself are on Linux. We made this map only using this operation system and using Hammer through Wine.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This maps is a complex bomb scenario map intended to offers a different gameplay from the official ones. Indeed, this map is not as open as the official ones but there are a lot more possibilities. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>In this map the layout will be generated randomly on each round in order to offer a more complex and original gameplay. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>On the graphic side, this map was inspired by old school brush-work level-design such as Half Life. And we have put a particular attention to the optimization, thus this map can be played on a very low end computer with decent frame-rates.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Also a hand-made Navigation-Mesh is included in order to play with bots !\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you want to contact us in order to get the .vmf for educational or remix purposes you can check our E-M@ils in the .txt contained in the archive !"
