	"_sText": "This is my first official beta for cs_little_forest. With this being the first beta I need to know what I can do to improve this map. There is a lot of work to be done on this, but I need to know what you guys think since you will be the ones playing on the map. :]\r\nSo far the map features:\r\n-Lots of ambient sounds\r\n-Lots of cover\r\n-Foliage\r\n-Buy zones for each side\r\n-Lake with fish\r\n-Steam coming from the water\r\n-The world is cold so players will see each others breath\r\n-Wind\r\n\r\nStill adding:\r\n-More to the design/layout\r\n-HDR (when I have the map 100% complete)\r\n-Optimization\r\n-More displacements\r\n-More lakes and paths\r\n-Looking to add cliffs\r\n\r\nThis takes place in an early morning battle, birds will chirps, frogs will croak, steam rises from the water. Players will see each other breath, after all it is fall and it's cold. :] \r\nI'm hoping the map gives some environmental vibes off to the players. Please keep in mind this is my first beta, so this <b>in not the final product!</b>\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, feedback, or ideas are welcome, but please don't rate this map a 4 then give no reason. I <b>need</b> your feed back to improve this map to a proper release! I thank you all for taking a look at my map, and those of you who take the time to help me out with it give feed back and ideas. \r\n\r\nEnjoy b1, and look for my full release to come out soon, I hope.\r\n\r\n-tpskjarhead"
