In the middle of the map, there is a UMP machine pistol which can be the decisive element over win or lose.\r\n\r\nA good movement can bring you big advantages over your opponent! Many spots can be reached with trickjumps more effectifely than with the normal walk-way.\r\nThe map contains one nice secret.\r\n\r\nThanks to the testplayers\r\n\r\n- Goldknight\r\n- TomahawxX\r\n- CmP\r\n- michael\r\n- Bighomer"
