	"_sText": "Im proud of this project and getting a lot of great feedback from others. \r\nI wanted to add so much more but i couldnt cause i maxed out the max_planes. I just couldnt fit anymore in there. Well, my passion for interior remodeling inspired this  messy remodel. Ive seen many rat maps out there that are finished nice bathrooms but never one under construction. Its pretty medium sized and great for gungame believe it or not. I will be making this a de_map but first I want to get this out there as a gg for navigation and bombsite locations. This map is best played with a server script that randomly places the player_spawns but the map originaly has 12cts on the wet saw and window side and 12 t's by the craftsman tool box and contractors binder. every texture, tool, product, shape or any thing is originaly designed and created custom by me. uhhhh, credit Valve for the wall and hardibacker looking texture and thats it. the rest is me. lots of work. 6 full days on this. 6am-1am everyday!\r\n\r\nHail Hammer!"
