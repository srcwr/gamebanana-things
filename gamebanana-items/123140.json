I would have not made this map unless if it weren't for Paper-cut. So, you can either blame him or thank him for this clean 3rd version.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering \"Why the name thrill3r?\" \r\nWell...Someone had already posted their own version of my thriller and had named it \"surf_thriller3.\" So, I was kinda left with no choice but to name it surf_thrill3r, with a 3.\r\n\r\nThis map contains...\r\n- Guns: m3, p90, ak47, m4a1, m429, awp, and nades (but they aren't guns).\r\n- A buyzone in the secret room at the end.\r\n- An internal jail release system (transferred over from the older versions).\r\n- A room with one way glass in jail for those who know the secret code.\r\n\r\nThis map will be on the cycle at my server @ css.nyfiber.net:30000\r\nJoin my Steam Group @ http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bucknastysurf for map betas and other stuff.\r\n\r\n- I endorse this 3rd version and only this 3rd version.\r\n\r\n-- Buck Nasty\r\n\r\nhttp://waspnest.net/\r\nhttp://solidsurf.info/</font>"
