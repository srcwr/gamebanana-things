	"_sText": "Hello and welcome to my best island level yet! It's very much like Battle Field 2, in that it has various areas on the map to take over and that it's nice and sunny. Choose your class at the beginning and take over the checkpoints. Get near the large metal pole in the enemy's base to win. Bots have great trouble on this map (In that it takes about 3 hours to generate the nav file and still doesn't seem to have an end). If somebody could generate the bot code I would be VERY greatful and you can have your name in the credits.\r\n\r\nIt needs the correct server cfg to work, hopefully a massive 32 man server could host this some day, though I doubt something this radical would work on a large scale. There is a drivable vehicle, though it's very basic.\r\n\r\nHave fun climbing the massive mountain. It doesn't look big until you get to the top ;). A nice little bit of exercise for any explorers out there.\r\n\r\nIf you like this map then say, I'll make more maps like that then eventually I'll have enough to make a mod for css.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, hopefully the map's fun ;)\r\n\r\nIt is actually V0_5c, but I doubt I'll add any more to it."
