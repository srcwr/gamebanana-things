	"_sText": "Gg_roman_ggn_v2\r\nThe aim of this map was to create a very lifelike map, while retaining the fun of a gungame.\r\nFeatures a large parthenon like building with intricate architecture. There are several ramps on each corner of the building that allows access to the top of the building. There is no current 3D skybox, in a future version i may include one. Last Screenshot thanks to FragForschung, its nice to see a map final put to use. Ty\r\n========\r\nPlease do not edit or include this in a pack without the permission of either cheebs or I.\r\n========\r\nPlease comment and assess, seriously. \r\n========\r\nUpdates: \r\nReplaced random lighting inside with torches.\r\nRemoved unnecessary blocks, to increase fps.\r\nAdded obelisk like structures at corners of the map.\r\nAdded a 3D skybox!\r\n========\r\nThis is the final version. Thx to Fragforschung for testing and cheebs for texturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
