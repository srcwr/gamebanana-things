	"_sText": "This is a map I created for one of my clan servers.\r\n\r\nIt is a new style called Medieval Jousting, in which both teams slide across each side trying to shoot each other with weapons you jump into at spawn. Using unlimited grenades can increase fun and excitement.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended the server use NoBlock, because when players reach the end, they teleport back to spawn and re-slide. Although you can control the speed you slide, by holding forwards or backwards.\r\n\r\nA lot of people that have played the map find it very fun and think it is good for practicing against moving targets, increasing the skill of their aim.\r\n\r\nHere is a video to the map in action:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xTHvggodw\r\n\r\nwww.theforce2.com"
