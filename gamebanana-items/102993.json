Original idea, map, displacements, texture blending, and the bridge are all done by Lost!I just made it a funcional DE map, added some brushwork and made it bigger. I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis map uses HDR, has built cubemaps, and has a couple of small graphical bugs. It is small/medium sized, and probably works best with 6-8 players per team. I have included 16 spawn points per team. "
