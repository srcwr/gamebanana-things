	"_sText": "A new Christmas map by me for the third year running, with a bonus made by <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/members/1749490\">bhopshawty</a>.<br><br>Wish I had more time, lots of things that were placeholders never got changed.<br><br>Hope you enjoy nonetheless.<br><br>P.S. The ice seems to not work as well on higher ping, sorry.<br><br>Edit: Reupload bsp cause bonus end mod zone was accidentally labelled as start so fixed that. Since it's less than a day later I didn't rename the bsp. It's always something eh? Also made bonus song loop quicker as was intended.<br><br>"
