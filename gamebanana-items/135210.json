On the Church Tower i have put a HE give Weapon Box (Place Fixed). The Map is a Fantasy Church Map. May be all 20 sec. hit a Thunder Light into the Tower Cross. Now you can go trouth the Back Side of the Church (Faster Gameplay) I have add Ambient Sounds for the Generator, Thunder and the Wind. I think the Map is good for Gun Game. I have put 32 Player Spawns. There are some new Textures (Main Church, Tunnel,Decals) and some new Prop Statics and Physics (Plant Pot's, Generator, 2 Gas Canister, 2 Oil Borelis, Cables. The Light Problem in the Tunnel is Fixed.
