	"_sText": "My 2nd map, this  map was designed for sniper wars. It has a 2 level war zone to keep things interesting. The top zone is connected by a single bridge in the middle, and both sides have good cover (which means one side has to rush and overpower the other or it becomes a sniper war). The lower area is a darker zone, with access to both the top level and the ground. Each side has many good sniper spots, shotty spots, and even a few spots that are best used with a SMG.\r\n\r\nAt a glance:\r\n\r\n40 spawn points in all, 20 per side\r\nnav pack included\r\nvery fun \r\nsniper/gg/dm friendly\r\ngood lighting (env and spot)\r\nbest for teamplay, but random battles are effective too\r\nfull buyzones\r\nskybox\r\n\r\n----------(>_<)----------\r\n\r\nUPDATED: same map, some minor fixes + props"
