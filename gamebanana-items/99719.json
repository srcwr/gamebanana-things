	"_sText": "<b>Map Description</b>\r\nThis map is located in the frozen lands of northern Russia. An old research facility has been repurposed for a secret missile complex. Scientists have been taken hostage and forced to assemble warheads for a rogue terrorist force. Counter terrorists have been sent out to this remote location to eliminate the terrorists and rescue the scientists being held hostage.\r\n\r\n<b>Key Gameplay Description</b>\r\nCs_coldwar is designed to create the fastest most intense gameplay possible.  It takes the Counter-Terrorists less than ten seconds to reach their objective. The Counter-Terrorists need to be especially careful when playing this map as the Terrorists can easily flank the CTâ€™s, cutting them down before they realize what is happening. The enclosed courtyard has multiple access points and is the primary chokepoint of this map. Limited access to the hostages creates a tight defensive position for the Terrorists.\r\n\r\n<b>Key Features</b>\r\n<li>Intense choke point battles\r\n<li>Winter themed Russian military compound"
