	"_sText": "This is somewhat based on the original map gg_watertower, but made entirely from scratch.  There are a lot of differences, too, so I give credit to the original map for inspiration.  The game play is fairly quick, with lighting to signify T vs. CT spawn sides (blue and red), some custom textures (too many different ones to list the authors, but thank you if you know who you are) and some creative assistance by Cyber, an Upper Level Admin of the IBIS Community.  \r\n\r\nThis is designed for GunGame and supports up to 48 players\r\n(24 each side)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!!"
