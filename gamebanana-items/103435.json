	"_sText": "Hello! This is updated version of my map called de_pakkassauna. I wasn't fully satisfied with older version so I decide to make an improved one.\r\nSome changes and features:\r\n\r\n-HDR Lighting effect\r\n\r\n-3D Skybox\r\n\r\n-Improved cliffs\r\n\r\n-New Layout focusing on better gameplay; corridors are bigger to help moving and prevent getting stuck. Less annoying ladders ;) . Terrorists have 2 new routes (basement tunnel and cottage side route). All these changes are made to improve team balance and making games more action-filled and less camping-skilled.\r\n\r\n-Only one bombsite (it says there are A and B but they are next to each other in showerroom and sauna).\r\n\r\n-Custom textures, custom models, more realistic details, environment sounds, working radio...\r\n\r\n-Improved lightning\r\n\r\nServer owners! If you are using older version of de_pakkassauna please replace older with this newer version, much better to play in servers I doubt.\r\nAnd all others if you have downloaded older version and liked it I suggest you to give a try for this too!\r\n\r\nBig thanks to all custom content makers TopHATTwaffle, Klickz72 and Dinus Saurus. You helped me to make this map better :) .\r\nEnjoy or not, and remember to rate and comment!"
