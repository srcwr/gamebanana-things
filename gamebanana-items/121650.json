There is 4 \"main\" ramps that takes you to the side ramps, there is an boost in every main ramp. There four platforms that have teleports, each takes you to the top (Top = over spawns, under jail).\r\n\r\nThere is <b>NO</b> guns anywhere, because this map is designed for DM/Surf server only. Or you can surf it but with knife and pistol only, lol. ;P\r\n\r\nIf you fall off the ramps you're taken to jail, but you can jump out from the jail.\r\n<hr width=100></p>\r\n<p align=center><font size=5 color=blue>Please, assess and comment!!!"
