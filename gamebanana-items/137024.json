	"_sText": "Frustrated with those 99hp hits then dying, leaving a a man standing with 1hp? In this map exiting the spawn could literally mean the difference between 100 and 99hp! This was a relatively quick symmetrical make. It has poor lighting to slightly increase any effectiveness of the boxes as cover. As noted in the screen shots there are drop spots where you can fall and land safely in the water BUT there is also a \"hidden\" button that will permanently take that ability away from you, so be on the lookout!\r\n\r\nNOTE: The ladders inside the tower may be difficult to cooperate with when first using them."
