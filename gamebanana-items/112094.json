In return the road from T to CT spawn is more covered and defensive.\r\n\r\nEye Candy: Nil, i did raise the light map scale to give it some extra. There are lit textures instead of light entities. the hex pits add extra challenge and there are a few jump obstacles that help the game play for sure.\r\n\r\nThis map is full of 'Z' axis game play, plenty of routes, and it damn near feels flow-a-matic.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/projects/view/5406\">Greyfrogs Hexagon Series</a>\r\n"
