While doing so, CT has to overcome many different simple obstacles along their way. There are one checkpoints along the map in which they can regenerate their HP. In addition to this, there are several grenades and an AK-47 for distracting T (or perhaps killing them).\r\n\r\nT\r\n=\r\n\r\nT simply has to kill all CT and prevent them from getting to the finished point. The choice of weapon that T is allowed to have is:\r\n\r\n-  AWP\r\n-  G3GS1\r\n-  SG550\r\n\r\n**Best played with more than 6 people, if there is less than 10 people, there should only be one Terrorist for fair gameplay.**\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qCwhkJ7.png \"\")\r\n\r\nMap designer: TekelaXII\r\n=======================\r\nSkybox texture: Karatekaefer\r\n----------------------------\r\nIdeas: Moozerker\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nDerp off topic:\r\nAfter 2 years, my first upload on Gamebanana never felt nicer."
