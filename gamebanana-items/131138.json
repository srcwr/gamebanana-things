	"_sText": "~~~BREAKFLOORZM~~~\r\nThis map was a request.\r\n\r\nThis is a remake of the popular map \"breakfloor\". Normally, you keep shooting blocks of metal until you fall into a pit to your doom. However, there's been a couple changes to the map for ZM integration. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Retextured, a sort of \"dust\" theme.\r\n- Added a teleport at the bottom of the pit so users are returned to the top if they fall. They are returned to the middle area inbetween the two spawn areas.\r\n- Made boxes so players can jump on them and get to the middle area.\r\n- Allowed access to the walls of the map so that players can walk on them and get there via the stairs I've added.\r\n\r\nThese changes are quite simple, but they can really help the people wishing to make a good 24/7 ZombieMod breakfloor server. So, I suggest unless you hate breakfloor maps, that you download this map and try it out.\r\n\r\n==========\r\nFINAL has been released:\r\n\r\n- Retextured again to give more of a \"dust2\" feel.\r\n- Maximum optimization for the least amount of FPS loss and lag possible.\r\n- Fixed teleportation issues that may occur when falling down the shoot.\r\n- Made bsp filesize smaller for easy downloading.\r\n- Fixed buyzone problems.\r\n- Fixed lighting issues.\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS ARE NOW UP-TO-DATE\r\nScreenshots are displaying breakfloorzm_final.\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading!\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGrey-Echo (Â£cho)\r\nFPSBanana ZombieMod Representative\r\nhttp://ech0-gaming.com"
