	"_sText": "This is just simple fun themed aim map, nothing special. Basically I followed the same kinda of layout as aim_awp but with a twist and a theme. Sorry I have not posted here since code_name_otter but the site limits files  size. My last 3 maps are all over the limit, one by 80 megs. Since I am here might as well pimp'em. You can find them under Chris'slayerA'Powell on csm2.net. If you liked this map, congo, and otter, please try cs_clubmetal, de_maya, and de_golf.  You can also find cs_clubmetal and de_maya on lanmaniax.com"
