If you want the bigger version, click <A href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/119753>here</a> \r\n\r\nThis is a mario themed, wall climbing, water swimming Gun Game map. Lots of fun. The two teams climb a building in the middle, they can go to the top, the sides, or they can go through the middle of the building, which is water. \r\n\r\nOh, and this was inspired by the map gg_wallfight. I can't find the author of it, if anyone knows, please tell me so I can give him credit. "
