Don't worry though, there are no clan markings in the map.\r\n-High capacity, 15 spawnpoints for each team, 30 spawns total.\r\n-Fully symmetrical, creating ideal Gun Game gameplay.\r\n\r\nThis map was known as gg_trainstation as my WiP, but due to a name conflict with another map, I changed it to gg_citystation_ses.\r\n\r\nAuthor's Roles:\r\nsE_Guru_Janitor - Head mapper, designer, producer.\r\nsE_Muffin_Man - secondary designer.\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::\r\nTerms of Use:\r\ngg_citystation_ses can be used in any CS:S server, owned for public or private use.
