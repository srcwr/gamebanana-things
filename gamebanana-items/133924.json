This is to fix a spawn bug.\r\n- Changed around some textures, finally got around to painting alpha on my displacements.\r\n- Made my skybox smaller and touched it up a bit.\r\n- Changed around the lighting, I think this angle is much more aesthetically pleasing.\r\n- Also addressed the frame-rate problem.</div>\r\n\r\nThis map is currently in circulation on the xF |:. Clan RPG Deathmatch server: 216.151.188.240:27019"
