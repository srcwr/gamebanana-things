It's a totally created from scratch and carefully optimized .nav-file (because included in original mapauthor's release the .nav-file was not perfect playable auto-gen).<br><br>This Navigation Mesh is hand-made approximately for 80% 'cause auto-gen constructed many areas inexact.<br><br>Bots use almost all possible ways now and move through all areas of this map absolutely consciously. They even sometimes misbehave on the Playground... as the most ordinary adults :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the navigation file by chizbone included in original maparchive and available to downloading with the <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/187375\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks.<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: Slove1 (for nice CS:S port of the good CS:GO official map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin ;-)<br><br>"
