The zombies soon attacked from behind the Airport coming from the runway and over took the back side of the Airport. Get ready the zombies are coming!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the original no longer works after the patch.  I had to make several changes to update the map to work with the latest patch. Please enjoy! \r\n\r\nThe map is a lot smaller now because I deleted most of the back half of the Airport. I also added more spots in the front section.\r\n\r\n- 64 Spawns\r\n- 3d Skybox\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Optimized even more for better FPS\r\n- Plenty more secret spots\r\n- Overview radar map\r\n- Soundscapes\r\n- Buy Zones\r\n\r\nSecret spots include: vents, illusionary walls, teleport locations and breakable walls.\r\n\r\nMany things have been changed and added into this second version, a few things include:\r\nAdded some more connector vents to speed up getting around the map.\r\nRemoved one of the two planes from the 3d skybox in order to reduce skybox lag.\r\nMade dozens of ‘tweaks’ to camping spots, both with cades and no cades.\r\nWidened the door on the plane.\r\nAdded multiple Soundscapes\r\nRemoved some props and added others in various locations around the map.\r\nAll breakable glass that was previously set to 5,000HP has now been reduced to 1,000-1,5000HP.\r\nModified most crouch spots to be more balanced/ less overpowered for humans.\r\n\r\nAnd many more changes that I won’t list.\r\n\r\nThis is the Second version, please enjoy, comment and rate!\r\n\r\n<object width=\"500\" height=\"405\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2MsSug25ICs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6&amp;border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2MsSug25ICs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6&amp;border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"500\" height=\"405\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nCGTextures - Custom Textures \r\n[-B-] - Custom Textures\r\nEric - Custom Textures\r\nTopHATTwaffle - Custom Textures\r\nAlcobot – Elevator\r\n\r\nBlair (Bobpoblo) Burkhardt – Level Design\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/members/776402"
