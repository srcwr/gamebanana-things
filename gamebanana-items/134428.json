Meant to be the first public test release, so download it and put it on your server then tell me what people think about it!\r\n\r\nTwo spawn areas, holding up to a maximum of 24 persons on each team (reccomend about 12 each team).  This map is a fun one to play, and it's not huge and overly spacious.  \r\n\r\nOne thing... DONT FALL OFF!  Lol.  Yeah It's about a 300-ft drop to the bottom.\r\n\r\nMy xfire is in my profile here or in the readme.txt inside the folder.\r\n\r\nMake sure to give me suggestions on what to add for v2b!"
