	"_sText": "Originally this was just a map I made because I was bored. At the time I was still learning how to do rounded corners. This map was put off until I polished it up. Then it was put off again and re-polished. So here it is! This map is a replica of the original 2d Pacman game. I tried to spice it up by adding the red and blue colors. This indicates where you are. Red is Terrorists and Blue is Counter-Terrorists. I also made the sides into teleports that teleport you into the middle. Have fun!\r\n\r\nMade by Conch\r\n---\r\nI got these CUSTOM textures here\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/320\r\n---\r\n24 spawn points\r\nColor indicator\r\nTwo Teleports\r\nFast game-play\r\nCustom Textures\r\n---"
