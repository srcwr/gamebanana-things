I've played this map many many hours on Americas Army and i wanted to have it in Cs:s.\r\nThis is like the 7th version of my map but i recently managed to optimize it as much as possible. We've played the map enough on our server to test it for bugs and all bugs we found have been corrected. \r\nPlease go easy on me! :P\r\nHave fun with it! :)\r\n\r\nGreetzZ KC`Pulse\r\nwww.kaoticcrew.be"
