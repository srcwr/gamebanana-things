There are still bugs and detail missing from the map.\r\n\r\nI've started producing this map on the 26th October 2007.\r\n\r\nI made this map to be equally fun and tactical, with frantic encounter spots and full of boxes.\r\n\r\nPlease comment and give some advice on how to improve the map. Any additional ideas would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nThankyou, and enjoy playing."
