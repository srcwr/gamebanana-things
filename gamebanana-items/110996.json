Think of it more like a maze like structure. A series of protective walls to prevent the player from getting sniped. My goal here is not to get the player lost in the maze!&nbsp;<br><br>I hope that you will enjoy the gameplay and have fun! :)<br><br>And remember!&nbsp;<br><br>When swimming in pipes always look up!&nbsp;<br><br>Feel free to comment and by all means let me know if you find any bugs or other issues of the map."
