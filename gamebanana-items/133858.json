The setting is down in a valley and the theme was made to have a fort look.  \r\nThis is a symmetrical map for even teamplay and each home base has 3 floors that are accessible by ladders. \r\nThe map includes a 3D skybox and there are 34 spawn points. \r\nThere is also a nav file included. \r\nI'm open to all constructive criticism."
