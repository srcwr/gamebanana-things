All 64 jumps are possible without it.</li><li>This map was designed with eventqueuefix in mind, do not use boosterfix as it is outdated.</li><li>This map was designed with no rngfix in mind. It will make kz slopes worse in some places.</li><li>This map was not compressed with bspzip because it caused game freezes on soundscape changes.</li><li>Avoid triggering round restart on a server, as it will cause a crash because of edicts limit. You will understand once you see the size of the map.</li></ul><br>Track list is inside the bsp in case you need it.<br>"
