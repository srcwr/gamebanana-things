	"_sText": "This prefab contains 4 vmfs; each a different version of the same building.  Check the README file for more information.  One extremely detailed full version, an exterior only, and two lesser detailed versions.  The prefabs were inspired by GTA 4, they focus on a cityscape environment, this prefab pack is extremely detailed and intended to help add detail to your maps!  \r\n\r\nFeel free to modify my prefabs to the needs of your map, I made them so they are intentionally easy to modify for your own needs! The map displayed in the screenshots is a showcase map intended to demonstrate the prefabs as effectively as possible (not all of them are in the file).\r\n\r\nNote I: Please Credit me on release of your map if you use one of my prefabs, (Terrora).\r\n\r\nNote II: If you have any suggestions for future prefabs please tell me!  And I will do my best to make it for you asap!\r\n\r\nThanks Alex (Terrora / Roluffy)"
