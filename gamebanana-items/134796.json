Don't forget to rate and comment :D\r\n\r\nWell, here it is. My first map. I decided to make a small gungame map, because its simple and easy to make. 3 spawn points for each team, a buyzone for each team and a working skybox. I was going to make a room under it but i haven't figured out how to make working ladders yet. Enjoy!"
