Your mission is to rescue the remaining 4 hostages from the terrorist's stronghold and bring them back safely to the \r\ninsertion point.  If the rescue mission is not going well, there is an old cave that you bring the hostages to where they will be safe.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: You were already given a large ransom payment for the hostages but decided to ask for more money. Being that you don't like to hear \"no\", your group killed one of the hostages and will kill more unless the extra money is delivered! \r\n\r\nFuntime is over.  Someone must pay!  \r\n\r\nMap Title\t\t: CS Forest Insurrection\r\nRelease Date\t\t: June 14st, 2008\r\nFile name\t\t: cs_forest_insurrection_v1.bsp \r\nAuthor\t\t\t: Redclaw\r\nIM/Email Address\t: tachyonrays@hotmail.com\r\nWebsite\t\t\t: http://home.comcast.net/~redclaws/\r\nMax Players\t\t: (32) 16 vs. 16\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n------------\r\nBy way of introduction, I am \"Redclaw\" and I have spent the last 4 years mapping for AVP2. I also served as a map reviewer for PlanetAVP. \r\nAbout 6 months ago I jumped in the Half Life 2 and CounterStrike arena feet first. It's been a total blast and I love the HL2 world. \r\nIf play AVP2 and would like to check out those maps please PM me.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUnzip the files cs_forest_insurrection_v1.bsp:\r\nSteam\\Steamapps\\<<your username>>\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\\\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n------------\r\nChanging the map name from \"cs_forest_inssurection_v1.bsp\" to anything else will cause\r\nall the special visual effects (specularity) to stop working as the cubemaps have been compiled \r\nfor this map filename only. Basically the map will look like crap if you change it's name.\r\n\r\nHL2 Deathmatch Maps by Redclaw:\r\n------------\r\n\r\ndm_larkhill_detention_cntr_V1.bsp\r\ndm_narnia_hunting_grounds_v5.bsp\r\ndm_forest_vendetta_V1.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_Vendetta_snow_V3.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_vendetta_sun_v3.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_vendetta_war_se_v1.bsp\r\ndm_narnia_llw_winter_storm_v1.bsp\r\n\r\nOther Notes:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me (tachyonrays@hotmail.com) with suggestions and bugs you might find in my maps.\r\n\r\nI run a dedicated server called \"Redclaws Dedicated Source Server\", please come join anytime.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n* COPYRIGHT/PERMISSIONS *\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAuthors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels.\r\n\r\nYou MUST NOT distribute this level UNLESS you INCLUDE THIS FILE WITH\r\nNO MODIFICATIONS. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"
