Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the Militant Environmentalists from destroying the two critical points: the transformer loading bay and the center top of the dam. Terrorists: Destroy either critical point to cause a breach in the dam's structural integrity, thus allowing the river reclaim its natural course and beauty once more.\""
