	"_sText": "This is a map I made from scratch but is based off of the original surf_skate_park. You must surf the three levels and if you fall on any of them you will get teleported to a half pipe jail where you fight with shotguns. If you get to the end of the map you have a choice between the ct and t spawns, or the jail. If you choose one of the spawns you will be teleported there to hunt people down with a shotgun. If you choose the jail option everybody's weapons in jail will be stripped and everyone's health, including the winners will be set to one. The winner will fight in jail with a shotgun and meanwhile, a glass wall will break revealing a rack of scouts for the other prisoners to fight with, but remember everyone only has one health! Have some fun and I hope to see this map on some servers!"
