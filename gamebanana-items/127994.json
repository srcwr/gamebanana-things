With a whole new world every round, gameplay will be different each time. The possibilities are endless!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild your world:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nTen players will be selected to build the level, 5 per team. Four players will build fortifications on two different levels, four will build floors, one will choose game settings, and one will select music.

Fall from the sky right on top of your enemy!\r\n\r\n- Swap sides. Let's hope the base you built isn't that great, because it now belongs to your opponent!\r\n\r\n- Temporary fog. For 30 seconds, you will hardly be able to see your hands in front of your face!\r\n\r\n- Defend the base mode. Stop the enemy from reaching your base!\r\n\r\n- Low gravity. Jump over any obstacle and glide across space!\r\n\r\n- +HP. Everyone is now a 250 HP juggernaut!\r\n\r\n- Side cover. Tired of snipers watching the flanks? Fear not!\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic to kill (or dance) to:\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nOne player will get to select their favorite tune each round:\r\n\r\n- Radiohead: Jigsaw Falling Into Place\r\n\r\n- The Beatles: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\r\n\r\n- The Who: My Generation\r\n\r\n- Skyrim OST: Dragonborn\r\n\r\n- The Black Keys: 10 A.M.
