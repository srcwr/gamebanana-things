	"_sText": "Welcome to the new FPS gaming sandman css map!<br><br>I created the sandman map as a break from the repetitive comp matches and to have some fun with my friends. Here is the css little brother. here a brief description of the map as a whole and the method of gameplay.<br>Sandman is a bomb defusal map with a twist in the shape of a huge pyarmid and a huge red X on the top. The terrorists try to get to the top of the pyramid to plant the bomb and the counter-terrorists try and stop them. It's not as easy as that though as it takes a fair amount of time to jump over each step and multiple angles to get shot in the back of the head. There are four ladders on each corner of the map that leads to a ledge going round the whole of the map and many boxes to hide behind.<br><br>"
