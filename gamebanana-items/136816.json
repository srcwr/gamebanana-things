Every single texture you cant see is nodraw so there is no lag.\r\nIt is a smallish size but can hold up to around 40 people at the total max. I got the idea from one of my last maps (gg_lab_test) It turned out to be too small so I made this. A much bigger version. \r\n\r\nSorry for low quality screen shots. \r\nPlease assess and leave constructive feed back.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking."
