	"_sText": "My second version of piratewars I made. This one does the map alot more justice. Use cannons to sink the other teams boat, or to kill them by hitting them with cannonballs which do 50 damage, or knife them to death. The screenshot shows the maps changelist which includes: New Visual effects-high resolution textures i made- 3d skybox- Lighting for the map, cannonballs deal 50 player damage, small broken boat with grenades in center, Smaller boats take 2 hits to kill and drive faster, new cannon sounds, Boarding plank from boat to boat. Tell me what you think.\r\n\r\nSet for up to 30 spawns\r\nPlease stop by Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect.."
