This grants you 20 points.\r\n\r\nThis map has no jail, it has a point system, which grants you points depending on how far you get. (Level 3 - 3 points etc.)\r\n\r\nIf you finish the map you will be granted 10 points, and a button that ends the round.\r\n\r\nThe timer is set to 5 minutes, if that runs out, you will be granted points depending on your level.\r\n\r\nThe bonus entrance is at the end of 3. (Made by Zoomj)\r\n\r\nThere are several secrets in this map, if you see a sprite( a glowing little thing), try walking into it, and see what happens. There is also a hidden knife at spawn. ( it is in a corner and it is invisible)\r\n\r\nA big thanx to zoomj for his wonderful bonus, and Sangre for the awesome texture scheme (looking forward to your next map ; P )\r\n\r\nAlso a big thanks goes out to KSF.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy playing my map, and have fun ; )"
