	"_sText": "Yea, it is called aikasauna, not taikasauna, since some Finnish players might think i misspelled maps name. But about map, i got idea of it from this one place i went this summer (2011). I was going to actually make map look exactly same as it is in real, but then i got some better ideas and here it is then. Two days of work, and i think this is pretty much my best map so far. It has  light_env, unlike my other maps, so it looks fancy.\r\n\r\nDL and give me your opinion. Installing is easy, just extract .bsp file to your map folder : )"
