	"_sText": "This is a fixed and improved version. Name changed from !abaddon! to abaddon for those who have downloaded the older version.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nTextures- \r\n*The Eye abusive gold texture around the top level was replaced with a smoother metal.\r\n*Bottom level floor was the black snake skin and it has been changed with a transparent metal with lava flowing through. This helps to see the players better and gives a lighted affect so that its not so dark as it was before.\r\n\r\nArchitecture-\r\n* The player spawn doors open with simplicity. the doors no longer jam themselves with a bot being retarded. just push forward and your out. \r\n\r\nAdvertisement- \r\nRemoved the server command that spammed the server with my name. Sorry bout that in the last one! This one has no pop ups at all.\r\n\r\nThis map is excellent for knifing! \r\nThis map requires a lil more skill with the bottom level's floor being metal. So, Shhhhh.... Ninjas are larking. \r\n\r\nOwn a CSS Game server? I want to make you a free map!\r\nJoin my MAPROSCOPIC GROUP on steam and send me a message!\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/ew_map"
