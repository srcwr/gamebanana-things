	"_sText": "I was aiming for a larger style fy_iceworld type map.\r\n\r\nThe map supports 64 players with enough weapons for everyone.\r\n\r\nthe map is roughly 4 times the size of fy_iceworld, has many nooks and crannies in the cliffs to camp. there are snowdrifts and unique barricades to add the cover.\r\n\r\nI would recommend 22 - 64 players on this map.\r\n\r\nThis map took me about 3 - 5 days to complete.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling is also raised so those low gravity servers can enjoy the map too."
