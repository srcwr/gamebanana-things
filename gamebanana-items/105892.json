Otherwise, it is just about the same. There is a small easter egg, although no hints on how to find it are being given :).\r\n\r\nMap critics are going to talk about lighting, I know. I can honestly say I've made maps in CS:S for only a few weeks, with previous experience in Condition Zero. I'm still having trouble figuring out good lighting methods.\r\n\r\nEnjoy my map, spread it around, and have fun!"
