Its a small map and it almost\r\nlooks like an \"Labyrinth\", because there is lots of Walls and places\r\neverywhere in the map.\r\n\r\nBut what makes this map so special is Water, (what makes your enemies to\r\nhear you more easily) and Underground passages where you can also Dive and\r\nSwim... Sorry i forgot.. There is also deadly water."
