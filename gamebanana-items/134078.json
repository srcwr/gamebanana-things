	"_sText": "Made by Hanzo\r\n\r\nThis map was inspired by a 3d model of a castle and gg_churches. I have always wanted to make this map, but never had the time. I still don't but I needed to get it out of me lol. It's comprised of two castles, identical in construction but different in texture so you know where you are on the map. In between the castles is a garden maze where soldiers can use the bushes and large oak tree for cover before assaulting. On one side there is a tunnel breach and on the other is a wooden catwalk."
