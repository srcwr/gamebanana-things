It was originally  released about two and a half years ago. It is a very fun map and is a classic many people have tried to remake it and they all have fail. I decide to re submit this map because I can no longer find it on any servers. The map consist of Towers that players can camp on. The players must camp together. When the zombie spawns he will kill the players he is camping with. If he fails he will have a hard time. This is one of the best maps of all time. \r\n\r\nTHIS MAP DOES NOT WORK FOR UNLIMITED AMMO "
