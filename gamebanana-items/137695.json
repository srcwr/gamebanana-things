	"_sText": "I bring you surf_pyramidfort_beta, the first in a series of combat maps whose main goal is to entice the player (you) to stray away from the dull and boring \"skill\" surf.\r\n\r\nThis map was inspired by mashing surf_pyramidduel and surf_blockfort into one. Thus, surf_pyramidfort_beta.\r\n\r\nThose who have played both will find that it replicates the feel of said levels. The gun placement from surf_blockfort has been kept and slightly remodeled to flow with the design of surf_pyramidduel.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\nGameplay: Turn on that dusty, never-used server reserved for combat, load up the level, and play it with lots of people if you want to test the gameplay."
