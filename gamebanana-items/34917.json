	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map DE_GREENE<br><br>Nav Creator: Meurglis3, Release Date: March 28 2017<br><br>Here is the Navigation Mesh for nice military-styled map <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/194827\">de_greene</a> by DNvCross, DNvLasrever &amp; cashed (released June 2010). It's a totally created from scratch and carefully optimized .nav-file (because in original author's release the .nav-file probably was simple auto-gen).<br><br>This Navigation Mesh was hand-made approximately for 90% 'cause auto-gen constructed many areas inexact. The special attention was paid to important paths with difficult geometry - ladders to/from the uderground part, all windows and stairs.<br><br>Well... the bots use all possible ways now. They will smoke all rats from bunkers or will fill up their entrances with the blood-stained corpses :D<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing an original auto-gen .nav-file available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/194827\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play &amp; Enjoy! Always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks.<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: DNvCross, DNvLasrever &amp; cashed (for nice logical sequel of all known map)<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>A millions ghosts of heroes killed at Prodigy strictly watch you from each shaded corner :-)"
