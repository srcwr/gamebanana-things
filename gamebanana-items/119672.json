Some Counter Terrorists have been sent to neutralize them... But they have been woken up when they were sleeping, so they forget their weapons :o ! (Sorry, the scenario is not really believable, but I did'n find anything better ^^)\r\n\r\nObjective and description of the map : In this map, you have to kill the enemy team...\r\nYou begin with a knife, but it's a weapons storage, so you will be able to find weapons in multiple places of the map... But to pick up these maps, you will have to open a door by pressing a button which is in the control room (at the first floor), or you will have to take the weapons in a room... But this one is protected by lasers ^^'. Of course you can choose to fight with your knife directly ^^ !\r\n\r\n(Sorry, my english is not perfect... ^^)"
