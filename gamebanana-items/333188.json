Do you have what it takes to explore such a vast and dangerous place?<br><br>This map is my sixth and final (for the foreseeable future) surf map. This project took roughly 10 months and an estimated 2000 hours, making it by far my biggest level. It is both an homage to many of the older surf maps and of my journey as a mapper, resulting in a celebration and culmination of everything this gamemode, and designing for it, has taught me.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to thank everyone who was involved with the creation of the map, as it would not have been possible to release it as it is now without that crucial guidance and support.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you all enjoy this map as much as I enjoyed working on it :)<br><br>Ensure that game sounds are turned on for the definitive surf_embrace experience&nbsp;<br><br>T6 Linear 3500 maxvel<br>5 checkpoints<br>6 Bonuses<br>"
