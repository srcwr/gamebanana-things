	"_sText": "GG_Resol_Gz4 Map Info\r\n\r\nSize: Medium \r\nBots: Nav file included. \r\nSpawn Points: 12 for each side \r\nDiscription: T and CT spawn in Different rooms which mirror each other and have 2 exits to get each other. The Rooms they start in are right on top of each other and as they exit the rooms can easy run into each other. \r\nCreators Thoughts: I Like this map as well.  Its easy to find the last bot and it seems to be hard to get to the Flash Nads,  which i was wanting since we dont want someone to camp them.  Even if they did camp it, its hard to use the nad and not be flashed your self. BUT the smoke nads CAN be spamed if theres few ppl left and there not careful :)\r\nBugs: None really other then the bots seem to ALL want to go the same way and they sometimes get stuck on each other.  Also not a big problem but u can hear foot steps from almost any ware. "
