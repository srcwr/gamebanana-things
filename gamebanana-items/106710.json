So I've been thinking about making a remake of it, and here it is.\r\n\r\n<u>beta 1</u>_________________\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n+ 3dskybox\r\n+ Detail\r\n+ texture work improved\r\n+ env_sun\r\n+ light_env\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nI dont know the author of the original map, I searched for the map here on the banana to see if I could find the author but I didnt. Anyway I prefer to leave all the credits of the map to him and to valve. Have fun!\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
