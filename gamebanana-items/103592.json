It taught me a lot about the layout of maps and playtesting it on a server with real people really helped to balance it out.\r\n\r\nThis map was playtested by people in the GpX clan back in early 2006, and the almighty Toku from TeamLogitech.fi had a go on it. Thanks Toku, it made my day :)\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, the objective is to destroy the crates as Terrorists, and to defend those precious crates as CT."
