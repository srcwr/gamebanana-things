It is meant to be used in Counter-Strike:Source. \r\nTo install just extract the bsp file included in the RAR file into your \"maps\" folder.\r\n\r\nI know, it lacks a video but I seriously don't have time for that. Also the screens are not that good either since the map is huge. Please download and try it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n***EDIT***\r\nThanks to MiniMadness I know have a video! \r\n\r\n<object width=\"350\" height=\"310\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sqOajPtD7fg&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sqOajPtD7fg&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"350\" height=\"310\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n"
