This is the first time I added a map to FPS and I'm kinda excited. I'm hopeing to add more and even make a part 3 to this map. Part 1 was not added cause there was no lighting. I figure I will be makeing more, but for now have to figure out how to add custom textures I will be making the part 3 with all our the sprays I made for my server and clan members into that map. Long with a lot of changes that will make the map even more cooler \"is that a word lol\"\r\n\r\nPART 3 IS MADE. Loacted at\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/114324\r\n\r\nCome check out the Server if u like:\r\nOldTimmers Club 100 Tic FD Family Friendly\r\n64.120.22.188:27015"
