I begin my return with this map: surf_the_gloaming (pronounced \"the glow-ming\").\r\n\r\nThis map all begins with FAJ (what good maps isn't he a part of?). He told me to get off my lazy ass and make an \"EPIC\" surf map. After much enticing, I finally got around to doing it. This is the result. I am not so sure how epic this map is; I leave that to you to decide. I incorporated all aspects of mapping in which I am proficient: skyboxes, ramps, neat geometry, flow, learning curves, texturing, and logic systems. This map has taught me much.\r\n\r\nIt's just a linear surf map. Nothing more, nothing less (well, maybe a little bit more). There are a few secrets, some of which I particularly enjoy (Scout Battles!)\r\n\r\nI have MANY people I need to thank for helping me test this map (in no particular order):\r\n\r\nTeeth\r\nshini\r\nintox.Juicy J\r\nintox.japetheape\r\nintox.cLutch\r\nintox.Scarface\r\nintox.waffleburger\r\nintox.Mani\r\n(any other intox members I may have left out)\r\nknife\r\nJesuswashomeless\r\nRyan S\r\nSintaxError\r\nEmmitt Nervend"
