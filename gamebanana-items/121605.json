	"_sText": "So this is a revision of surf_akai_final. Working on surf_akai_2 got me thinking I should fix some things in the first one. The jail has received a 60% change, hopefully for the better, camping should be almost eliminated now. I added several more secrets around the map. I hope this can be the version you all originally wanted, and I apologize for not getting surf_akai_2 to you all sooner, but it should be done soon. \r\n\r\nFrom the first version I would still like to thank:\r\n\r\nFlippi\r\nWhaThe\r\n-[RR]-\r\nArchAngel\r\nAlexRoyce\r\nYumitski\r\nBrokenSurf.com\r\nInterlopers.Net\r\n\r\nFor this FINAL FINAL version:\r\n\r\nBuck\r\nFAJ\r\nX SHARK\r\n\r\nAnyway thats that. Hope you all enjoy this one and look forward to akai_2!!\r\n\r\nbtw: player limit was increased from 32 to 48"
