And added buyzones now.\r\nI found some bugs, due to microbrushes, but they won't be on the final version.\r\nThe water appears black some times, I didn't figured out what is causing that, but it has something to do with hdr and bloom, so play a little bit with the graphics settings and the water will eventually appear correctly. If you happen to figure out why the water appears bloack let me know.\r\nKEEP UP THE FEEDBACK GUYS!"
