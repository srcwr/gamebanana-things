It was while designing the side exit that the curved minimlist structures took shape and i thought it looked great, so ran with the idea. By the time i got to the bridge section it had evolved into what it was, but this also presented a problem. Players could see eachother from either spawn, so i needed to block this off. Once players reached Deagle, Rifles and scoped Rifles, spawn kills would be a big disaster, so i placed the center structure to deal with that. Couple of glitches appeared on final compile, it would take me ages to remove, so i'll either move on or come back and fix if people like the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528.
