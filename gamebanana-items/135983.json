	"_sText": "So i was sick of studying the other day, and feeling inspired by the great cell shading tutorial by lost, combined with my love of trippy-glowing things, i decided i would make this map. Its a kind of new-ish take on the TRON theme, in that its more curved and has the trippy glowing thing going on. \r\nThe layout makes for more close-up combat, with some oppurtunity for long range.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map as much as i enjoyed making it."
