	"_sText": "Second version of this map. Now with a NAV File made by chizbone.\r\n\r\nBomb/Defuse map based on the famous Combat Arms' map (Junk Flea).\r\n\r\nMap: An important junkyard placed in the south of\r\nCalifornia. The place reduce junk and recicle them\r\nto use it in shotguns shells. This place is the only\r\nprovider of this recicled plastic to make shells. If\r\nthe recicle cycle stops by any reason, shotguns will\r\nneed to be removed from the US Army.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrorists: destroy the electrical center in order\r\nto make the factory stop working and prevent\r\nterrorists from all over the world being killed by\r\nthe US shotguns.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounter Terrorists: prevent Terrorists get inside the\r\nelectrical system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: the electrical center is next to the Counter\r\nTerrorists Spawn with two red lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalation: extract and replace the maps folder in your cstrike directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this map i used the '8 theory' of mapping: the map is an eight (refeer to the last screenshot).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease give good feedback."
