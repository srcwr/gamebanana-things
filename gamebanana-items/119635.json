	"_sText": "I made this map, because when i watched AvP (the film) i realy liked the labyrinth idea. So i decaded to make something similar. In this map are the floors, walls and the ceiling changeing in 10-20 seconds. There are traps too, so be careful! :) \r\nSpecail thanks to UMBRELLAJackson for his/her helicopter.: http://www.gamebanana.com/css/prefabs/2331\r\n\r\nExtract to counter-strike source folder.
