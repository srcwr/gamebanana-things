Players can jump over the center dividers to get to the other side as well.  Because of the size of the map, some aesthetics were left out in order to improve FPS.  \r\n\r\nAll players start with the following equipment:  AWP sniper rifle, Deagle pistol, Knife, and Kevlar vest. There are no buy zones.\r\n\r\n- 52 Spawn Points, 26 per team\r\n- No Buy Zones\r\n- Nav File for bots\r\n- Overview radar map included\r\n- 3d Skybox\r\n- All files compiled into the bsp using Pakrat\r\n\r\nHappy Sniping!\r\n\r\nBlair (Bobpoblo) Burkhardt - Level Design\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/members/776402"
