Sadly because source doesnt have knife headshots this is now trying to hit your enemy in the back. Wich will prob. take some more of the tactics thing.\r\n(btw.. the bright floors are so you can see the blood better :P)\r\n(Oh and for the ones that dont know, if you dont get hit in the back or seriously grouped, your health goes back to 100 hp)"
