The British SAS have set up in a nearby barn poised to strike.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorist Objective: Rescue the hostages from the abandoned oasthouse and return them to the barn.  Use the tunnel for a stealth strategy but be aware of ambushes, or rush through the allotment quickly.  The Courtyard is vulnerable to snipers but has lots of connective strategy. \r\n\r\nTerrorist Objective: Prevent Counter-Terrorists from rescuing the hostages. Use the upper floor for sniping terrorists in the courtyard. Terrorists can reach the greenhouse first. Guard the hostages using the house as cover.\r\n\r\nNote: There is a switch to operate the garage door for an alternative exit."
