	"_sText": "GG_FURIOUS By: XsilentXbyteX\r\n============================\r\nCurrent map name: gg_furious_v1\r\nGG_Furious is a very simple very fast paced gungame map.\r\nIt has 20 spawns on each side. The recommended amount of players is unknown at this time. (If you run this map on your server, please provide any and all feedback on spawn placement and size.) The map is designed to run a very quick gungame while providing fun fast paced action.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map is still currently in its beta stage and is V1. This is one of my first gungame maps made. As the map grows and I receive more feedback, textures, layout, spawns and feel are subject to change. There is currently no lighting due to it being in Beta stage.\r\n\r\nIf you find any problem or errors on this map, please contact me and I will do my best to fix them as fast as I can."
