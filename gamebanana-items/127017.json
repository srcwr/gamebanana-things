	"_sText": "This map is based on the movie Indiana Jones, specifically the one where Indiana Jones is chased by a boulder in a cave. It has in total 14 traps, so it's not too easy, but not too hard.\r\n\r\nTwo of the traps are automatic, the moving walls at the start and the spinning platforms about 3/4 of the way through, so have fun! At the end, you now get a hat with your shotgun, so you can feel and look like Indie himself!\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading!\r\n\r\n~ Sneeza"
