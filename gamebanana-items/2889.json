	"_sText": "This is my... 2nd?? bridge (I think).\r\n\r\nBasically, it is a dozen physboxes with diasabled motion until u walk halfway across. The delay for each physboxes is slighlty different for added effect. There is also env_shake and ambient_generic so that it seems that an earthqauke triggers its fall. I have not made the physboxes(planks) destroyable to avoid some idiot spoiling the effects for everyone. I am novice and this is my first publication on fps bannana... so be kind:) oh and if are going to use this map please let me know :)"
