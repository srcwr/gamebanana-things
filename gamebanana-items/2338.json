I have been thinking that I might take this farther and make a GG map out of it.\r\n\r\nThought I would also throw it up here to let anybody else use it.\r\n\r\nUses: Lights, Props, Smoke, Sparks, Background Sound (Machinery Humming), Cables/Ropes, Vertex Manipulation. \r\n\r\nHas been properly NoDraw'd and Func_Detailed for optimization.\r\n\r\nLeft the textures for you guys to do, I don't want to do it all. Some sexy custom space textures will look good here.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it guys.\r\n\r\nPlease Download/Asses it for me, its the only way I will learn...."
