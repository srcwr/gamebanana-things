Anyone\r\nwho happens to make a functional one is more than welcome to let me know and either re-release it or simply let\r\nme update the current release.\r\n--I had originally optimized a nav file for bot use as well, but it was lost due to hard drive failure and I'm\r\nnot looking to spend the time doing it all again. Again, anyone willing to do it themselves is permitted to\r\nre-release or send the file to me to update (but you must contact me first, regardless).\r\n\r\nTHEnub 05/27/2012\r\n\r\n\r\nNAV FILE UPDATE BELOW\r\n------------------\r\nHey all! Thanks to Meurglis3, there is now an optimized .nav file for this map. Once again, at last! You can go ahead and download it from [here](http://css.gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3372 \"Go to the Gamebanana Submission\")! \r\n\r\nThanks again Meurglis3! \r\n\r\nTHEnub 1/22/2014"
