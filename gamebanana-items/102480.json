	"_sText": "This map pits Nintendo and Sega against eatchother in a battle to the death. If you are on the Nintendo side (CT) you have access to many warp pipe routes around your side of the map, the best sniping spots of the map, and access to a house from the game animal crossing. The mission for those sided with Sega is to blow up Nintendo's giant master sword or their Animal Crossing house. Sega has the advantages of the best cover and a back route to Nintendo's side using the power of Sonic's rings. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you like this map I think it's pretty cool. Sorry to all you Sony and Microsoft people they are just to realistic for me to map and still have fun :(. "
