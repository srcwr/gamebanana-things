This was my third map and now looking forward to start build a new one. Can't say when it will be done.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix all bugs and gliches but can't say that for 100% sure. Map will supports now 64 players as i told earlier on betas info. But if any bugs discovered plese send me a message about those so i can fix them. \r\n\r\nHave a plenty of fun with this wicked release."
