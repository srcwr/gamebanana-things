	"_sText": "Multigames map designed to be like world of everyone's favorite hedgehog. There are some similarities with 4all_multigames, because this supposed to be csgo version of it, but I went further this time. You won't find 50 levels of original mingames packed into one multigame, there are plenty of such maps... \r\n\r\n### <font color='#0D7ADF'>This one is different:</font>\r\n- No dev \"one texture to rule them all\" textures\r\n- No simple design\r\n- No crazy minigames, here you run, jump or fight - as Sonic would do\r\n- Each zone can be started with different settings - HP, weapon, difficulty (as you know it from 4all)\r\n- In every zones there are several rings to collect (each giving you one \"kill\" score)\r\n<br> \r\n\r\n### <font color='#0D7ADF'>Also featuring:</font>\r\n- Classic Sonic music \r\n- Beautiful world not unlike that of the Sonic games\r\n- and many other minor \"Sonic elements\""
