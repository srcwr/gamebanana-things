	"_sText": "Fun symmetrical map, 2 kind of combine like forts on either side of the map, and an open combat area in the middle. The gate in the middle opens and closes ever 13seconds (or so) but bullets still hit through it sometimes with less damage than normal. There's also an alternate route over the top of the gate. Please comment and assess!\r\n\r\n(if there are any missing textures or anything in the map please let me know, although I'm pretty damn sure there aren't)"
