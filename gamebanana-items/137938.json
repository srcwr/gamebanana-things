This port is not in its final stage yet.<br>Many things are not perfect like the scaling/placement of textures or usage of brushes but neither was the original map. The map is definitely ready to play and looks decent enough, imo. I plan to make a final version with the things listed above fixed and some more decals and maybe some props too."
