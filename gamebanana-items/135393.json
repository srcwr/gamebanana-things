	"_sText": "This is a sequel of sorts to my gg_inflames, i liked that map, but it was a little too small and simple, i kept the texture and map style, but added some new stuff. The map contains buyzones if you want to play with some bots on a private server or just want to play it out of gungame form.  The map is somewhat small, but not tiny it was tested with 8 players, but could use 10 or 12, all the way up to 32, but i dont advise that many...\r\n\r\nThe map is fully packed in pakrat so all the texture files are with the .bsp so you wont have to add them seperately.  The map comes with a .nav file so you wont have to create it.\r\n\r\n-CT bots seem to have troubles in spawn depending if they spawn at the top or bottom of the wood ledge\r\n-all bots seem to go the same way, but eventually get scrambled up so they can come from almost anywhere from what it seems"
