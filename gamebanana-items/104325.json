	"_sText": "COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE FANS!!!!\r\n\r\nThis is a new map called de_the_island. It takes place on an island used for loading and unloading cargo and what have you. You know, one of those random islands that people drop stuff off at. Anyways, the terrorists are supposed to blow it up... :) there are 2 bombsites that can bge reached via the open water above ground or tunnels underneath the level. Acces to the tunnels are available at either of the spawn points and will end at the bomb sites.\r\n\r\nIt is a VERY fun map and can support MANY players ( 50 ). The frame rate is GREAT on it.. HAve fun and ENJOY.\r\n\r\nFeel free to put in your rotation.. or go to \" =HcO= Hot cups of ownage \"\r\n\r\nTHANKS!\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. since the last update (9/23/05) .. Source hasnt been rendering the shadows on my models right.. its really annoying and i cant figure out why.. so in the game it may look a bit wierd. the level seems too bright and the models are bright on one side and BLACK on the other... the player model is also weird,,, its still very fun to play. and hopefully Valve will fix this problem,.. if anyone has any info on this please let me know... THANKS"
