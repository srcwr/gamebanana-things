	"_sText": "SURF_HYPER\r\n==================\r\n\r\nsurf_hyper is a staged skillsurf map made by Helix. It contains 5 stages which are easy to medium difficulty.\r\n\r\nThis map is mainly designed for timer servers, therefore there is no jail nor a timer in the map.\r\n\r\nThere is also a bonus, which contains 4 stages. All 4 stages must be no-failed in order to complete it. When you fail, you will go to the bonus spawn where you can either retry or exit.\r\n\r\nBonus can be activated by pressing \"E\" while in the out-of-space zone in stage 1. You can enter it by landing on top of the spawnbox in stage 2.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map."
