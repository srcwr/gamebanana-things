There are a few modifications but for the most part it is pretty close. The objective is to blow up the control room in the CT's basement. There are a few ways to get the from water, ladders, or ramps. The map is a duplicate on each side. This will help you find you way around. in the front upper forts, in the center, I have placed two AWP's. This is a fun sniping map! To make sure the bots don't get stuck in the water I have place a teleport on either end under the bridge. Pretty funny, someone can just show up in front of you if there is a firefight on the bridge. "
