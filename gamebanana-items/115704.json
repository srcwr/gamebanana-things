	"_sText": "Foreword : This map is NOT to be played without a certain Sourcemod plugin (or use another server modification; or simply try it and waste your time).\r\n\r\nIt works under BOTH CSS and CSGO (the b01 version didn't work for CSGO).\r\n\r\nThis map is close replicate to cs_deagle5. However, a full \"board\" of boxes are between T and CT spawn. There are NO path (nor bridge). \r\n\r\nUsing a certain plugin (see below's link), you'll be able to produce a different maze every X rounds (which is the point of the project).\r\n\r\nThe map was done through December2012 and January2013 (I just never found time to release both map+plugin).\r\n\r\nOriginal plugin's thread : [https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=220159](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=220159 \"Red Maze (of Red Wonders)\")\r\n\r\nRed"
