A fy_ map with almost all weapons (there is not pistols, sg or flashbang grenades). I'd like to thanks whoever they were the creators of fy_snow and fy_iceworld, maps like those served to me as an inspiration for this.</div>Max. 32 players, you can battle around the ground with several guns, scouts are on each rooftop and there is an awp and some grenades in each side of the map, you just need to get it faster than your enemies! Hope u like it<br><br>"
