	"_sText": "A remake of fy_infiltrate, I found an old version of it and decided a good way to get back into mapping (Havent mapped in over a year) was to make a V2 cos there were quite a few issues with the old map. This is my first big map project, and it took almost ten times as long to make as the original, so dont be too harsh ^^\r\n\r\nI've added so many details and fixes I cant really write it all down, you'll just have to play it and see. The most important additions are:\r\n\r\n- 3D skybox and lighting fixes.\r\n- Surrounding buildings and details.\r\n- New underground area.\r\n- A huge amount of bug and texture fixes\r\n- A ton of extra decals and small details\r\n- A few easter eggs, some easier to find than others ;)\r\n- Loads of new props, layout fixes, glass, indoor textures....the list goes on...\r\n\r\nBefore you rate/assess it, please take the time to have a look at the original version (aswell as this version, ofc), which can be found here: \r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/45460\r\n\r\nThe map centers around a secret compound held by the CT's. T's start outside, CT's start in the warehouse. There are a huge number of possible attack routes for both teams to take.\r\n\r\nSee the DevNotes at the bottom left for all updates/fixes since release."
