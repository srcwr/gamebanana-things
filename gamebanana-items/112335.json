The bunkers blast doors slowly begin to open and inside a player driven console sets a timer to airstrike and destroy everything outside the bunker. So anyone left needs to get in the bunker and take control of it in order to survive the blast. As the time clicks down to the blast the doors slowly close locking anyone left outside to die.\r\n"
