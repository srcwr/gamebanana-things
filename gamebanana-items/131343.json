Two sides that CT or T spawns on. CT spawns in the Cabin, T spawns outside near the gate or the guard building as I like to call it.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secret teleporters and there is a teleporter that traps glitchers in the fire room (aka the Jail). \r\n\r\nAlso in one of the rooms there is a back door so look out if you choose to camp there.\r\n\r\nI will add more info if necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd on a side note -=ETO=- Caboose is my in game name."
