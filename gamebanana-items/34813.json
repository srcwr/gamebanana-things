	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map DE_RECYCLE\r\n\r\n\r\nNav Creator: Meurglis3, Release Date: March 1 2014\r\n\r\nHere is a manually optimized Navigation Mesh for fine fast-paced junkyard-themed map [de_recycle](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/166615) by Remikseri_fin (released June 2012). It's a created from scratch and fully hand-tuned .nav-file (because original author's .nav-file was simply auto-gen and in it there were many bugs).\r\n\r\nNearly a half of this Navigation Mesh was remade manually. Well, bots freely and surely move on all space of the map now. And cold doesn't threaten them despite bustle on pools at the rain! :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/166615).\r\n\r\nPlay and Fun! All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Remikseri_fin (for his small rainy warehouse-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nTry to play the KOTH like a Rain Dogs! :-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 27.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Added Place Names;\r\n- Some other minor improvements.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
