It also features ideas such as the climbing tower and this map's ending from the Half-Life mod \"<a rel=\"hc2\" href=\"http://www.moddb.com/mods/hazardous-course-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Hazardous Course 2</a>\" by Richman.&nbsp;It's one of my all time favorite mods, highly recommend it! You may have noticed the map uses mat_fullbright 1. &nbsp;This is because of a couple of reasons, being that I couldn't compile the RAD due to maximum brush surfaces being reached, and if it does compile, the custom skybox will make everything pitch black regardless of any lighting. &nbsp;So please try to enjoy it for what it is! Please not that I designed this map to be <b>quite difficult</b>, and I tried to use some unique level design as well for the course. Also there are 4 secrets to be found, and some are extremely hard to find so well done if you figure them all out! The map also features 6 Lemon Jelly songs and 5 other fantastic songs as well.&nbsp;This is also my first real in-depth map so any constructive criticism helps. :) Also I know that the file size is so large, It's mainly due to the music in the map.&nbsp;Make sure to check out the trailer too see the map in action!</p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span><b><u>Music Used</u></b></span></p><p></p><ul><li>Space Walk - Lemon Jelly</li><li>Miles and Miles - Mint Royale</li><li>Come - Lemon Jelly</li><li>Homeward Journey - Nujabes / Uyama Hiroto</li><li>Space Loungin' - Shing02 / Bajune Tobeta</li><li>Music Sounds Better With You - Stardust</li><li>Princess (Ver. 2) - Mint Royale</li><li>The Staunton Lick - Lemon Jelly</li><li>Elements - Lemon Jelly</li><li>Stay With You - Lemon Jelly</li><li>Nice Weather for Ducks - Lemon Jelly</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Thank you for playing!</div></div></div>"
