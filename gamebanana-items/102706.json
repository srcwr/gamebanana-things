The gameplay is balanced but T have to be aggressive to win. All files are packed in the BSP. **The nav file is complete**, bots are able to walk everywhere and I added place names.\r\n\r\nReadme\r\n==================\r\nI would like feedbacks about gameplay experience and about the general design of the map. **Enjoy !**\r\n\r\n### Map Overview\r\n![overview](http://admins.left4ever.net/ressources/public_docs/de_industrial/img/de_industrial_beta_overview.jpg \"overview\")"
