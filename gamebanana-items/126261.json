	"_sText": "VERSION_3?!!?1 \r\n\r\nYep, this is a remake of my [first bunny hop map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/112601) which i decided to start right after the release of bhop_depot, 3 years ago. (About goddamn time...)\r\n\r\nSo, what's new in this version?\r\n\r\n- Added around 15 new stages\r\n- Visual change but same map layout\r\n- Few minor gameplay changes\r\n- Better fps than the earlier versions (tested on a 6 years old toaster)\r\n- Easy to medium difficulty in the later stages\r\n\r\nThis was made for speed running in mind and it was tested on a 100tic 100aa server.\r\n\r\nThanks to Aoki, Highquality, Hoover, Prox, Shellfish, Yaznee for their feedback/help along the progress of this map.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to self: Never do a remake ever again."
