	"_sText": "This map initially started out as glass_blank.  But people didn't like that.  Glass_blank had all white walls, floor, and ceiling.  Like that room in the Matrix 1 with the TV set.  The structures you see here were also in glass_blank, but the white wasn't quite a hit.  Many people complained that they couldn't see their crosshairs, that it was too bright, etc.\r\nSo I textured it and it came out like this.  Making it night seemed to be appropriate for some reason.  I like how it turned out.  "
