(The real climb ends at the apartment with the dude watching the telly), but if you collect 7 keys found in the map you'll access a nice bonus with a few surprises! (Collect keys with your Use button)\r\n\r\n---SPOILER, KEY LOCATIONS---\r\n\r\n1. On the bed in the first apartment.\r\n2. Once you climbed out of the blue maintance room, open the middle door and search your right for a hook on the floor. Open it.\r\n3. Once you climbed over the wall, it's between the dumpster and the green car. It's pretty hard to see if you don't have the flashlight.\r\n4. Go to the courtyard and find it between a few oil drums on the platform.\r\n5. In the next apartment, shoot the box on the table.\r\n6. Next apartment, next to the couch.\r\n7. Lying on the floor in the last room.\r\n\r\n---END OF SPOILER---\r\n\r\nPlease assess!!!"
