Please Download and Rate!\r\n\r\nIn this map, the Ts now spawn inside of the temple with a load of grenades, while the CTs still spawn on top of the stairs with AWPs. The Ts run to the top of the stairs while throwing the smoke grenades for more stealth to get to the top, and if you find the flashbangs, they can't even see anyone! Once you get to the top, press one of the buttons and it teleports you to the end of the map. The CTs are stuck inside of a box while you have 3 options to kill them. Either with an AK47,M4A1, OR if you have a C4 go to the top of the box (ladder behind it) plant the bomb and watch the glass box explode with the CTs in it!\r\n\r\nHere is a little taste of what you will be doing\r\n\r\nEdite spawns and Map\r\nmax 6 ct´s\r\nmax 40 t´s\r\n6 Smogs grenades\r\n3 Blend grenades\r\nMap is runing on Dreist-Gamer.com\r\n\r\nEdite Ct spawn Bug\r\n\r\n[DREIST] MINI GAME | DEATHRUN [BHop|Paintball|FastDL]\r\nIp: 78.143.57.61:27015"
