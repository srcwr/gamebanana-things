Upside-down rooms, black voids, impossible staircases, and creepy noises everywhere to enhance the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nKilling each other is no big challenge, since the spawn points of the two teams are closely together and easily accessable. Yet, the great amount of small tunnels connecting the major rooms are enough to confuse you."
