	"_sText": "This map is much larger and is actually the largest of the 4 maps. both teams start on opposite sides of the map. From spawn you can go several different directions. You can go down the road and use the broken tanks as cover as you run to the other spawn, or you can try to run for one of the 4 guard towers on the 4 corners of the map. There is also a house in this map which has a basement. In the basesment is a few boxes that you can hide behind. The house itself is nothing really great, it's got windows and a few things inside, but nothing to get really excited about. In the middle of the map is a guard house which has 2 main guard rooms. The guard house itself is an excellent piece of structure to hide behind. If you can think of a way to use it to your advantage to navigate yourself to the other team's spawn, you might get some easy kills. This map is overall a good map for dm. The size of it is perfect and the types of structure in the map work good for a dm server."
