	"_sText": "A big size map with 30 spawn points, 15 on either side.  The big open arena type outdoor area and tight unlit towers makes it a fun map for gungame or similar mods.  As with my other submission \"smg_texture1\" there are buyzones at spawn, so it should work fine with any mod or lack there of.\r\n\r\nCreated in the Hammer Editor with all standard textures & compiled in batch compiler with source tools.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: This map was previously submitted by \"imposter\".  While the .bsp files are identical the .nav file in the original was corrupted somehow.  So if you have already downloaded the first one just redownload this zip file or make your own .nav file for it.  Thank you.)"
