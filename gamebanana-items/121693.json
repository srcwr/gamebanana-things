	"_sText": "I found this map in my maps folder the other day and thought i would finish it. It is a small combat surf map, there is only a small amount of surf but thats how i planned it, there is a second sort of jail in the map, its above the first circle, the door opens every 25 seconds and there is multiple teleports around the map, so if you fall of a ramp of the edge you could end up in it... jails small, it has 2 buttons on the outside of either side to open it, there is also a secret button inside the jail to open (hint it is somewhere on my name) there is around 70 spawn points, also i did pakrat the map so you can see the skybox.\r\n\r\nThank you to:\r\nkomaokc - skybox texture"
