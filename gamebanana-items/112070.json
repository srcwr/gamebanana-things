Players select guns at the start of the round from ones placed all over the ground and battle from all sorts of crazy places.  There is a surplus of grenades at the top for anyone who can make it up there alive and there is a lone awp sitting below some suspiciously crosshair similar bridges.  Just don't be near that awp when one of the four security buttons gets pushed."
