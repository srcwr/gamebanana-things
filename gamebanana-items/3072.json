You have to wait the \"drop\" of the music, and the weapon start shooting :)\r\nI've created this gun for the map jb\\_vortex\\_dimension, but i didn't use it because it create bug with models (they pass through the floor). I think it isn't 100% done, it still some bug to fix, but i hope, you'll enjoy this gun ^^\r\n\r\nThe file is made with : .bsp .vmf, and the extracted file you need for .vmf (models, texture, and song).\r\n\r\nRaphi"
