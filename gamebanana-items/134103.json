	"_sText": "This map was inspired by the time when I visited the volcanic caves in Oregon. Although the map itself is nothing like the caves, my only goal for this map was to make a map with caves in it. I think it turned out fairly well since both teams have an equal advantage in their own way.\r\n\r\nI made it so the Terrorists have 1 more way to get into the caves than the Counter Terrorists do, but I put the lighting for the Counter Terrorists so that they could tell where they Terrorists were behind things such as rocks when the battle is taken above the caves.\r\n\r\nThis map is for upto 40 people. Although 40 would probably be a bit crouded on this map, it's worth a try if you have a server big enough for it. "
