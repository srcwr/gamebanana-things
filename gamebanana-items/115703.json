You'll be able to use any weapon since I've included a buyzone.\r\nI would say it's kinda simple in many aspects, but I personally find it quite entertaining at same time; and hopefully you will get hooked for many hours, too!\r\n\r\nIn fact, I firstly got this map from the following link:\r\n\r\n_http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/132702_\r\n\r\nI modified it and made a lot of changes so I could have fun with an alternative and more complex version. Just felt like sharing it with you guys (girls or w/e)."
