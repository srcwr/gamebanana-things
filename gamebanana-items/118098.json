All players spawn with AWP, knife, and Nightvision.  There is a button at the top of the map that dynamicly changes every round.  It does one of three things:\r\n1- Teleports all alive players to a knife arena (strips all players of all weapons and equips a knife.)  Th arena is set on snow and slippery ice.\r\n2- Chnages server gravity for the round and plays the benny hill chase song.\r\n3- ???  You get cake! :)\r\nThis is a beta version.  Please feel free to midify as you wish (Don't forget to credit, where is due.)  FYI, the button is a little bit buggy you may have to press it a few times to get it to work."
