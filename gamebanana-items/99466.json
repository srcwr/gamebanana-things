	"_sText": "I waited to long to post this map, this is my version of AA's Bridge Crossing, I tried to keep the top authentic looking, but added the underneath.  Lots of  things to play with and do in this map.  It is my first public release, and any comments would be greatly appreciated.  I used standard textures and a few things I designed in hammer myself.  We have play tested this map on our server for several months.  I think I have worked out all the bugs, let me know if there are any.\r\n\r\nanda big thanks to my friends who helped me play test this map :) ."
