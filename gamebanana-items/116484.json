It looks alot brighter ingame.\r\n\r\nBoth teams start off beside eachother (with no weapons) and you have to race to the end, Once you get to the end you can either pick up a gun and try to kill everyone else or you can walk through the kill portal to kill everyone still on the track and win the round. \r\n\r\n<b>Note</b>: the ramps might glitch sometimes and send you flying far which will hurt you when you land, just watch out.\r\n\r\n<b>Made by:</b> \r\nSGT_kick_ur_ass\r\n\r\n<b>Provided by:</b>\r\n<a href = http://www.haflifestorm.com>www.haflifestorm.com</a>"
