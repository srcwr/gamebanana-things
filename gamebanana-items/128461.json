I was hesitant to release this because its not my work, but I added some spawns and some servers want me to upload this so they can run piratewars with more people, but all the credit goes to Solid Snake.( And sorry the sign spelled solid snake wrong in the map a friend did that texture and he was retarded to mispell that name.)\r\n\r\nMap made a while ago releasing now\r\nSet for up to 30 spawns\r\nPlease stop by Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect..\r\n"
