	"_sText": "This is a Gun Game map made for up to 40 people. There are buyzones at spawn for both teams. \r\n\r\nWhen you start, you have 3 options of places to go, if you go to one side, you'll end up at a large pool of water with a vehicle at the bottom. Or you could go to the other side which has only vehicles. If you want to go inside the building then you just run straight in. There are stairs right by the door in the building which lead to the second floor and ulitmately the roof. \r\n\r\nThis map is relatively quick for gameplay and is excellent for turbo gun game.\r\n\r\nWith the map file that you can download, I included the .nav file plus screenshots of the map to view before opening it for gameplay."
