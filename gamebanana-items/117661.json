	"_sText": "Death Match - Traditional. This map is a flash back to the classics of death match; quake3 and the unreal series.\r\n\r\nThe map is a multilevel symmetrical indoor map. Spawn points are scattered all over the map. Guns are placed across the map. Health kits and armor in also in the map. In the classic deathmatch style you run around the map, killing people, healing, getting guns/ammo and getting armor. I have atempted to create a map so this can be done with the Source feel.\r\n\r\nTo play the map that way it is intended, it needs to be run on a server with respawn and weapon remover (guns are removed when they are dropped)."
