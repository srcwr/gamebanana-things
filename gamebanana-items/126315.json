I did my best to try and make a decent bhop map which I think I partially succeeded at but there's still lots of improvements to be done and I'd like your feedback to get there!<br><br>The map consists of 3 stages where 2 are really short and the third is just above the short timespand in which I did the map in about a minute and thirty seconds, give it a try and let me know what I can improve on :')"
