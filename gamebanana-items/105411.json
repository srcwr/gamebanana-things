If you need more player slots, let me know and I will make some more.\r\n\r\n10 is definitely the best amount of people to play with.  Too many people is just too crowded.\r\n\r\nIf you like the map and want more, tell me.  I also take some special map requests from clans.  If you are getting some weird error, tell me.  If you need anything else or want something tweaked then let me know, I will more than likely be able to change it.\r\n\r\nEmail: ace.asp@gmail.com\r\n\r\nCome play on this special server that has hosted my map:\r\n\r\n72.51.41.228:27015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA V2 will be made shortly with cell shading :D"
