	"_sText": "An industrial area with a canal running through the middle and sewer access to most of the map. Mostly outside with a number of large buildings.\r\n\r\nUpdate - de_Conduit_small: I have made the map a lot smaller by adding walls that block off one bomb site. The walls alternate in a similar way to cs_Havana(except there are only 2 possible paths). I also made the bomb site zones about half their original size. Also minor changes such as fixed cube maps."
