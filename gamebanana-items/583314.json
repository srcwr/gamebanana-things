This map was done since early january but only decided to post it now for no particular reasons...<br><br>Features:<br>-Broken NAV mesh making hostage rescue impossible (you'll got to remove the bad guys regardless)<br>-Raid-style map<br>-Extremely terrorists sided. If you're CT, You're <i>fucked</i>.<br>-OP basement for terrorists. again, if you're CT. You're <i>fucked.</i><br>-No 3D skybox so here's some realistic scenery for 1996<br>-Extremely wallbangable map. You can buy m249 on CT side to fight with the Ts op-ness.<br>-Cool features mentioned above.<br><br>I will not \"fix\" the \"problems\" you may have with the map. if you find one then I can guarantee you it is an intended feature."
