	"_sText": "Surf_aaaa is a map with 4 levels each with their own different tricks you must perform well in order to finish the map.  I did have lighting for it originally, but it was 32 megs with lighting so I decided to take that out.\r\n\r\nLevel 1 includes blades that, if you hit them, will teleport you back to the starting spawn. After that, you must surf upwards to get to the ramps that if you touch the water below them, you will die.\r\n\r\nLevel 2 includes a tricky ramp that pushes you upwards like a spring to the next ramp. Then you must start on the last part of level 2 which tests your ability to maintain speed.\r\n\r\nLevel 3 has a difficult pipe-like ramp that you must surf across. After that you have to use your jumping skills to maneuver to the next part of level 3. The last part of level 3 includes a long ramp that doesn't stop until you reach the pool of water.\r\n\r\nLevel 4 is the best of all 4 levels. The best way to win this is to shoot out of the tunnel through the left side and keep holding your left key to be able to reach the first ramp. To have enough speed to make the long jumps, you should hold the opposite key that you would normally use to surf with once you get to the small ramps that turn left or right."
