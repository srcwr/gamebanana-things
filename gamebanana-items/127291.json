	"_sText": "My second deathrun map with name: Deathrun_Wasteland . I think it is much much better than \"Janchiworld\" :) ..\r\n-Map have 25 traps\r\n-In map is two trail grenades (Of course, they are hidden in secret \"rooms\")\r\n-Used light_enviroment and env_sun\r\n-Used env_cubemap (textures looks more realistic)\r\n-3D Skybox used\r\n-On end you can choose from: 1) OLD (Very easy. You will be teleported to the room with guns...)\r\n2) HE (My favorite :) .. Inspiration was in map he_tennis .. you are on tennis court, T/CT is on opposite side of court and you are throving grenades over the net)\r\n3) KNIFE (You are on thin deck, under you is fire.. Simple knife fight...)\r\n\r\n.. Hope you will like my map .. Yes it is final version, but there still can be bugs or errors .. If you found any bug or error, type me a message here(FPSBanana) or on ICQ 232388503 .. Thanx .. Special thanks to Vojtoun and Rico"
