	"_sText": "I find most aim maps the same. By creating one on the top of a tower in the middle of a massive field, lit up in the black of night, hopefully this will stand out from the others. I know how to make skyboxes, but I found a completely black background much more interesting. There is a secret area, though it's very difficult to get to simply because it mucks up the gameplay. (I still haven't been able to get to it!)\r\n\r\nThis level plays like most other aim maps. It's very simple, but the black background can lead to stealth attacks, and there's a possibility of falling to your doom. (As with most of my maps :)\r\n\r\nA quick little blast, hopefully you'll enjoy it."
