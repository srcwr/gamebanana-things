	"_sText": "This map is originally based on same sort of style I made years back, but this more of a modern updated version and ive chucked in afew more things to make it just the extra bit more fun and rearanged things to make it user friendly.\r\n\r\nIn this map you have to choices either side, Maze. or Traps. For maze you must run through a big maze until you find the door to the inner court yard where you will meet up with other members of your team or other people from the oposite team, In the inner courtyard you have ak's and m4a1's and 4 scouts located on the top of the tower. For traps you must go through 6 traps without dieing then you are teleported to the inner courtyard, Once you get to know the maze it may be faster, but the traps are alot more fun and challenging. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nBy - X e d -\r\nproudly_canadian@hotmail.com\r\nxed666 <---- Xfire\r\n\r\nIf you notice any glitches or anything wrong with the map please let me know and i will fix it up asap.
