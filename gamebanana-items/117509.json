	"_sText": "This map is made for Death match. It DOES NOT work well in any other form of game play. There is over 50 spawn points (can't remember exactly how many though) and the map is set up so it can be played fair for both teams (meaning both teams have the same advantages and the map isn't one sided). There are ladders going up and down on the inside and outside of the 4 main castle-like towers. The middle tower has 4 ladders going up the middle of the tower which leads to the highes point of the map. From there you can walk along several different wooden beams to the outside of the map and shoot down from them. There is also many metal blocks set around the map for strategy. Anybody can access the middle tower by either climbing one of the main 4 towers or going directly to the middle one and climbing up it. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
