	"_sText": "Gg_cemetary\r\n\r\nRec Players: 12-18\r\n\r\nDark \"spooky\" feel, with 3 mausoleums located ontop of a hill in the center of the map and rows of gravestones near the spawns and on the sides of the map arranged perfectly. Theres 2 dried up reflection pools near spawn and small fountains on the sides. \r\nOriginally I had added a 3d skybox of dead trees but i thought it took away more than it added so i removed it. Theres already enough going on i didnt want to clutter the eyes.\r\n\r\nAbout the gravestones:\r\nMe and my wife play with a lot of folk, mostly on the westcoast gun game server (69.22.180.139:27015) and a few on my gg server (69.12.100.230:27015). Lots of good peeps and i had an idea to somehow include them in a map. On each gravestone there are names from the players we regularly play with and good friends on around 64 of the gravestones and 4 people including me in the mosoleums. Was quite a task but hopefully they all enjoy it. If your name wasnt squeezed in... uh... maybe next version? lemme know.\r\nThanks and enjoy!\r\n-Cheebs"
