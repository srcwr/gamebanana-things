I simply re-worked it to function as a bhop/course map, with permission.**\r\n\r\nA true classic in the zombie mod realm. I like the map, and I like jumping around on it, so I made this. Bunnyhopping isn't required to complete the objectives. Intended for servers with timers, which is also how I justified the bhop_ prefix. Please note that the timer zones **has to be where specified in order to prevent any glitching.\r\n**\r\n\r\nThis map uses a new non-linear completion system.
