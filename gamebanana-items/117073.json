	"_sText": "I created this map back in 2012 and only shared it at a real Australian \r\ninternet gaming cafe named Cyberhive (which the map is based on) - the \r\ncafe was really happy with the results but I've never shared itÂ  \r\npublicly until now (life got in the way and I stopped playing CS:Source \r\nuntil now when I realized hey it wouldn't hurt to share this map I spent\r\n hundreds of hours on to the world!). <br><br>I've made four variants of this map in total, each of varying sizes and this is the SMALLEST variant of the map - it's very tight so there's plenty of quick, instant action to be had. Check out the largest variants of this map: cs_cyberhive_sundown and de_cyberhive_night<br>"
