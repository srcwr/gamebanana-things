	"_sText": "A big change from all my zm_open maps. I think I was successful in making temperate and winter climates so I gave desert a try, I also think this map is a big success as well.\r\n\r\nI'd like to thank AceServ for hosting my maps on their server, and everyone who has played them and keeps telling me I did a great job. Thanks for the motivation guys! I'd never have gotten this far without you.\r\n\r\nCompared to zm_open_b3 there are so many changes it's hard to tell them all. But basically the Shed, Shelter (bunker), and Fort are still there."
