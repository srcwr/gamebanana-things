Please don't complain that I suck :] Hopefully this map is good enough to get onto an Official Zombie Mod Server :D\r\n\r\nThe next version (update) I will clean up the textures, such as adding grass, dirt, etc. and making the water more clearer and realistic. Also, I will also be making a button for the elevator so you don't have to wait for the elevator everytime someone goes up to it.\r\n\r\nWater Problems (Secret Area) Help -\r\nI know that sometimes you can't get out of the water; I added an invisible go-thru texture on the top of it so the water looks nicer when you swim in it.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to press \"SPACEBAR\" to get out. To get on the boxes, Hold \"W\" and keep pressing \"CTRL\" (Crouch) until you get on one. I will take the invisible go-thru textures off next version."
