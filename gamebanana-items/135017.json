It is designed to be gloomy and dark to give that slightly creepy feel. It has HDR lighting for this effect and volumetric fog. Took me a while to plan out the basic structure and then a week or so to add the detail and textures to that.\r\n\r\nThis ISN'T the finalized version, I will be working on the textures and adding more detail to the map, however I want to test the general layout first.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading."
