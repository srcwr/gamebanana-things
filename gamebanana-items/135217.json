Here's what I came up with.\r\n\r\nSeems perfect for \"stealth\" knifing, since its easy to get behind people.\r\nThough stealth isn't really the right word for it.\r\n\r\nIts really hard to show what the map looks like through pictures, and I can't do a video..  So basically, they fade in and out, though not totally clear.  \r\n\r\n"
