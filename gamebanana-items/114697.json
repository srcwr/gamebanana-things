	"_sText": "Training Yard is quick remake of first map I've ever made and never actually published. I was noob back then, so I decided to recreate map with proper technique. Map is compiled on -final settings with HDR and lightmap scale 2, so it looks nice like hell. I've also created custom overview and .nav file. Because of its size map is deagle only with 3 scout rifles in each tower. Hope you'll like it and enjoy it as I and my friends do.\r\n\r\nMap description:\r\n\r\n     - 24 Spawns\r\n     - Custom .nav File\r\n     - Optimization\r\n     - HDR\r\n     - Radar Overview\r\n\r\n\r\nand lot more... try out for yourself."
