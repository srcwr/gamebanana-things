The idea was to make a map that would be a lot of fun with 10+ players and lots of team communication. There's tons of places for enemies to be hiding and you never know when one might jump out of nowhere and attack you! Be sure to move in groups and have plenty of fun!\r\n\r\n**Instructions:** Extract the .zip file and copy the .bsp and .nav files into your Counter-Strike: Source map folder. This is usually under C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/(yourname)/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps. Enjoy!"
