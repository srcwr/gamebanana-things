	"_sText": "So, the story behind this map is this: For awhile, I was playing on a server owned by a clan called “United States Bong Team”, or USBT (currently defunct, AFAIK).  One night, we were playing on that classic “deagle” map (the one with the box maze and a walkway above it), which had been ported to the source engine.  I started complaining about how ugly it was, and the leader of the clan (p0stal) called me on it.  He said that if I thought I could make it better, that I should prove it.  This map is the result, with the addition of an overall USBT inspired theme."
