	"_sText": "Because scroll is as dead as you want it to be!<br><br>A scroll/kz map with gameplay that is mostly unique, featuring some jump ideas i do not see often or haven't seen at all before. The design revolves around themes i associate with solitude and loneliness. Main route should be around medium difficulty: technical but not hard on your strafes/perfs. There is also a medium-hard bonus made together with Flexlolo. Also some secrets sprinkled on top so you do not get bored quick! Intended for 100 aa, stamina, scroll, 250 runvel, etc.<br><br><span class=\"RedColor\">Be warned that medium/low graphics settings cause issues. This should in no way affect gameplay though.</span><br><br>Special thanks to avocado for testing it with me!<br><br>This map uses a lot of custom assets. I used your model and forgot to credit you? Leave a comment and we will fix that."
