I got the idea from the mfirst movie of Resident Evil 1, but theres pretty much no resemblence. \r\n\r\nI allow editing as long as credit is given to me and you. Credit has to be given where dued. If you use it in a map. Credit needs to be given. I hope you all enjoy. \r\n\r\nAlso theres the .bsp ... try it out as a little test. I've beaten it, its not too hard. Not too easy. Good Luck.\r\n\r\nAlso if you have a request for a map or pre-fab thats easy... or need help, feel free to message me. Thanks!"
