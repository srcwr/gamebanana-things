	"_sText": "This is my second release on fpsbanana.  I took the ValVe map de_nuke and miniaturized it!  I removed the whole underground area and bombsite B.  I gave the whole rest of the map a cartoonish texture.  I moved both spawns more towards the middle of the map then they are in the ValVe version.  There is a functioning bombzone and functioning buyzones for each team if you want to play with bots.  "
