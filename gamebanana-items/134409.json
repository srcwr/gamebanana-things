	"_sText": "By popular demand (hello GlassCannon ;) ), a 64 spawns version of my gg_deagle_factory map because that old version has 16 spawns only.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, 64 players on this map is probably too much but it allows you to run the map with as many players as you want.\r\n\r\nI also added buy zones, so it can be used as a regular Fy_ map.\r\n\r\nThis map was inspired by a CS1.6 map by TJF.\r\n\r\nHave fun and happy fraggin' !"
