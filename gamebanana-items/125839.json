	"_sText": "<span class=\"GreenColor\">_fix removes the gay start which makes nobody want to actually run this map, and also has some slight visual enhancements such as more going on in the skybox and slightly better lighting.<br><br>I would reccomend switching relinquished with relinquished_fix as nobody is going to run the original with that lame start. I wanted to correct this.</span><br><br>This is a map I have been working on for a while, the design is supposed to be reminiscent of omnific, my favorite surf map. There's 16 stages and they're designed to be done one after the other, but you can complete them all without having any pre-speed.Â  A good run on the main map is 2:20 and the bonus is very difficult and around 30 seconds long. I put a lot of love into the design of this map and tried to make sure every stage was totally different, hope you enjoy. - I did want to do more stages but literally couldn't due to complications with the brush limit. I essentially tried to make this like bhop_verbena but took a lot of the feedback from that map, particularly how annoying the 64s on the last stage were, and use that to make a better version both gameplay wise and visually.<br><br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-JQ6v47pdo\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
