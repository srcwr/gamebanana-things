There are explosives barrels, cars and other items, so try and kill your opponent in an imaginative way ;) \r\n\r\nThere is a secret chamber with an AK47, Deagle and grenade in it. \r\n\r\nThe big slabs of white tinted glass can be broken, however they are difficult to break. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it, and I hope to be playing it on servers soon.\r\n\r\n*Edit\r\nChanged the description and added some decent screenshots"
