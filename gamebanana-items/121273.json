I tried keeping the gameplay and architecture, to the best of my abilities, the same. Also, I fixed minor bugs in the texturing (texture stretches, no optimization). I slightly retextured and relit the map to improve it's overall looks. Also, I added a custom skybox produced by HIPSHOT.\r\n\r\nThis map was tested numerous times on a RPG deathmatch server and the results were all positive.\r\n\r\nI recommend playing this map on a server with 10 or more players, however it works fine on servers under that amount.\r\n\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n\r\n-RPG mod tested\r\n-DM mod tested\r\n-40 spawn points (20 T, 20 CT)\r\n\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<Fieldset>\r\n\r\n<b> \r\n\r\nThis map was tested on Zon3d | scoutzknivez |RPG deathmatch server. This server has updated RPG and DM working after the latest CS:S update. Come check them out!\r\n\r\nIP: 8.2.120.188:27015\r\n\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</fieldset>"
