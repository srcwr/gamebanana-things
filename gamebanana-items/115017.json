I Also Tried to see if I could eliminate CAMPERS :P \r\n\r\nChanges: Changed the map a little to try and make it more even for the CT's.\r\nCleaned it up a bit,  Since GZ_training was my 1st map, it really does look terrible in Hammer, So I decided to go over the whole map and clean it. No more Overlapping brush work etc etc \r\n\r\nAgain thanks to all the tuts on FBSBANANA. \r\n\r\n"
