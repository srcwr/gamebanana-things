Maybe this will be the final one.</i><br><br>The map contains a mixture of bunnyhop and kz. You should reserve an hour or more to beat it. For those who are extra bored, you can try hard mode (bonus 1) which has no checkpoints. It's not fair, but that's why it's a bonus.<br><br>Start and end zones (main & bonus) are marked with triggers (mod_zone_start & mod_zone_end).<br>"
