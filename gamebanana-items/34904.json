Though this very complex map is a real champion by quantity of oar doors and crossing narrow passes it doesn't confuse them! &nbsp;:-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted (more detailed and thematically pertinently than in original mapauthor's file).<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map author available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/163725\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also all your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:&nbsp; Spence (for fine designed and high detailed downtown-styled map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:&nbsp; BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),&nbsp; CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),&nbsp; Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>No \"tickee\" no laundry! :-)<br><br>"
