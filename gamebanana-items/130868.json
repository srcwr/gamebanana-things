So its actually doable if you have correct movements skill.<br><br>The map have 4 stages.<br><br>Stage 1, Cyan.<br>Stage 2, Green.<br>Stage 3, Purple.<br>Stage 4, Blue.<br><br>There is 12 items in total. 6 for humans and 6 for zombies. All items are unlocked on stage 4.<br>The map is kinda challenging and need good teamplay.<br><br>If you have any suggestion on how the map can be improve or any report you can send me a message on discord (m4dara#9181).<br><br>Special thanks to Unloze and Nide that allow me to test beta version on their public server.<br><br>Special thanks to Moltard for the global help around hammer.<br><br>Good luck and have fun!"
