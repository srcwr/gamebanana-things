	"_sText": "Trikz_cooperation is the first map trikz which has been created. It is through it that the team Trikz and Terracid have gained notoriety. This map using textures development consists of various rooms, each offering a mission to players. As its name suggests, this map was designed to be played at two minimum, in cooperation. The principle of each room is very simple: you must cross barriers by various means, to achieve a button, which opens the door, and you will therefore reach the next room. Like all such successors, this map calls on players to use their expertise in the jump to clear the obstacles."
