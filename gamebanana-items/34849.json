They feel here like the real owners... as a rats in the New York subway! :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Named.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/14098).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also share your game impressions with mates and friends ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   (happs) Christmas Turkey (for nice atmospheric and fine designed office-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nDidn't forget to take more DDT..? :-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 22.10.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Added Place Names;\r\n- Some other minor changes.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
