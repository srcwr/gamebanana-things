You can follow my WIP post to stay updated on the other game modes of this map I will be making(de, scouts, and zm).\r\n\r\n**It is important that you set mat_colorcorrection to 1 in console for improved visuals**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epic final stand on top of Mercy Hospital is now made for CSS!  I made everything from scratch (I did not port anything or copy and paste).  Feel free to leave constructive feedback!\r\n\r\n2/8/2012:\r\n\r\nThe scout version is now complete, you can download it [here](http://www.gamebanana.com/css/maps/163528 \"scout\")\r\n\r\nZM and hopefully de on the way!"
