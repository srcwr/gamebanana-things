If it's you, or you know who it is, please contact me. I am not a stealing asshole.\r\n\r\n<b>Goal of the map</b>\r\nSurvive. You are looking at a huge slope. At the end of the slope is a machine that constantly opens and closes. It will drop crazy things like cars, trucks and even huge containers. Your goal is not to get hit by them. It wouldn't really be confortable in real life, a huge container coming at your face, would it?\r\n\r\nAfter 2 minutes, doors will be opened in the walls and guns will be reachable. From that point it will be PvP.\r\n\r\nHave fun on this map. If you have any proposals, questions or critics, please message me.\r\nYou can flame on me whatever you want, I am at least able to seperate the constructivism from the retardism.\r\n\r\n/Helix"
