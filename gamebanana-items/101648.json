	"_sText": "\"Well hello there. As of recently I have been working on a remake of de_cpl_strike, originaly created by narby. The map has cal intentions and could even be possibly played this season is it beta testes/ tweaked for competitive play. As stated this is a beta, so pelease download it and give it a run, and comments/ issues will be looked into. As stated before if this map has not been beta tested for competitive play yet so it you think somthing is wrong it most likely will be fixed. Comments and such are welcome. All custom content was created by me, there is not that much.\" "
