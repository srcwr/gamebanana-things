	"_sText": "<span class=\"SelectedElement\">This is a converted map directly from the game Counter Strike 1.6 from Counter Strike Source. I redid all the textures, I think that for the arena it is quite good. If you want to use my map in yours, please ask permission. Since the map had some lighting problems, I added special brushes that block the light, because even through the closed brushes you can still see the light at the edges. Instead of the standard textures, I made the developer's textures, so that the map weighs very little, but is good to play and does not lag. Immediately upon spawning, each player will have 35 hep.</span><br><br>I decided to remake this map a little bit, as I was very much reminded of the time when I played this map back in Counter-Strike 1.6, when the two teams ran to each other with the words \"It's time to die!\" and started mass-cutting with each other"
