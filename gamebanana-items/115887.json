	"_sText": "UPDATED:\r\n\r\nWell, too much has been added to say. There's a few building sections added and a lot has been tweeked.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaporated the fur, because it covers them. If you only knew the plans they had for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so I only took a few screenies (but there is a great deal more to this map). It is centered around a parking structure with two floors, 4 cameras (3 from inside a defendable shack on the top floor), a sliding garage door that can only be accessed from inside (teamwork is crucial; have teammates watch the cameras and work the door to help out humans; or be selfish and just defend the upper level).\r\n\r\nThere is also a 3 story appliance store, with a defendable show-room (with camera and backdoor), an upper lounge, and an upper-upper patio. Beside the store, there is a large traffic wreck with plenty of fire and a decent (read; FAIR) camp spot. \r\n\r\nBeside this, is an office building that is still in construction (by that I mean, the upper floor is littered with boxes and mess, while the bottom floor is a bit more officey).\r\n\r\nAnd finally, there is a maze of suburbia with a few camp spots. It's medium sized map that tested well (in previous versions; this is the newest, and so far untested vesion). So, enjoy and play fair."
