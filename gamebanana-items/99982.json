Game strategies are improved because there are three \r\nHR routes now not just one. There is a back door, and a basement \r\nwith a sewer area now, which are the other two HR Routes. \r\nThe wooden fence which was transparent to bots is now a brick wall.\r\nThere are 95 custom textures/models, and a radar overview place-painted\r\nfor enemy troop movement intell when bots are used. The nav file was tuned\r\nfor the fastest glitch-free play possible.... ( note Hostages can't use ladders\r\nand have problems going up or down basement steps rescue the basement \r\nbots through the sewer and the upstairs bots anywhere upstairs)\r\n\r\nMap will play very well with Deathmatch mod aswell.\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the 2010 version of this map i suggest you delete it and download this one which has many improvements."
