	"_sText": "Gungame map, also works as a fight yard map. Comes with BSP, NAV and Read-me.\r\n\r\n- Buyzones included;\r\n- No weapons anywhere in the map;\r\n- Improved .nav file.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The screen shots make the map look like crap (because of the lightning), but when you play it, it isn't that bad. I'll might apply colour correction to the next version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map is a look-a-like to gg\\_deagle\\_assault, but we can't make a comparison between this maps. This is because my map has different boxes size (making paths with normal width and others thinner). This map is a variation of my gg\\_200glockbullets, this variations has NO breakable boxes, so this map works better for round games instead of gungame turbo deathmatch as my first idea was. I also hated to play my own map against the BOT's because there were not enough paths to run away from them (Playing 1 vs 10). I also made some camping spots, which are very small, but that are placed so that players can humiliate others.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Why name it gg\\_zeroglockbullets?**\r\n\r\nWell, as a tribute to its ancestor, as we don't have to break any box, I don't need glock bullets, so it's the zero glock bullets map :P\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I just hope you enjoy playing it as much I did ;)\r\nDon't forget to comment and rate it :)"
