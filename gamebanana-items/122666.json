(No, it is NOT the version on FPSB.) I was discussing remaking this map with Ryan and he revealed that he actually made it, and it was never meant to be released, hence the name test. Anyway, here we are about 4 years since the original map debuted, with a completely new redesign and remake. The map is a bomb-site oriented map consisting of 2 bombsites. The map will play well on DM and non-DM. This map is a first of a series of classic surf remakes, be on the look out for new ones.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nMap made for 66tick, untested on 100 and 33.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nInstall: Put the bsp into cstrike/maps folder.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nThanks goes out to:\r\n\r\nRyan Berkery, one of the co-authors of the original surf_test.\r\nSolidsurf\r\nMapping Junkies (www.mapjunkies.com)\r\nEtrigan, testing, emotional support\r\nTAG Servers (www.tagservers.com) for testing\r\nRyan S would like to thank Paper-Cut for the remake\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit Solidsurf.info for more great surf maps and surf mapping tutorials.</font>"
