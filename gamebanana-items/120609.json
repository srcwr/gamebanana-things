All cannons were provided by the following people:\r\nUberkirsche\r\n$ol!d$n4k3\r\nsmurfii\r\n\r\nIn this map you start in a room where you and your group have to get out of to get into the main playing area, or you can just go noclip to get out of the room.\r\n\r\nOutside in the main area tehre are several things to mess with. My favorite is the giant wheels that you jump in and roll around with. There's one hidden room that has a bit of a suprise in it for anyone who can get in there. \r\n\r\nwell. have fun!"
