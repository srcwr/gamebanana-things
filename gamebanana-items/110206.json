	"_sText": "This is more than just a Knife arena, it's who ever survives last! This map was designed to kill off thoes people that always run from you, almost everything is breakable and you will die if its by a person, spikes, fire, or you just ran out of time. The map will start everyone caged up for atleast 3 seconds, 30 seconds later the spikes will open up and try to force you into them, if thats not enough fires will spread threwout the map while people try to kill you. If you survive that far there will be a sceries of lasers that will pass threw, by then you should be about dead and ready for the next round. If you are the last one you will get 30 seconds to kill the last person before the floor opens up and kills everyone off... you will die, no matter what."
