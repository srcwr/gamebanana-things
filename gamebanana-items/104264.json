Everyone remembers the Temple from GoldenEye, right?\r\n\r\nAs my first Source map, I tried to get the overall feeling of the Temple. I know the lighting is kind of lame, and the texturing isn't perfect. But I think I brought CS:S and the Temple together well enough for a GoldenEye fan to appreciate.\r\n\r\nThere's a bombsite in the middle to keep the action focused, and the whole thing is pretty nostalgic. So give it a try, and let me know what you think."
