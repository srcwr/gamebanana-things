	"_sText": "OK so this is the next map in my new HS_ series. Im really trying to get this map type off the ground and make it noticible like surf and zm. This map is a run down garden/graveyard. There is a pool spawn (shown in screenshots) and fog along a pathway. There is a way to get out of spawn,but its secret but you should figure it out quick enough. There are buyzones for both teams once again secrets  :)\r\n\r\nThis map features:\r\n-Lighting\r\n-Fog along path and above certain water pools\r\n-Lasers in trap room (in screen shots)\r\n-Hover pushers (hint hint corners of BIG bronwn traproom box at mid)\r\n-invisible ladders\r\n-VERY reflective water\r\n-Good close range action ( I hope )\r\n\r\nWell I hope you have fun on this map and if you like my HS_ maps let me know so i can make more of these and have my own genre of maps under the map style selection area.\r\n \r\n-*-THANK YOU AGAIN SHEEPRIDER-*-\r\n\r\nTHANX\r\n\r\n-JARHEAD"
