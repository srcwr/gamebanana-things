Most of our players like de_dust2 so i decited to make an funyard map of it. \r\n\r\nThere are weapon dispencers where you can get AK47, M4A1, DEAGLE, HE and FLASHBANG. Also you can go on the roofs and get an AWP. Nav file included - i hope you have some fun, perhap the final will be released next month...\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n"
