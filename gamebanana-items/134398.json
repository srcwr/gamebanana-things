	"_sText": "This is a remake of F|4THeAd's cs_deagle5, but I used gg_deagle5_warehouse_fixed as a basis because I thought a warehouse would fit better with the theme. Anyways, the map is actually 2 deagles, one where it normally is, and another rotated 180degrees underneath the ground. Every 15 seconds they switch. The one visible goes underground, and the underground one becomes visible completely changing where everyone is in the map.\r\n\r\nIf you upload it to your server or modify it please post here or pm me! I'd love to hear about it."
