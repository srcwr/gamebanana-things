Since this is very old one, I'm going to remake it straight away after I finish my other jailbreak map projects. \n\nThis map contains a pool, an empty yard, medic, an armory and big cage. (And of course the hidden disco.)\n\nThe custom textures are made by Ryan.\n\nOh yeah, the custom sounds or textures are not packed inside the bsp file, since I didn't know about Pakrat when I made this"
