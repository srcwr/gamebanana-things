CT's spawn on one side, T's spawn on the other.\r\nOn top of the wall sits a small snipers nest, with a ladder leading to it from both sides of the wall.\r\n\r\nA rotating 'conveyor belt' sort-of thing surrounds the spawn areas.\r\nThe rotating platform is designed to travel from one spawn area to another, but can be used for drive-bys if you are inclined to do so."
