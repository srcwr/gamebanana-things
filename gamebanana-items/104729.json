But oh well, Here goes nothing, And I'd say, Nightvision does work pretty well.\r\n\r\nOnly 1 bombsite, and that's the little hut at the top of the hill, Terrorists start in one corner they can hide behind trees and smaller hills and make their way up.\r\n\r\nThis is the Tuesday, 14 March 2006 version, And that's the only version.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Some people were having download problems from here, So I uploaded the map again but in a .zip instead of .rar.\r\nEnjoy ^^"
