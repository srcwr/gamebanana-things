Don't let the time I spent on this map fool you though, as I worked very hard on this one.\r\n\r\nThere's two main areas to the map. First, there's an aboveground area with a radio tower of sorts in the middle of a storage yard. This area involves a lot of climbing and some barricading. Additionally, there's an underground office-type area filled with barricadeable rooms. This way both parties are pleased, and there's plenty of places to support up to 32 players, though 24 is probably ideal.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone asks, I created this from scratch with little to no reference material. That being said, I think both areas look pretty realistic and came out quite well. And yes, there is at least one secret to be found. ^_^\r\n\r\nOh, and before I forget, check out my gaming community @ <a href=\"http://www.ke0.us/\">www.ke0.us</a>! We have this map running on our ZombieMod server if you'd ever like to test it out.\r\n\r\nIf anyone ever feels like making a remake of this map, that's fine, but please contact me before you release it and be sure to include my name in the credits as the original creator of the map as I have here.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, thanks for downloading and enjoy the map! =D"
