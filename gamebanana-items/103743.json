The cts have to storrm the building from front, so to prevent them entering too quick, they must light the fuse on bomb affixed to door which will start a 5 sec countdown (if using mani plugin, it will show count down in screen) which then blows doors off hinges and smashes glass around it. \r\n\r\nthe terrorists start in rear car park and must rush facility.\r\n\r\nthe story if ne bothers with it:\r\n\r\nthe cts have discovered secret t nuclear facility and are sent to obtain evidence and shut it down. Ts have found this out through a leak and are trying ot beat the cts to the place. This gives the ts 3 options. \r\n\r\n1. destroy the nuclear waste and contaminate area, killing every1 over time.\r\n2. destroy nuclear missile evidence\r\n3. destory jet, so cts cant escape and alert others.\r\n\r\noh, and credits for the jet go to jmod, thanks \r\n\r\n\r\n****UPDATE*****\r\n\r\nfew changes to map\r\n\r\n-added new doors to nuke room for cts from spawn\r\n-less barrels\r\n-cant jump over fence\r\n-a secret in airfield ;)"
