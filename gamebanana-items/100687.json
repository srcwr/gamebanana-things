Its playable, but you might still find some bugs. Feels free to report them,\r\nbut i don't promise that i will fix them.\r\n\r\nDue to CS:Source's new fantastic hostage navigation style, I couldn't get the hostages working right.\r\nSo you can give yourself a nice tap in the back if you get them out of the house. But who would get\r\nthe hostages in this small map anyway?\r\n\r\nThere are startpoint for 32 players, 17 for terrs and 15 for cts (last thing i added were the spawns\r\nand i was very tired). The map is estate-style, but not estate on source. There are many routes and \r\nlots of stuff to kick around (and physics work hl2-style, not CS:S-style). I desinged this as a aim_\r\nmap in the first place so feel free to use it as a aim_, ka_ or anything else if you want. \r\n\r\n----installation:\r\nYou dont need the .txt file for anything anymore, as you just read it, but put the s_cs_nighthut.bsp \r\nand s_cs_nighthut.nav in you steam/steamapps/(your e-mail)/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave Fun.\r\n"
