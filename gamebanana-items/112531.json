GIDDY UP!\r\nanyway just got bored so i figured that id make a fun map.Even thoug I'd like to think that all my maps are fun but obviously not good enough to see it being played on servers..I got this map idea from anotehr map i played.Not sure if it was on cs 1.6 i think it was source though but i just got bored liek I said so I dont care. All you do is shoot down the square when u look in the air some will land perfect and some will be climeable(just jump on it when its down and u can get high. THere is a platform in the middle with 4 awps up top . Have fun \r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~LEAVE COMMENTS"
