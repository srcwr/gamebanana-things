	"_sText": "BETA VERSION\r\n\r\nHDR isnt enabled cause its just beta. also only one color correction atm and its spawns \"night colorcorrection\" so had to place lot of lights to gameplay better. ill try make indoors colorcorrection to next version. that will be less dark so i can remove those bad lights^^\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have idea to make that \"activating hologram\" (chamber 5) look better. atm is just lame teleport with 2 sec delay =/ Tell me ;)\r\nBig filesize is propably caused by making most of details to props. But this allows making more levels with higher amount of details so this is needed in future. I guess that filesize wont get much bigger in later versions unless I make more props.\r\n\r\nI hope that those shootboosters work now as they should. First time I tested them with friend they sometimes boosted him more than me. But I did some changes and now it seems to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSearching:\r\n-sound artist (some wordless songs as background musics/soundscapes)\r\n-texture artist (several different theme packs)\r\n-voice actor (some stuff via voice changer so it sounds like synthetic / computer like.)\r\n-video editor (map teaser videos)\r\n-Have some special skills that arent listed here? tell me.\r\n\r\ncontact me if u wanna help^^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nprefabs:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/907 -rotating door by SmJe\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3839 -mustang gt500 by NatalyaAF\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1267 -abstract beamtower by Lost\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/565 -escalator by freshinger\r\n\r\ntextures:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2342 -skybox by [-B-]\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2862 -portal 2 themed texture pack by reacz\r\n\r\nRest of models and textures are made by me.\r\n\r\nif I forgot something, please tell.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nIf u have any ideas to improve map, please tell me^^\r\n\r\n\r\nsubscribe if you like ;)\r\n"
