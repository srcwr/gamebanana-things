I figured instead of an ordinary dev map I'd use the hardly used dev textures. :P\r\n\r\nI wanted to just release a MiP instead of a beta map, sorry for posting it so late, I was expecting this to be a 2 hr job, but its carried on much longer than that.\r\n\r\nPlease give me some feedback , it's based more around fun than anything, so please take that more into mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/12fa2izipRs\"> </param> <embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/12fa2izipRs\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"> </embed> </object>\r\n\r\n\r\nATM I need to add a secret egg (or multiple) fix up a few brushes I don't like, possibly make a room ontop of spawn, make an obvious party room (where you won't be able to kill people but after a minute it'll blow up so rounds aren't delayed too much) and a few other things to increase overall gameplay and whatnot.\r\n\r\nI'll likely add some tunnels going underground / onto the side of the map."
