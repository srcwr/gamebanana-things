	"_sText": "This is a slight edit to the original bhop_arcane_v1 by panzer. This version has minimal gameplay changes, only a few tweaks to triggers and such to make them more consistent. This version of the map was made to be <span class=\"GreenColor\">speedrun friendly</span> as rng has no place in bhop. The name was voted on by several people in the SourceJump discord, so dont complain."
