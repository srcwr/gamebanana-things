	"_sText": "This is my edited enb pack that I made for Counter Strike Source. Enb is a simple config that people use to edit things of older games and modern games to make the graphics a little different or better. If you want more info on it you can search it on google or youtube and find things. This is my first post at moddb so I don't exactly know how things work here but I'm trying my best to look more professional when I clearly am not. So sorry if I get confused and don't know how to post things correctly. (Also in case ppl were wondering All the images you see are un edited they were all done with skins and the enb.)\r\n<br>\r\n<br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcQEmGpQgXE\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
