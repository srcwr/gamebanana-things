Apparently you did aswell =)\r\nBut now it's time to move on. We are already working on different projects these days.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to all our fans and supporters!\r\n\r\nSee you in another game!\r\n\r\nStarD00d & Magikus\r\nd00ds.com\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n------\r\nThis is the first release candidate of de_losttemple2, the 5th map of d00ds.com following de_rush, de_nightfever, de_cpl_fire and of course de_losttemple.\r\nThe temple, once a jewel of the mayan civilization, is located near a lake deep in the jungle. Beside the enemy forces you have to fight the mosquitos aswell. Smoke Grenades proved to be quite successful.\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n------\r\nAfter the discovery of a very well hidden secret inside a forgotten temple archaeologists all around the world are eager for more discoveries.\r\nThis time they are at the right place to look for but don't know it yet. They presume an entrance to a hidden chamber at spot A. However there is another entrance at spot B still undiscovered.\r\nA group of so called terrorists take their chance to make some quick profit. Little do they know there are special forces waiting in the area to turn the plan into a failure.\r\n\r\nLayout:\r\n-------\r\nThere are three main routes in the map: to the left a small temple at the cliff, through the swampy water in the middle directly beneath bomb spot A and to the right through the ruinous main temple hall. All three routes have in common that after taking over the hot spots the terrorists can storm both bomb spots. There is no specific A route or B route. However the counterterrorists can use three short routes to switch between A and B.\r\n\r\nThe map supports 40 spawns.\r\n\r\nAs always the map includes lots of custom textures, models, skybox and even sounds.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n------------\r\nDespite the use of numerous vegetation models performance turns out very well.\r\n3 GHz Radeon 9800 runs on 120 fps average and 95 fps for the worst spot.\r\nFor comparison the same system at dust2 runs on 110 fps average and 85 fps for the worst spot.\r\nIf you need more fps turn off the 3d sky with \"r_3dsky 0\".\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\n---------\r\nPlease send bugs & comments to\r\nc o n t a c t @ d 0 0 d s . c o m\r\n(remove the spaces)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to host the map for download or on your gameserver.\r\nOriginal download @ http://d00ds.com\r\n\r\nChangelog final:\r\n----------------\r\nmissing sounds fixed\r\n\r\nChangelog release candidate 1:\r\n------------------------------\r\n3d skybox added\r\nimproved lighting\r\nimproved lighting effects\r\nmosquitos added\r\nimproved waterfall\r\nbomb spot A collapses when the bomb goes off\r\nsome new vegetation\r\nmore dirt\r\nT Spawn requires no jumps anymore, improved round start on full servers\r\nrailing for the wooden bridge added\r\nradar locations\r\ntiny bug fixes\r\n\r\nAttention Server Admins:\r\n------------------------\r\nSince the map is larger than 16MB with all the custom content, put \"net_maxfilesize 64\" into server.cfg to allow download of the map.\r\nHowever with BZIP2, it is from now on possible to compress large files which the players must download before being able to play (e.g. maps...) This way you can reduce the size of the de_losttemple2 download from 49MB to 28MB. Also the file gets downloaded from your fast webserver. That allows an enormous saving of time at the time of the remote loading.\r\nJust follow these easy steps:\r\n* Download the file \"de_losttemple2.bsp.bz2\" @ http://files.ingame.de/counterstrike/gameserver/cstrike/maps/de_losttemple2.bsp.bz2\r\n* In your server.cfg set \"sv_downloadurl http://www.yourURLgoeshere.com/cstrike\". (insert your own domain name)\r\n* In the public_html directory (default) of your webserver create a new folder \"cstrike\" and a subfolder \"maps\".\r\n* Place the file \"de_losttemple2.bsp.bz2\" in the folder \"cstrike/maps\" on the webserver via ftp.\r\n* Keep in mind you still need to install the map de_losttemple2.bsp on your gameserver as you would normally do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Magikus & r00t for pre-beta feedback!\r\nThanks to Die Maulw√ºrfe for the closed beta test!\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out our other maps like de_losttemple, de_losttemple_pro, de_cpl_fire, de_nightfever and de_rush @ http://d00ds.com !\r\n\r\nStarD00d & Magikus\r\nd00ds.com"
