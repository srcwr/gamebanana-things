This map was mainly made for RPG servers for 1on1 scout battles and such (e.g. noscoping) I'm sorry I do not know who made ScoutzKnivez. This map can also be played on deathmatch... a lot of fun.\r\nScoutzKnivez_Arena = SKA\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n*Edit*\r\n\r\nAs of June 2nd, 2008 little glitches and bugs have been fixed, and the new file is out named scoutzknivez_arena_fix\r\n\r\n============================="
