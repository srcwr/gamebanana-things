	"_sText": "Originaly the idea came from a friend of mine who said and I quote \"make an island where the cts bring on shore and the ts are in a forest\".\r\n\r\nWell after having ideas of my one this came up, a map where the terrorist beggin in a house made of logs, and the counter-terrorist are on boats.\r\n\r\nI made this more real than the other maps, adding mountains (somewhat like spikes) a skybox, and environmental light.\r\n\r\nIt as a buyzone, but nothing else, making it a map for battle only.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, I don't think this is one of my good maps, since i made it in a short time and with few test, that is why i decided to make a version 2, with a bomb/defuse game more improved, as such, i will make more considrable space, since i wasted much on this map. I will add a second island, better sand, add more nature props, add a more irregular forest and house, and more plausable objects and barriers. The intend is to make a real life mission, so you can have fun in fantasise, so for this version, consider only that."
