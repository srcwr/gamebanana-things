I tried to make something vaguely similar to that in playstyle, not sure I did that but whatever. Yes it's another strafe map and yes it's using dev textures. Maybe eventually I'll finish the project I started of a map longer than 30 seconds. Maybe not. Enjoy. Or don't.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, there's a bonus level that's genuinely incredibly shit just for AM.<br><br>"
