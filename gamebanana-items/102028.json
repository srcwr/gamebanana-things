I am waiting for\r\nsuggestions for making the final version\r\n********************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\nRemake of de_dust2 for Counter-Strike Source\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nAuthor: _Laur (popa_laurentziu@yahoo.com)\r\nThanks to Maf|a for informing me about the request of\r\nthe gamers to make this map for Source.\r\n\r\nThe map has been built from scratch, even if it is\r\nalmost identical to de_dust2 made by Valve.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nSeveral things have been added to the map, some\r\nof them are obvious, others could be hard to spot:\r\n3 examples of things harder to spot.:\r\n   --- the small hole that leads from the tunnel\r\n     to Bomb B. You must destry the bricks to enter.\r\n\r\n   --- to enter the house at \"Long side\" you must\r\n     break the door.\r\n\r\n   --- the wooden plank at the middle stairs\r\n     has 200 hit points.. you can destroy it.\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere is an insignificant bug at the CT base that\r\ncan easily be ignored for now.\r\n"
