I will be\r\nadding 2 on 2 and a bigger version\r\nof this map. This map is mostly \r\nonly work on the detail of the map.\r\nThe detail took me a while but I think\r\nit took the role of a Castle Courtyard.\r\n________________________________________\r\n   ~  ~  ~  Installation  ~  ~  ~\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n1.
