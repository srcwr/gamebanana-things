	"_sText": "This is my first fy map. This was for a design battle to come up with good fy maps. hoc is short for house of cards. You are given a full ammo load, kevlar and helmet, a deagle, and knife, so grab a weapon and start blasting. There is a buy zone in the middle, but it does little good, since everying stripped at the start of the next round. So everyone starts back off equal again. There are 20 player starts each side, so a this a 40 player map. Awps and auto sniper are place out of the way as to be a little harder to grab. There are 22 weapon per side. Could be a good gun game map too. While the map looks nice, game play could be stonger. I may do a better remake one day. "
