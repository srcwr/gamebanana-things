From there you can get onto the roof.\r\n\r\nIt provides dynamic gameplay and is designed for up to 30 players. It has buyzones so every weapon is possible. \r\n\r\nJust try it !\r\n\r\nVisit us at http://www.headcrabcompany.de.vu or watch the map on our server:\r\n\r\nip: 85.214.28.206:27015\r\nPassword: hcc"
