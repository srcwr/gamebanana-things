	"_sText": "One day I was sitting at my PC and I suddenly had an idea for an original level. Taking advantage of the physics engine, I created a level out of blocks which could be demolished. Randomly spawned blocks pummel this structure until it collapses, as people desperately run about on top of it. Death is guaranteed eventually... but who will be the last man standing?\r\n\r\nSadly guns had to be removed, as it mucks up the physics. If it becomes all jolty and slow you have to end the round in some way.\r\n\r\nmp_restartgame 1\r\n\r\nEnjoy this map! I have always been interested in physics and hopefully more levels like this will be out soon. There have been loads of versions of this level, though this is one of the most balanced. (Originated from my old GpX_Smash levels, but then my clan changed)"
