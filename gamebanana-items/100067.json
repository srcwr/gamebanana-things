The environment outside the house isn't a realistic image of the real world but more of a stripped down version.\r\n<br>For obvious reasons I couldn't do the whole environment surrounding the house. \r\n<br>...Also more cover added in some places.<br>\r\n<br>About Playing with Bots: More or less playable NAV-file is included in archive.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Happy Frags and Good Luck!"
