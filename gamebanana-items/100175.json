	"_sText": "<strong>CS_MOTEL</strong> by Hightower (released February 2009)<br><br>\r\n\"The mapper did not release one but four versions of his map. It is available as a hostage or defuse map and both are available in day or night versions. With an ugly map it's making no sense, but as the map is pretty good, very realistic and is based on a rarely seen location, these little variations around a common theme are a nice idea... If you're looking for large urban chaotic combat map, well, look somewhere else. If you're looking for an infiltration map where danger is behind every door, check this one!\" - from map review at Netday.be<br><br>\r\nHere is a daytime version of map. Nighttime version you can download <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/177487\">here</a>.<br><br>\r\nSee also both Bomb/Defuse versions of map by original author: <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/177486\">de_motel</a> and <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/177488\">de_motel_night</a>.<br><br>\r\n<strong>NOTE: <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3234\">Here</a> you can also download the hand-tuned .nav-file (Navigation Mesh for Bots) for this map, because the one included in original .bsp-file simple auto-generated nav is NOT FULLY playable!</strong><br><br>\r\nGreat Thanks and Good Luck!<br><br>\r\nP.S. For expansion of an outlook and comparison of feelings I recommend also will examine other interesting views of the similar location - <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/43452\">cs_motel</a> by Soctom, <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/141224\">de_motel_b4</a> by Garten and also the map <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/106757\">cs_motel_tws</a> by The Wormhole Studios."
