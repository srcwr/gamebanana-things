	"_sText": "My last map for a while, a simple but pretty 45-50s (wr) strafe map, although to get a time that good you'd need to pull off some skips, a couple of which are hard. I just wanted to make something more light-themed since my last 4-5 maps have been dark/gloomy. Also has a 30s ~ strafe bonus. Didn't spend too long making this, but I still put some love in and I think the ending is really cool.<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>"
