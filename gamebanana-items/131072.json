	"_sText": "Greetings.\r\n\r\nI come to thee with a new map after 2 years of procrastination!\r\n\r\nI usually create maps for games I'm playing at the time, and currently I've been playing a lot of CSS:ZE.\r\nWhat shocked me was the horribly unbalanced maps, leaning to the favour of the survivors, with countless of blockades for the zombies. So I took it to my personal mission to create a map that leans to the favour of the zombies.\r\n\r\nSurvivors have a few hold-positions after which they can continue with the escape again. The timers for survivors are long, but for the zombies very brief. This is to ensure that the zombies get enough chances to attempt infecting the survivors, and the survivors won't get too big head starts at each blockade.\r\n\r\nThe map takes the player from a trainstation to a trainyard, from there through sewers to a canal. From a water-powered laboratory to another and from there to the allyes of a small town, and it all climaxes into venturing to a dark catacomb - WATCH OUT FOR THE SUN!!\r\n\r\nReviews and constructive comments are more than welcome! I'd be happy to alter the map and make more versions to satisfy your needs whether it was tweaking a scene or extending the map, just share your ideas!\r\n\r\nI'd also appreciate if you posted IPs for servers that are running the map."
