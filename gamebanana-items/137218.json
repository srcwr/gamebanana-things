It's small map made for GG gametype. This map has 32 spawns, so it's full of action when there are 16 players on both teams.\r\n\r\nI wasn't even so sure if I have to make spawns like these to make it to work in GG, but after testing a little bit - it should be totally fine. I also tried my best with adding default textures - I am not the greatest man with adding textures around the place.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Vmx for giving some advice.\r\n\r\nAnyways, **happy fraggin'**."
