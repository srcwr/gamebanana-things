This map was created with \"surf for the sake of surf\" in mind, so you won't find a jail or anything encouraging combat.\n\nType: Linear\nTime: ~1:40\nFilesize: 52MB (unzipped) 14MB (zipped)\nStyle: I'm told this is like 2005 surf, I'll let you decide.\n\nFinal note: I apologize for that water bug in the credits room, I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it."
