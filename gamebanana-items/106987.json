My third map \"Aim_Depot\"!**\r\n\r\nIt's been forever since I've uploaded my second map \"[Awp_dustwars](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/170176 \"awp_dustwars\")\",\r\nso I decided to open Hammer Editor and start on something.. AND BAM, this map was created.\r\n\r\nThe map is a depot/storage area.\r\nThe map contains alot of cover and some nice spots for gunfights. The map is fairly balanced. The map has a dust theme.\r\n_Feedback is always welcome._"
