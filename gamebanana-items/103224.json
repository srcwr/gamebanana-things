It turned out that most of the time the bombb was planted at A and not at B. I tried to make bomb spot B more interesting and gave more options to approach it: I added\r\n\r\n-truck added for more cover\r\n-stairs from the floor of Cafe Baltic to B\r\n-ladder at one of the trucks, you can use to get to the roof of B\r\n-a second ladder to the quadratic roof\r\n-ladder at the staircase to the roof\r\n-moved van, so you can get through at bove sides\r\n\r\nFurther changes:\r\n\r\n-created a real pool at A. Players can stand in the water. Bomb can be planted underwater. By ducking you may try to hide underwater.\r\n-created a hole in the red roof\r\n-used playerclip to avoid that players get stuck\r\n-many optimizations (changing passable appartments, so you can't look through; removed the most unnecessary appartments)\r\n-few details added.\r\n-includes 2*64 spawnpoints\r\n"
