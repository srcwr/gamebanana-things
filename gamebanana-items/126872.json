It doesn't look exactly like it, and i don't want it to; but that is where my inspiration came from.\r\n\r\nI haven't been on in a while with school and all. But I was going through old maps when i decided to fix some old projects. Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nBUG UPDATES\r\n==================\r\n- Fixed the spikes that never went down, and the wall that never kills you. I also tweaked some traps that didn't really affect you as much.(6/16/12)\r\n- Fixed the blocks and blades that did not affect you.(6/18/12)\r\n-Fixed more bug traps and glitches.(6/29/12)\r\n- ALL known bugs are fixed as of now (12/8/12)"
