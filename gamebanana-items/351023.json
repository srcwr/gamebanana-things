It's intended. Really.</div><br><br>PS! If you are having troubles with people downloading the wrong map from the server eventho you have deleted and cleared the old map from the server then it is most likely stored in the fast dl cache which you have to clear, if you don't have access to clear it then contact the people that run the fast dl and have them purge the file as it can take a while for it to disappear automatically."
