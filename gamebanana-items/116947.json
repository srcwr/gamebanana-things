On the lower level there is very little cover but almost complete darkness so you have to watch carefully for enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease list improvments for this map so i can add them to my future maps\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy \r\nthank you\r\n\r\nDr.A.0\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\" size=\"3\">*Do not copy, remake, or redistribute without author consent*</font>"
