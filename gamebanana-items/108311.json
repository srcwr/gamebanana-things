The map originally had mines that if you walk over them u would blow up but i removed them although may add them in as a new type of gamestyle if people wish.\r\ni recommend about 12 - 24 players \r\nthere is no nav file although chiz may nav it soon im sure the default nav will work fine  \r\nI know it looks weird with a mixture of cartoonish textures and real textures i tried to model some cars for this but i could not get them to work in game or texture properly sorry."
