	"_sText": "Aperture Science now operates a prison facility.\r\n\r\n24 Guard Spawns and 40 Prisoner spawns for a total of 64.\r\n\r\nEnergy barriers malfunction in 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nSwitch in the corner operates platform. It lowers. Use it like big cage.\r\n\r\nEverything is in the BSP.\r\n\r\nScreenshots are old.\r\n\r\nScreenshots don't show the best area. :P\r\n\r\nI didn't get to put everything I wanted in here. I may make a v2 eventually.\r\n\r\nI will set up a server for this sometime this week.\r\n\r\nI know that the metal walls look like they're covered in oil but I'm tired of working on this.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy. This was a lot of work."
