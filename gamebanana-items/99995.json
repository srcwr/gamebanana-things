Rescue the hostages inside and guide them to safety. There are many entrance points in the map and a few different ways to vacate the hot zones which should hopefully make the gameplay less static and more interesting. In the hallways,  close quartered combat is an issue, so a shotgun may be beneficial in this map. However, because of how big the map is any gun and play style should certainly work. \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n===========\r\nMike Reinerz, Bill Koch (beta testing)\r\nSamuel Villareal (guidance)"
