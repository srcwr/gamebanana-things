	"_sText": "**UPDATED 17.04.12\r\n!!!Fixed all bugs!!!**\r\nMap was created for Jail Mod, based on de_dust2, designed like cs_italy for public likers ;) It was my first map in SDK. Has set of positive responses. Therefore I want to share that map with you. Borrowed some elements from other maps, special thanks to them. On a map is available minigames, 4 rooms, football, a punishment cell, a room for !lr, hospital, a defense hall. Enjoy a map, thanks for your attention."
