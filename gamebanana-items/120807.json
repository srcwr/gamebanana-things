There is two secret rooms in the map, one for T and one for CT, good luck finding them ;-)\r\n\r\nYou are more than welcome to join us at: 217.163.30.167:27015 - [DK] Hoejhus 24/7 |FFA - 100 TICK!|\r\n\r\nYou can also just join our SteamGroup: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HoejhusServer\r\n\r\nI hope you will Enjoy the map and I hope to see you soon on the server! ;-)\r\n\r\nNB! NB! NB!\r\nThis is not as big as the old DoubleMix I made. I found out some servers had problems running my map because it was to big. So now it should work. I also fixed some \"texture\" errors. I decided to delete them so fare, until I'll find out the problem. Enjoy! ;-)\r\n\r\nYou can still download my old DoubleMix_v1 - Here: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/86738"
