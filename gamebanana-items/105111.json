I wanted make it like original, so I mostly didn't work on map design layout.\r\n<center>What's new?</center>\r\n* HDR, Cubemaps\r\n* Optimisation (Nodraw, func_detail, Hint\\Skip) (now fps is in 3 times more with hdr (60-120) and in 6 without (120-160))\r\n* 36 SpawnPoints! (earlier 32)\r\n* Some nodes for .nav file\r\n* A little texture remade (I remake some textures just to look globally better, but not seen at all)\r\n* Remade light a little (Constant = 1000)"
