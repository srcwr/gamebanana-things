	"_sText": "A medium sized bhop map for CS:S. This took about a month of on and off work. It has basic features like spikes, boosters, and of course bhop blocks. The reason it's called bhop_dood, is because I wanted to make a map with a similar name to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/192397\">bhop_dord</a>, but be different entirely. I know \"d00d\" is an outdated term, but I like it. Also, in Hammer, the map looks like \"dUUd,\" which is \"d00d\" with cut off zeros. Please rate the map after you play it!<br><br>Don't have CS:S? Get it for CS:GO <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/192787\">here</a>.<br><br>Re-Uploaded October 30, 2016."
