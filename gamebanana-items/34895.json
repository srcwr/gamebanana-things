Also many not accuracies in other pathways were allowed.<br><br>Well... bots use all possible ways now. And they are perfectly guided in the management of modern manufacturing enterprise :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by mapauthor included in original archive and available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/160123\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: catfoOd (for very realistic and fight-friendly atmospheric industrial map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>It's not a raiding, it's simply a scheduled inspection! :-)<br><br><i><span class=\"RedColor\">P.S. In addition to the NAV-file the archive also contains a minimap for the radar (which was not presented in the original release of the map).</span></i><br>"
