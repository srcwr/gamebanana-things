	"_sText": "This is a small aim map spawning you will an m3 and usp with full ammo, and a knife.  There is one deagle on each side, on top of the tallest box on the elevated platform, you spawn with ammo for it, so if you can get it, you will have full ammo. But be careful! Its a small map and making the necessary series of jumps to get to the deagle can be difficult. Its a small map, with plainish textures, nothing custom or amazing to the eye, just good, fast, balanced gameplay. Should be played with normal 800 gravity.\r\n\r\n-Enjoy!"
