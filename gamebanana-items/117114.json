	"_sText": "This map is a Deathmatch style map, and can be also a Minigame map to some people. Why I could not decide between the two is mis-categorizing. \r\n\r\nThis is my first actual map release on Gamebanana. But, this is not my first map. The first map I made was for Garrysmod.org (Citadel Fight)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this map. Took around 22 hours to create, and I was inspired by all the effort I put into this map. \r\n\r\nPlease comment on my Steam Community profile if you encounter major bugs and issues: not minor issues.\r\n[http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamewarden](http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamewarden \"Flame Warden's Steam Community\")\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this unique style CSS Map. Yes, there is no buyzones.\r\n\r\nEdit: There is a typo in the description, you can easily fix it (if you really have to...)"
