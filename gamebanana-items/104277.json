This map is small and rounds can be extremely short but the map itself has high detail and destructable objects.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay itself is pretty fun if you're into CQB maps, and noscoping matches can be very fun to play. \r\n\r\nPlease give feedback on this map, but I probably will not update it as it takes a very long time to compile."
