	"_sText": "This map was originally made by ThePredator2 and then Ggodd2 and I figured we could rescue a great map. The original map was 5-15 fps. We brought it out of the ground to a 50-100 fps. We re textured the whole map to fit it and the lighting was brightened. \r\n\r\nThePredator2 had a back of the house already made in his zombie_mansion_atnight_beta3 map, but never had it so you could access it. There are 5 ways to get back there and it looks pretty good. \r\n\r\nIn this version everyone starts in the maze and runs for their lives to get to the mansion. The gates are locked so SHOOT THEM OPEN!!! :)\r\n\r\nWell I hope you all enjoy what ggodd and i took a good 3weeks to fix and revamp. This map will be featured on the -=GHS=- Server. Hope to see you there!\r\n\r\nP.S. There will be a v2 to fix some minor glitches.\r\n\r\nP.S.S. You can find v2 <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/71294\">Here</a>."
