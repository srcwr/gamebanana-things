	"_sText": "ZM_Rundown is a very realistic/detailed map. I made it with all kinds of gamers in mind. The map is very well lit but its also optomized so that the gamers with bad gear can play the map just like ones with super gear. The map consists of 5 enter-able buildings (not including spawn); two of which are houses. Each part of the map will have its advantages but also a balenced disadvantage. the map is made to have hours of enjoyment and hopefully that will be true to those who play it.\r\n\r\nLooks like the video might not happen anytime soon.  I come to realize the apto update demo smoothing is just to much of a pain until they get it fixed.  I'll post a video when its fixed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNote i'm also looking for some more feedback on this map.  I tried to put alot of detail without overloading it.  "
