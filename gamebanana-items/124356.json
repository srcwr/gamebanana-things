Can be beaten legit/400vel but whether it's enjoyable is another thing.\r\n_Can you find all the hidden marks?_ ;)\r\n\r\n- **Anti-aliasing might cause weird white lines. You have been warned.**\r\n- Fps drops? Don't like how the map looks? **r_3dsky 0** is your friend!\r\n- The underground part is not there to annoy you with 64-unit jumps. In fact, you can beat it without ever doing them. Perhaps your route needs to be changed... Who knows, maybe it's faster to do them on different modes...\r\n- **Server owners**: Starting and ending zones are marked.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n====================\r\n**Wondering how things were made? Afraid of cyber police knocking on your door for DECOMPILING the map?**\r\n\r\nDon't worry, \r\nyou can download the entire thing from [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/142067828/download/bhop_aamu_sauce.zip \"Source\")!"
