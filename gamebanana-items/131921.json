Players now start outside on the streets. Shoot the padlock to gain access to the maze and find your way to the mansion before you become a zombie.\r\n\r\nTHINGS I HAVE ADDED/CHANGED:\r\nMausoleum/Church building.\r\nSewer system.\r\nNew player start.\r\nWalls around the map.\r\nRain/Storm noises (Courtesy of Robtronic).\r\nNew room to the left of the mansion.\r\nupdated the attic.\r\nAll doors open backwards to allow barricade creation.\r\nThe light environment is a dim blue to give it that nighttime glow.\r\nSome new texturing around the map."
