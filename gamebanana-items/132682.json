Enjoy!\r\n\r\nSomebody had stated there were a lot of vending machines. Well theres a story behind why. This little town has no running water, which is why all the machined vend water, and why the toilets still have poo in them.\r\n\r\nI didn't make this final since I am considering making it a little larger. \r\n\r\n\r\nChanges from v3\r\n* Added env_cubemaps to get rid of that \r\n   nasty green glare on weapons\r\n* Removed playerclip from above fence and added \r\n   rock texture to improve realism  \r\n* Added a doorway in an \"impossible\" room outside.\r\n* Widened doorway \"                                            \"\r\n* Changed sky model\r\n* Made it more awesome"
