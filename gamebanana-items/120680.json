	"_sText": "– Hi! I present to you my map “fun_testroid_boxik” for \"Counter-Strike: Source\" – a „fun” type of map, very small, with ultrashort and hot battles.<br>Here are some physical destroyable objects (a wall and three types of pillars), made by myself.<br><br>At the beginning it was a very simple map for testing.<br>But a good friend saw the map and tried it. After this he said that he want \"to live\" on it and to call everyone to be guest here.<br>Well, yeah, I edit it and will give them this pleasure. -))<br>I am game developer, but in such way I accumulate experience in level-design and keep fit.<br><br>Notes: Fun map (atypical maps that can combine several types of gameplay, but often it is funny or just wacky maps, made for fun).<br>------------------------------------<br>Background story of the map:<br>An extremely important mission for survival and domination!<br>- Special Forces and terrorists at the same time came to the public WC. Oops, surprise!<br>However, everyone wants to make a shit.<br>But someone is sitting on the toilet, making everyone to wait outside.<br>Oh shit!<br>Now have to figure out who first will remain to make a shit in comfort.<br>------------------------------------<br>Maximal number of players on this map: 32 (real players, or 31 bots &amp; 1 real player).<br>But is desirable no more than 8 players (real players, or 7 bots &amp; 1 real player).<br>Recommended 6 players (real players, or 5 bots &amp; 1 real player).<br><br>Success and have a good hunting! :)<br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6jlsFjpOSo\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
