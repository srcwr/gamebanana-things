	"_sText": "Introducing a Bank Robbery\r\n\r\nSituation\r\nThieves (Terrorists) have taken over G.N.B. (Name inspired over Goliath National Bank) and had taken hostages. Negotiations have been futile. We (Counter Terrorist) have secured the perimeter, and no one can escape without us noticing. Your objective is to Rescue the hostages by any means necessary. Our satellite reveals that the robbers are all spread out in corridors as general surveillance, a back alley providing guard from the Back doors, others are located inside the vault taking the money and a few are holding the hostages, so expect heavy fire as soon as you get there.\r\n\r\nGame play\r\nIt’s a Bank situation, but it’s a slightly different game play than usual CS games. In here Action is instant. All CT start at the entrance with an option to buy weapons, However the Terrorist team are all spread out over bank (Some start in corridors as general surveillance, a back alley providing guard from the Back doors, others are located inside the vault taking the money and a few are holding the hostages). The hostages are just a few feet away, yet its not as simple as rushing in as that ends up in death, so CT have to fight and try to flank using other entrances to the bank.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration came from having watching a few bank robberies movies, and the fact that I have never played a bank map in here, so it looked like an interesting idea to make. I am very happy with the results\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nDifferent spawning points for Terrorist\r\nHostages are relatively close to rescue zone, yet it still can be quite challenging to still rescue them quickly\r\n\r\nCapacity\r\n24 vs. 24\r\n\r\nRelease 1.01\r\nUpdates. More optimized, should run smoother\r\n\r\nRelease 1.02\r\nFixed an issue near the vault in which it was possible to see into the ''Nothingness''\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease comment and report bugs etc\r\n\r\nIf you take this map for your server online DONT FORGET TO PM ME YOUR I.P. address so I CAN JOIN along!\r\n\r\nMore maps from me to come\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to 3kliksphilp for his support, guidance, and tutorials at http://3kliksphilip.com/index.html\r\n\r\nLook at the screenshots and try it!\r\n\r\nInstallation, just paste the .nav and .bsp on your maps folder for counter strike source\r\n\r\nDefault should be Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\Account_Name\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n"
