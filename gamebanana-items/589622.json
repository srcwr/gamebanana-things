But since i recently decided to upload it to the workshop. I went ahead and made a few changes/fixed bugs. Updated: - Added 4 Secrets! - Increased spawn points to 42. - Added 90 sec spawn kill. - Fixed a few bugged textures. - Fixed invisible wall at the pyramid. - Rotated the boats on the last course. - Changed the size on the minecart damage. - Changed the ladder in the KZ room. - Fixed so you cant jump up on the mountain walls at the start. - Moved some ore. - Changed the wall in the nether skeleton area. - Removed a sign at the start.
