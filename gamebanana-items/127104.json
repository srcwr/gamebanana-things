	"_sText": "The map contains 22 pushable traps, and one small obstacle, which should be fairly easy to pass. 48 CT Spawns, 2 T spawns.\r\n\r\nI didn't really like how this one turned out. The traps in themselves are fine I suppose (though I love the cannon trap), just don't like the way it looks really. Need to make a nice and bright map.\r\n\r\nAs usual, if there are any broken traps or things that need changing, just comment and it'll be fixed promptly. Should be fairly bug free.\r\n\r\nMade for steamgamers.com deathrun server, 66.150.121.71:27015."
