Each cell has a individual open/close, as well as a mass cell open in the room outside the armory (CT Spawn). and after 60 seconds the cell doors will auto open. so dick CTs cant rune the game for you any more!\r\n\r\nWhat got fixed?\r\nMajor crash bug on map spawn\r\nWhole underground Lab secret\r\nSoccer field\r\nEating area\r\nCells can now be closed\r\nGuns can no longer be spammed\r\nFixed crash on map spawn with 10+ players"
