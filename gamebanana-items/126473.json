I decided to make a map which uses aspects of the design of kz\\_synergy\\_x from 1.6 because I really liked it and that's what it has become. \r\n\r\n### This map features:\r\n\r\n- a varying bunnyhop and climbing journey\r\n- 4 levels with increasing difficulty\r\n- 1 unique bonus level\r\n- a longjump room with jumps from 240 to 272\r\n- a relaxing song at the end of the bonus\r\n- custom particles\r\n- much fun\r\n\r\n### Songs:\r\n- start: [John Murphy - Surface Of The Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFvX1a7Yxh4 \"link2\")\r\n- end: [Kaj. - Journey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRe9UmpOWys \"link1\")\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you will all like it and enjoy playing this map. Feel free to criticise, I am looking forward for every critique, especially from expirienced mappers. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I want to thank [pLANE](http://steamcommunity.com/id/plane/ \"link3\") again, who made this map release possible.\r\n\r\nHave fun while hopping,\r\n\r\nkeyuu\r\n\r\n\r\ntrailer by Ntag:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/V_LeEA5S7r0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
