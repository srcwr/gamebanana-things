So far the only know problems is the eyesore the 3d skybox causes, oh and if you manage to look underneath the box, you will see a nodraw error due to application upon a displacement. I never actually COUNTED how many spawns there are, but the entire raised areas are filled with spawns.\r\nRate with your highest 5!\r\n\r\nOh and before this gets trashed for not crediting those hard working authors for their textures here they are.\r\n\r\nCustom Skybox By: Karatek√§fer\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/217\r\n\r\nRed + Blue \"Glass\" by: LODYblokady\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/906\r\n\r\nP.S: NO THAT IS NOT A PENIS"
