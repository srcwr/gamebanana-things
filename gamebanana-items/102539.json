	"_sText": "This map was created over the course of about three hours.  I decided to take a break from making fy_ maps and create something totally new.  On this defuser-explosive map, the field is very open for easy killing, making the rounds very quick and the pace very fast.  Although that is not a typical characteristic of de_ maps, I found this map to be very fun with few players on each team, even though there is room for many players on both sides.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to chizbone for the .nav."
