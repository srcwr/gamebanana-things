Sry for the following screens, but i have to play on dx7 lvl for the rest of the year :-(\r\nIt looks like a big map first, but after only a few rounds played you feel at home everywhere We played it for about 100 rounds by now and its almost even balanced, teamplay is important.\r\nOk enough of spamming, hope you like it. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
