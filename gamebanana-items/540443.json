	"_sText": "This is a map that has been in development for at least like four years. I know not a lot of people play CS:S but this is a map I put a lot of love into on and off over the years. It combines quite a lot of elements of my past CS:S maps I've never released and I am now releasing it for people to check out and host. It is mostly compatible with bomb defusal, but I'm guessing with the use of sourcemod could be used for a bunch of other gamemodes I'm sure.<br><br>You're fighting on the reasonably busy foggy freeway connecting meane street, and green street!<br><br>Let me know what you think - the map encompasses way too much area, but it contains a library, hotel, club, gas station, warehouse, and underneath it all a connecting subway.<br><br>Very compatible with bots, they like to change up the route quite a bit too; so have fun with that!"
