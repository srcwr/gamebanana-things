If a person from your team\r\ntakes it up, he wields it. If a enemy player takes the flag, the flag will be teleported back to the base.\r\n-If the flag is dropped into water, it will also teleport back to the base\r\n-The gun only has 12 bullets, use them wisely\r\n\r\n*Cannons\r\n-Cannons can shoot after each 5seconds\r\n-There is an instruction manual for the cannons on the wall nearby\r\n\r\n*Crowns\r\n-Pick the smokegrenade up above the gate and become the king of your castle\r\n-If you die, crown will be dropped and any player can pick it up\r\n-If you fire the smoke nade, the crown will disappear\r\n\r\n*Teamwork\r\n-Is required for more fun\r\n-Knifing the huge doors alone can be hard and boring, easier with more\r\n-Focus on helping the flag holder!\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nZalos for the ctf prefab, which got tweaked by >>Nemesi$[FR]<<\r\n>>Nemesi$[FR]<<, for being a very good friend and helping me with the map, he has done a lot!!\r\nSmurfii, for his bridge prefab\r\ni3D members and other people that helped testing this map"
