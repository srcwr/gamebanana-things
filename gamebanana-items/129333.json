The only thing that i\r\nwas planning to do was to make a 3d skybox and add more detail\r\nbut as the map is too big i am still thinking about it...\r\n\r\nI recommend that you play the map with\r\nmp_roundtime set to 8 because if someone escape the cts will need a lot of time to find him\r\n\r\nAnd, about the sewers, every cell on the first floor\r\nhave a passage to it but only one is breakable(set randomly\r\nevery round)\r\n\r\nwell, that`s it i hope you like the map, sorry about the bad english and\r\nplease, if you have any suggestions and/or if you find any bugs\r\nplease tell me so i can fix in the final version.\r\n\r\n"
