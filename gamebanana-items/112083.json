	"_sText": "This is a map that I had an idea of quite a while ago. The basic idea is that the terrorists start at the top of the map and the CTs at the bottom. in the tower there are lots of walkways, ramps and ladders that the players can use to reach the top of the tower.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I could have spent longer on this but I just wanted to evaluate the gameplay potential of the idea. In that sense, I think it has turned out well. The map is also good to use with bots, but they can be a bit suicidal from fall damage."
