	"_sText": "I took this map down from gamebanana when i realized that the dear esther decals (blue paint on the walls in screenshots) didnt pack, and they still wont pack. I removed them from the map, and added 3 extra areas of gameplay. This map took a decent amount of time, most of it was put into figuring out the decals. The map has no theme, its just a compilation of whatever i decided to make when i launched hammer."
