It resembles cs_crackhouse but I can ensure you it was made from scratch based off of crackhouse. That is why it has different sized rooms. You'll probably notice some familiar areas and there are new areas for different experiences!!! At the end of the day, I had fun making this and that's all that matters. I hope anyone who finds this has fun with it as well. That is all I have to say. -Brent0nic<br><br>Credit: TasteoBlood for the sick Lost Souls decal!<br>"
