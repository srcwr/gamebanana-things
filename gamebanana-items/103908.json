The only other way is through the ventilation...\r\nThe T's start outside, and have to get in, and to the CT spawn to plant the bomb. They can get there by going down the lift, throuhg the ventilation shafts, or if your feeling lucky, down a large air intake tunnel, complete with deadly spinning fan!\r\n\r\nCheck out some more of my maps on our server!"
