	"_sText": "The aim of the game is to get to the other side without being killed but the T's, If you are a CT you must run for you life picking up weapons and grenades on the way and finally reaching the end and killing the T's. If you are a T the aim of the game is to kill the CT's running down the corridor before they kill you, The thing that evens out the odds is that you have a Machine gun!\r\n\r\nIf you wouldn't mind please leave suggestions in the comment area for corridor_run_v2 :)\r\n\r\nMy Steam name is: TheEvilSandwich\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map!"
