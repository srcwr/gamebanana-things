Without teamwork or someone calling which players to attack/ how to stack the classes then you will struggle.\r\n\r\nThis map was for a allinone collab map that never materialised, out limit was like 8% on everything for the collab map, which is why its pretty basic in terms of looks.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b class=red><font size=\"3\">Map Info</b><br></div></font> \r\n<b class=blue><ul><li>Random team selection. (Random if your attacking or defending)\r\n<li>Choose your own tower when defending.\r\n<li>The attackers get to choose from 3 classes:\r\n<ul><li><b class=red>Fast Class =  | 3150 Health | 1.3x Speed| RED\r\n<li><b class=green>Regular Class = | 4150 Health | 1x Speed  | GREEN \r\n<li><b class=blue>Tank Class = | 7300 Health | 0.8x Speed  | BLUE</b><br></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">This map requires team work and co-operation, when we was beta testing on a 30-40 slot server the map was as balanced as it probably will get. Not too sure what the gameplay is like when there are less than 15 players, maybe not so balanced.
