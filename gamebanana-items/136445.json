	"_sText": "Originally made privately for a scouts server called EKR. Ive decided to release it to the public because it turned out pretty well. I was contemplating releasing this, seeing as its just a retexture/minor additions. But what the hell, Some people might enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis is the gun game version so people can climb up top using the ladders. I've also made the bridge longer so that it leads to t's spawn. Its not much more than the other version but i figured it works better for gun games if they could accually get up top.\r\n\r\nIf you dont want a gun game version, please download the main scoutzknivez_Mario version - Please do not rename this one.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/48420"
