	"_sText": "This is a remake by me of the original cs_deagle5 from 1.6.  The structure of the map has been kept in tact.  Players start with full body armor and a deagle with full ammo.  The map does support 16 players on each side, but that could get chaotic.\r\n\r\ncs_deagle5 is not a complicated map, but usually simple maps lead to more fun."
