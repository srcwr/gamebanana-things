	"_sText": "Custom textured bunnyhop map. Contains 3 custom soundscapes through the levels. Map allows multihop since it is not an easy one. The map is possible on legit, but don't know if possible on capped speed of 400.\r\n\r\nI was given some really constructive feedback on my previous map, and I actually took the note. I learned from some really good mappers, I decided to give it another try. For even my own amazement I managed to pack ALL the textures and content this time. The map content was tested by I am the Walrus. Got help with the custom soundscapes by Tony Montana. Spent alot of time with this map, had alot of fun making it and I hope you will have fun playing it. Music providers are included in the map credits."
