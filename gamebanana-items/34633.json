Knife-Level\r\nWhen a User is on the Knife-Level, it is hard for him to get a kill. So I thought: Wouldn't it be fair if he could ran a bit faster?\r\nCode:\r\n// -- Knife-Level Settings -- //\r\n// If a user is on the Knife-Level, his speed is higher than the \r\n\r\n// Activate the Knife-Level Module? (1=yes, 0=no)\r\ngg_improvement_knife 1\r\n\r\n// Set the speed (default value is a good one, in my opinion)\r\ngg_improvement_knife_speed 1.30\r\n// --- //\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Join-Message\r\nIf a user joins the Server, there will be a message like this:\r\nQuote:\r\nPitBull has joined the Server. Total Wins: 17\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n// -- Join-Message Settings -- //\r\n// If a user joins the server, a message will be sent how much wins he has\r\ngg_improvement_joinmessage 1\r\n// ---//\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Bomb-Messages\r\nThis feature tells the public that the user gained a level for defusing the bomb/planting the exploded bomb.\r\nAlso there is a little cheer for the user who planted the bomb that he should protect the C4.\r\nCode:\r\n// -- Bomb-Message Settings -- //\r\n// Should there be a little cheer for the user when he planted the bomb? (1=yes, 0=no)\r\ngg_improvement_bomb_planted 1\r\n\r\n// Should there be a message that the user leveld-up if the bomb exlpoded? (1=yes, 0=no)\r\ngg_improvement_bomb_exploded 1\r\n\r\n// Should there be a message if a user defuses the bomb? (1=yes, 0=no)\r\ngg_improvement_bomb_defused 1\r\n// --- //\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Wrong-Weapon Notification & set Ammo to a higher value\r\nYou can notify a person if he picked up the wrong weapon. Also you can set the reserve ammo to a value you like.\r\nCode:\r\n// -- Weapon Settings -- //\r\n// Should there be a notification for the player if he picks-up the wrong weapon?\r\ngg_improvement_wwnotify 1\r\n// Should the player get a specific amount of ammo? (0=disabled, every over number is the ammo)\r\ngg_improvement_ammo_more 200\r\n// --- //\r\nInstallation\r\n1. Edit the config\r\n2. Upload to your server\r\n3. Reload gungame (es_reload gungame)"
