	"_sText": "Added a dusk/dawn/storm kind of lighting with a few breaks in the clouds. i have thoroughly tested surf_waffles_2 and there are no more glitches, i added ALOT better textures to the ramps, added more ramps, connecting the 2 sides of the map. there are now words on the teles so now you can tell where youre going, but theres one i put just for laughs that says \"uber pros only\" and when you walk towards it you fall into jail (lol). i have fixed EVERY bug that i got on the first waffles. you can surf the whole map with sv_gravity 800, but all in all i found it optimal to set it at 600-650. theres really not too much floatyness at that point.\r\n\r\ngood map for killing with 6-16 people (banocanyon kind of map, thats the closest map i could think of to this)\r\n\r\nSV_GRAVITY 600-800 (650 optimal)\r\n\r\nedit:the map looks real dark in the screenshots but its fine\r\n\r\ni couldnt include all the screenies, so your gonna have to dl the map to see it all..."
