One request in particular asked to just make it with buyzones.\r\n\r\nSo in the rar are 2 folders. One is called \"WITH BUYZONE\" and one is called \"WITH WEAPONS\".\r\n\r\n\r\n**** IMPORTANT ****\r\n\r\nIn the \"WITH BUYZONE\" folder is the map FY_CHURCHES_X_BZ\r\nThis version of the map has NO WEAPONS (except HE's) on the map. ONLY a buyzone for each team.\r\n\r\nIn the \"WITH WEAPONS\" folder is the map FY_CHURCHES_X_WP\r\nThis version of the map has WEAPONS all over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**** NOTES ****\r\n\r\nI know this map still isn't perfect. It could use displacements and a 3d skybox. I know. And I still don't care to add those.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to make any of my other GUNGAME MAPS into an FY or AIM map, please PM me and tell me. If no one does, then I won't convert those. It only takes about 30 minutes to convert, though. So let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJeremy \"Air\" Hurley"
