I would like to add it is especially pleasing seeing somone been blown of the edge of the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe map is set over 3 height levels and 8 areas although it is not to big. \r\n\r\nThe Nav file is included.\r\n\r\nA good tip for this map is run for cover and move quick and depending on which way the enemy are going try to get on their flank. Have Fun!\r\n"
