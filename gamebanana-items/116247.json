	"_sText": "Hi all,\r\nafter two months of waiting the lhc maps finally arrived, this is the second one out and hopefully some more will follow. my map aims tto rebuild the superconducting magnets, which you can see in this picture: <a href=\" http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j214/Terminatrix75/SuperconductingMagnets2.jpg\"> SuperconductingMagnets2.jpg.</a> Unfortunately i could not built more of the tunnel, because of the limits hammmer editor and source has, however it still look amazing.\r\n\r\nGameplay (this map is for CS:S): \r\nthe pipe is a bit higher than the the players eyes, so the re wont be any spawnkilling. every player spawns with a pumpgun and a grenade, there will also be grenade pickup spots. there are two stratagies: 1. try to kill the other team with grenades or 2. try to jump and kill the other players before they manage to throw their grenades. you ll need to combine these 2 tactics in order to win.\r\n\r\nif you run a funserver and you like this map, i hope that you will put it on rotation as it is fully playable, unique and really a lot of fun. if you don't have an own server, but aswell like the map, then you can still vote for me as the winner of the lhc mapping contests as soon as it has finished(30 November).\r\n\r\nfinal version:\r\n\r\n-improoved colorcorrection\r\n-added env_lightglow\r\n-fixed one fire estinguisher"
