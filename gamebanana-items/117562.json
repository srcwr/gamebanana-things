I do not claim, or have any affiliation with JaGeX Entitled .Consider this, free advertising for http://www.runescape.com/.\r\nThe \"Dm_Rs_Soul_Wars\" map I created is a map I was inspired to make from just playing Runescape. The map is meant to be a vague replica of the mini-game soul wars. Yet since I'm no map making professional as of now, it could use some work in the future but is a well made map with a good size for large team games."
