Running it on a slower machine will result in unsatisfactory framerates in some spots.\r\n\r\nBUGS:\r\n* The snow falls even inside the house.  Just think of it as magic xmas dust!\r\n* Nav mesh still isn't perfect, and bots can still see thru some objects they shouldn't.\r\n\r\nNOTICE:\r\nIt has come to my attention that there is no working .nav file included within the bsp.  Until I fix this problem, you can download the .nav file seperately by <A HREF=\"http://www.binarydemons.com/~strike/files/home4holidaysnav.zip\">clicking here</A>."
