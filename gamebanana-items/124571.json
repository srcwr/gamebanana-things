	"_sText": "An edited and improved version of bhop_blend. Theres not much difference in the gameplay on this version as the old one, so the map plays very closely to the classic version. I thought i could remake it since it had a few areas that were a bit imbalanced. I then took it to further level and edited the whole map because why not.&nbsp;<br><br>Since the gameplay is nearly the same in both version, please remove bhop_blend and add this one to your server instead.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you enjoy! :o)"
