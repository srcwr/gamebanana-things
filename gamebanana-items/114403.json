It was mostly meant for trying out some ideas and learning how to build teleports, lightning, and using Source SDK in general.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way, I broke some textures and alignments using the carve tool. I am aware of this, but it will not be fixed as I would have to remake this entire map. I have learned from my mistakes and am currently working on bigger projects.\r\n\r\n### ---How to play---\r\n\r\nShoot the other team, using weapons found throughout the map and utilizing portal teleportation wisely."
