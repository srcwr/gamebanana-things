	"_sText": "So, this is my first Dev texture map. This is probably my best work, and I probably put the most effort into it. This took a fairly long time, but not that long. It has multiple floors, and they are all unique. I've gotten some good feedback already, and hope you enjoy! It has ambient sounds, lighting, a custom texture, and like, 6 floors. I did something different for each floor, and hope you guys like it.\r\n\r\nThere will be an update soon, in the next 3 days. Maybe even multiple updates. I have played this with a quite of few people, they seem to like it, and the layout is good. I will be changing spawns around, adding some steps to places you should be able to just walk up, and doing some lighting. Hope you guys will like it when its done!"
