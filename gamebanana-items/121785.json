Center - more powerful\r\n  2. Outer - less powerful\r\n- There is a 4 way directional chevron arrow above each pad to launch you in that specific direction.\r\n- There are also chevrons on the walkable water areas that push you towards the bounce pads to launch you back on to the surf.\r\n- If you fall you are spawned in the middle of the map and you have to walk to the bounce pads (the chevron paths are accessible to go faster).\r\n- Each team is color coded:\r\n  Terrorists : RED\r\n  Counter-Terrorists : BLUE\r\n\r\nSkybox - people tell me hipshot.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not ask for constructive criticism cause I honestly don't care, this map is the way I like it. Although, compliments are welcome.\r\n\r\n-- Buck Nasty\r\n\r\nhttp://waspnest.net/\r\nhttp://solidsurf.info/\r\n"
