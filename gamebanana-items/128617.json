	"_sText": "<h2>This version of the map has been fixed and no longer contains the weapon bug, thanks for downloading</h2>\r\n\r\nThis is a <b>multi</b> MG made for 32 player servers (although can fit up to 64 players), that is based inside a scary machine type world. It has 8 Mini-Games which are as follows:\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n1. Long Jump, good ol' long jumpin'\r\n2. Obstacles, from all sides (gets progressively harder)\r\n3. Bunny Hop (which also gets progressively harder the further you get)\r\n4. Mosh Pit, the most insane knife fight you've ever had, especialy on large servers\r\n5. Dark Scout, 0 G scout towers\r\n6. Race, a short but fierce race for weapons\r\n7. King of the Hill, a fight for a capture point with shotguns\r\n8. Fall, the infinite free falling with guns, what could be better\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\nThe map has many AFK features including auto MG selection and it will also give out weapons in certain MGs if it isn't completed in a certain time. It also has custom sounds for each different MG, which makes it very ambient and sometimes quite scary.\r\n\r\nHope you like it,\r\n\r\n<h2>Severn</h2>\r\n\r\nThe download contains the .BSP and also a compressed .BZ2 version."
