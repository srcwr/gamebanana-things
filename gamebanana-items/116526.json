However, hopefully some of you will know of a fix, or at least I can get you interested in the map.  Robots from the show include Hypnodisc, Panic Attack, Nemesis, and, for you retro robot-warers, Roadblock (Season 1, saw on the the front for convenience).\r\n\r\nWhen a robot is destroyed its owner is killed (unless they noclipped out of their box -_-), and a fully functional pit that players can activate by driving into the pit release button (it has a down arrown next to it).\r\n\r\nEnjoy the alpha stage release!\r\n\r\n\r\n[By Starving Hobo]"
