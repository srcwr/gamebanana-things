It's a completely created from scratch and fully hand-tuned .nav-file (because in original mapauthor's release was included simple auto-gen).\r\n<br><br>This Navigation Mesh was hand-maded at 70% because in auto-gen nav some areas were made incorrectly and many paths were blocked (in particular ventilating passes were absolutely impassable).\r\n<br><br>Yeah, bots use all possible ways now. They slip through the map not worse than the office rats! :D\r\n<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/122757\">same map</a>.\r\n<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also don't lazy to leave your responses ;-)\r\n<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nHakk1tus (for this dashingly twisted and variously designed office-themed map, also for his other nice maps).\r\n<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n<br><br>P.S. Thanks <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/1332134\">O.T.I.S.</a> for NAV-testing and detailed comparative report!\r\n<br><br>Welcome to Bloodbath in Paradise! :-)"
