	"_sText": "Map Prefabs provided by:\r\nfallqvist\r\nUberkirsche\r\nhalf life storm\r\n\r\nI thought of the idea of making just a simple castle to use for fun, but when I was done, it was very empty, boring and very plain. So i got a few prefabs and lightened up the map a bit. Overall this map works a lot better than I though it would. When i was making it I thought it would be too big and have too many open areas, but after the compile and making of the .nav file, it worked really well. There's just enough open space to be able to run around in but also enough structure (such as rocks, trees and boxes) to hide around. \r\n\r\nThis map is really  more for a DM server but I put the bomb zone in there so the map would restart after a certain amount of time if the bomb hasn't been planted to make it easier on most dm servers to play. \r\n\r\nThe spawns of the both teams are somewhat scattered around the map to make playing in the map a bit more intense.\r\n\r\nThe map does have buy zones and an easter egg. To get the easter egg, you must jump from the highest point of the castle straight down and you will be teleported to the top of a rock where you can easilly snipe from. I also included buy zones in the map for regular gameplay."
