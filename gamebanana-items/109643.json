	"_sText": "It took me about a day to make this, and unashamedly you can tell!\r\n\r\nShotguns are great weapons. auto shotguns are even better. I enjoy making small maps like this for CQB and quick killings, as you know you don't have to hang about for a while until the roudn ends. I've put moderate effort into this, i haven't gone over the top simply because if i filled the place with props then CSS couldn't handle it: also the simplicity is perfect, as to be honest you're not going to be staring at aesthetics whilst pumping some shells into someone else.\r\n\r\nthe focal point of the map is the centre ramps. it's hit and miss, do you brave the gunfire and try to get a distinct advantage of higher ground, or do you chicken out and stay on the ground? later on in the round when there are less people to worry about, heading up there could certainly raise your score a bit.\r\n\r\nso yes. it's an aim map for the little-used (yet wholly underrated) XM1014. I recommend no more than 32 players in total, any more and the lag starts to affect gameplay. max is 46 players, have tested it on a full server and it's certainly became a hit.\r\n\r\nenjoy!"
