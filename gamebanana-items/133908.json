Beta 2 was released on the NyOm nYom server, and is basically a sexied up beta 1 with \"NyOm nYom\" in the sky - but if anyone would like it, please ask and I will upload.\r\n\r\nThank's to Logan Dougall for his Cell shader tutorial http://www.fpsbanana.com/tuts/2408 and cheers to NyOm nYom for their support and for hosting my maps. Not to mention my good CS:S mate Wild Turkey. \r\n\r\nThere are many more maps of similar style on their way, I've been busy :)\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy, any tips comments or feedback would be great.\r\n\r\n-tankie"
