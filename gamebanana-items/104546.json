This small and simple layout creates frantic fire-\r\nfights within the dark tunnels and the outside of the hotel.\r\n\r\nThis level may cause quite a bit of lag and/or stress on the \r\nvideo card. It is recommended you lower your settings in \r\nintense multi-play. This map has bot support yet they do not \r\nuse all the paths well and are predictable. They may also get \r\nstuck at the windows of the hotel.\r\n\r\nThis map also contains custom soundscapes which will make you feel like you are really there. \r\n\r\nMost of all, have fun.\r\n\r\nDarkMortar."
