This map is quite big and has a lot of room to run around and sneak around. \r\n\r\nThere are some really cool \"Easter Eggs\" or so called 'hints' you can find. And one of the hints will lead you into a Disco Room! \r\n\r\nRemember, this is just a Beta! I wanted to make sure this map gets some words  in from other people so I could make it better!\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nBoogerJay (Bjay)"
