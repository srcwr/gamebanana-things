	"_sText": "This is a simple Random Teleporting prefab.\r\n\r\nWorks for CS:S and HL2:DM\r\n\r\nOnce you go through the teleport trigger, there will be 3 different possible exit points, if one is blocked (by a player, npc, or prop), a red light appears above it, and will port you to another one randomly.\r\n\r\nI added a few barrels so players can test blocking certain teleports, if they wanted to test this prefab alone.\r\n\r\nAlso very good if you have 3 players jump into a teleport at the exact same time, and don't want them all to get stuck in 1 destination.\r\n\r\nThis is an old old prefab, but i figured i might as well upload it since i havent uploaded anything in awhile.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT*** I forgot, the screenshot posted does not show CT and T spawn points, i added them after the shot.\r\n\r\nPlus this includes a bsp as well as vmf. so u may test for either HL2DM or CSS ;)"
