It's not anything special, by far, rather than a quickie challenge me and a friend made with each other to see who could make a better crap surf map.\r\n\r\nApparently he liked mine, thus, the map is being put out in public just for the hell of it. It's not that it's too short or too simple, it's that it's actually pretty fun.\r\n\r\nI'll sum everything up by asking you to check out the screenshots and check it out for yourself. This map has various traps to make it worth wanting to stay alive, though none of them are so hazardous that you continuously fail to survive.\r\n\r\nSo, Bananites, What do you think?"
