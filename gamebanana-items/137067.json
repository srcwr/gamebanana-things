	"_sText": "This is my first map, but not my last. This map took me quite a while for me to make. It is bigger then I first expected, but I think that it still works. I decided to go with a gungame map as my first map since I love playing gungames so much. I used a tile texture from Hamster's tile pack as the main floor, and I used the 101 Source Mapping tut to help get started and figure out how to work hammer. I would like constructive criticism on this map that will help me make better ones. I also plan on releasing a smaller version of this map in the near future. I hope everyone enjoys. Btw, Hamster has credit since I used his tile pack."
