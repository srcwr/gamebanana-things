It's nowhere near perfect but I think that it can be good fun especially for players that are capable of keeping their speed throughout the whole map.<br>Run Time between 1 - 2 minutes. Possible on Scroll and MaxVel, probably annoying on MaxVel though.<br><br>This is my first bhop map and feedback is greatly appreciated.<br>In the future I might create some more detailed maps too.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Netcode"
