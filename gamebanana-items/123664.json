Its size is absolutely epic, just scraping the surface of the impossible limit of hammer editor's grid.  Each screen shot is literally looking at around 1/20th of the entire map. This tower is designed to appeal to the general audience of Counter-Strike: Source, as it is easy to the point of basic skill, yet gets harder as you ascend.  It's fun and requires teamwork, precise jumping techniques, and creative thinking.  I currently need beta testers and would love to have you try it out.  \r\n\r\nPlease assess and provide constructive feedback.  </h3>"
