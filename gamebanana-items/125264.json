(anyway i hope i made it nice, though)\r\nI also made almost all textures, so dont flame me that i didnt take credit to someone... :-!\r\n\r\n<b>What the map contain?</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New custom textures !\r\n<li>15 basic levels, which are made for beginners as well as for good bhopers.\r\n<li>No scout at beginning, only if you finish the map, you can choose your scout.\r\n<li>Bunnyhop platforms speed is 10 units per second - optimal for non-MPbhop servers or singleplayer.\r\n<li>Listen to relax music at spawn :D\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is final version! I'm not going to improve anything on this map!\r\n<h3><b>Good Luck & Have Fun</b></h3>"
