The NPC characters have been removed to improve on frame rates\r\nas well as fix nav mesh issues.\r\n2. Clipped some rocks in one stairwell to avoid players from\r\ngetting stuck.\r\n3. Added some new lighting to the map mainly in two dark areas that\r\nwould have been camper's paradise.\r\n4. Added nav file for bot play\r\n5. Added working soundscape\r\n6. All files are embedded and fully working.\""
