The whole map is made out of displacements, and it has HDR.\r\n\r\nI am happy to hear any Complaints or Suggestions, and of course, positive feedback. \r\n\r\nDo not decompile or edit in any way without my permission. I may be making a few versions of this map, so stay tuned. \r\n\r\nIf you want to put it on your server please tell me! Because I'll stop by and play!\r\n\r\nThe maximum players are 25 on 25, but I prefer a smaller game of 10 on 10. But please be free to try more. \r\n\r\nHave fun, and play hard!\r\n\r\nCurrently running on this server IP: 85.234.148.18:29025\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nIF YOU DOWNLOADED THIS MAP PREVIOUS TO TUESDAY, APRIL 24TH, THEN DELETE THE 2 EXTRA FILES (THE ZTMP FILES) THAT CAME WITH THE MAP! THEY CREATE PROBLEMS WHEN PEOPLE DOWNLOAD THE MAP OFF OF A SERVER."
