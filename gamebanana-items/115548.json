Now if there are some server side entitys added they surpass 2048 and crash the game\r\n\r\nI moved it to Other/misc section because its clearly not a minigame\r\nIf this map is stable without bugs i will make more bomberman maps\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to play\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAim is to kill the enemy team\r\nWith E you throw bombs\r\nWhen looking on the ground while pressing E\r\nyou lay a bomb\r\nYou can kick a layed bomb by running towards the bomb\r\nThere are boxes that can be broken to aquire amazing power ups\r\n\r\nPower ups\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Extrabomb.......you can lay 1 more bomb at same time\r\n- Firepower.......Aoe radius increases\r\n- Health..........You get 25 hp\r\n- Superhealth.....Full heal and HP cap to 150\r\n- Speed...........you run faster\r\n\r\n### Bomb Types\r\n\r\n- Icebomb..........Slows\r\n- Firebomb.........Molotov Coctail\r\n- Electrobomb......Stuns\r\n- Windbomb.........Throws you in the air  **REMOVED**\r\n\r\nAfter 3 minutes of gametime sudden death starts\r\nwhich cause the lava to rise\r\n\r\n- 16 CT Spawns\r\n- 16 T Spawns\r\n\r\nCurrent Bugs Statement\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n##### Players unable to lay a bomb\r\nFIXED!!!!\r\n\r\nPost comment"
