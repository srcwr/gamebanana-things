	"_sText": "This is the latest and greatest of my FR (FootRace) map's. The setting is a Greek temple in the sky, the home of the wind god. You have been summoned to fight to become his successor. You must race against others to the wind god's throne on the top of the temple. Once you reach the throne you will be given the god's divine powers and they will blow everyone else off the temple and back to Earth. On the way to the throne you will face many trials, traps, and illusions. If you have any trouble and get stuck on the map remember the illusion part of what I said. This map is truly different than anything you have ever played and I'm sure you will have fun racing against to become the next wind god. Please assess and enjoy this map. \r\n\r\n\r\nA special thanks to Drunkguitarist for many trap ideas and the idea for the theme. Also thanks to his girlfriend for correcting us and letting us know this is more Greek than Roman :D. "
