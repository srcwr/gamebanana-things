	"_sText": "Hi All,\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I recently discovered that my last submission of the final version of de_dust2_pro actually contained the wrong bsp file (instead of the final version it contained the same version as the beta release)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I have no idea how this mix up happened, or how long it has been like that. I'm not sure if anyone got the final version, or whether some people did and it got changed later.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The beta version had some serious design mistakes that imo really spoiled the map. I decided the best thing to do would be to resubmit the map to give people the chance to get the correct file. For those who already have the correct final version then no harm done, and for those who got the beta version by mistake, here is a chance to see the real map.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enjoy!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC0220JGmiM&amp;t=157s"
