	"_sText": "<b>DE_LEIKA</b> by Cleiton Palandrani (released May 2012)\r\n<br><br>Well, I worked on this map for three months... My idea was to make a map, with pleasant weather, with good lighting and easy gameplay.<br><br>I used custom sounds in some places, (wind chimes, classical music) you can check in CT spawn, bombsite A, long hall and other places... Were used custom sprites (flowers on the displacement) to make the environment more beautiful... \r\n<br><br>The map was well optimized, provides high fps and smooth gameplay.\r\n<br><br>- Can I play versus Bots?<br>- Yes! nav. built manually with place names for better gameplay!\r\n<br><br>Map details: 40 spawn points (20 vs 20), soundscapes, 3D skybox, radar overview, custom textures and models, custom sprites (vbsp), custom sounds.\r\n<br><br>Map design: Cleiton Palandrani\r\n<br><br>Important: All the custom content (except the nav) are embedded in the bsp.\r\n<br><br>Contributors/Credits: Thomas 'Hessi' Hess (<a href=\"http://www.thomashess.net\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">www.thomashess.net</a>) - some textures and models; Soenke 'Warby' Seidel (<a href=\"http://www.warby.de\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">www.warby.de</a>) - some textures and prop window; d00ds (<a href=\"http://d00ds.com\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">http://d00ds.com</a>) - light model, fish model.\r\n<br><br>Thanks: Thomas 'Hessi' Hess for allowing me to use their content."
