[>>Masogs blog<<](http://masog.wordpress.com \"\")\r\n\r\nv1:\r\n- Added one missing texture..\r\n- I can't fix textures bug... If someone know how to fix it, I will be happy.\r\n- I think that bug with spawn is fixed.\r\n- Added 4 hegrenades at the top.\r\n- Deleted music.\r\n\r\nThis is Knife Arena map, created for the Battle of Details contest (not from GameBanana). The theme of the contest is Science Fiction. This is a really big Knife Arena map. On my map here are some ropes and you can climb on them. Here are two \"flying cars\" and they are controlled by auto-pilot. \r\n\r\nI did this map in 4 days.\r\n\r\nThis is perfect map for minigames server. Yea, I know, this is KA map, not MG - but here are a lot of fun! \r\n\r\n- TT spawns: 24.\r\n- CT spawns: 24.\r\n- \"Flying Cars\": 2.\r\n- Ropes: about 100.\r\n- Textures: Portal by reacz.\r\n- Music: no"
