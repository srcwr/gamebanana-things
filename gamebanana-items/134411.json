	"_sText": "Well, here is my second attempt at a gg_deagle map. It was made as a request from some friends of mine in the -FS- Clan. Basically, the map is an island that has the gg_deagle layout and the boxes are breakable, as well as the boards connecting on the bridge. Surrounding the island, is water of course, but is also a killbox to wipe out any of you swimmers out there. Thats basically it... the map is mad fun when theres a bunch of people in the server, and even more so when you have m249's. \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nDark Demon (Madshot)  -  Came up with the idea and put it on the FS server (208.100.5.133:27015) to test it out. It was a smashing success.\r\n\r\nRedrum  -  Helping me with my first map to show the clan I could map =D\r\n\r\nAlso... if you would like to add the map to your server... please PM me first. I would really rather you head to the server to try it out instead. \r\n\r\nThats about it... happy fraggin!"
