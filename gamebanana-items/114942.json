	"_sText": "This is a remake of COD's wetwork I started like five years ago. The initial project can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://gamebanana.com/projects/34453\r\n\r\nTechnically, this is the remake of the remake since it is an adaptation of what the original remake was. This one features way better performance, more and better detail, lots of fixes of all kinds and a different theme which serves as an fps saver compared to the previous one.\r\n\r\nThe hull and the superstructure of the ship are made completely out of world brushes, so be grateful. It took many hours to build this.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nLDR only lighting, tweaked and optimized nav file with place names, overview image, a few custom content, soundscapes, 64 player spawns, original COD's layout.\r\n\r\nRecommended players: up to 28\r\nMax recommended bots: up to 10\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case you want to review the project page of this version, here it is:\r\nhttp://gamebanana.com/projects/34800  \r\n\r\nHave fun!"
