	"_sText": "Hi\r\n\r\nWelcome to Surf Forbidden Tomb\r\n\r\nThis is a new and exciting skill surf map designed and made by Spliff and myself.\r\n\r\nIt contains 8 levels and 2 \"jails\".\r\n\r\nAlong the way, try to find the 8 secret buttons that will unlock the secret tomb of Anubis. Can you find them?\r\n\r\nThanks to Target Practice for the use of his Fallback system. Every fail will result in 5 hp being removed from you health. To gain 100 health once more, simply push the button at the start each level.\r\n\r\nThe map has also been designed with Surf Infamous' unique hide and seek game. Simply hide yourselves throughout the levels as the person who finishes the map tries to find you :D\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it\r\n\r\nSpliff\r\nRiddler\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-5fROlEEr58&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-5fROlEEr58&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"260\" height=\"216\"></embed></object>\r\n"
