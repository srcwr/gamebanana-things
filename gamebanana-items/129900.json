	"_sText": "**FIXED THE DIVING BOARDS, AND GLITCHY WALLS IN POOL, ALSO REDUCED ARMORY WINDOW SIZE**\r\n\r\nThe third official installment of the night_out jailbreak series. I will keep updating these, but at some point they will stop coming as consistently as they are now, since this whole thing is... 'new'.\r\n\r\n**TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT DIFFERENT TEXTURES:**\r\n_I know that the pool texture is weird. The walls may have somewhat of an odd colour, but they can be changed. I know that some of you won't think this map is astonishing, so if you're going to leave feedback or hateful comments, at least let me know why, so I can try and develop a good map for the community. Let me know what you want to see stay the same, change, or have suggestions for._\r\n\r\nAlso, in some parts of the map I should add, like under the new armory window, there is a big space. **I also need suggestions for what to fill these spaces with.** I will credit you in some way, for example, put you as a supporter/idea-giver in the Authors and Assistants section.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** For those of you looking for ba_night_out_v2, it was trashed with only two downloads. There were a lot of things that needed fixing, so I decided to take them on before releasing v3."
