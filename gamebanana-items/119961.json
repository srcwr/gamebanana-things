Just a simple map. 2 Forts, a big open space in the middle, a river, landmines, etc.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n-Landmines in random places of the river\r\n-3 story forts. Bottom, Middle, Roof (both forts the same for each team)\r\n-wall outlining the yard that you can travel on\r\n-breakable steel bar windows\r\n-door frames with prop_door_rotating entities!\r\n-rain\r\n-3d hill skybox\r\n\r\n...ENJOY!"
