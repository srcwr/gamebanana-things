	"_sText": "2_5a: I made some small time changes for spawning brushes and dynamics, so now the map should not crash with +60 players on any mode. I also added some small secret area.\r\n\r\nThe map is kind of themed about boat escape and includes 7 modes, 5 CT sided weapons, 5 T sided weapons.\r\n\r\nThis is the first version i decided to release and hopefully its free of my bug stupidity. \r\nSorry for that there is no lightning currently but i have a kind of bigger mess with that and i would prefer to change that in the same time period of changing/ adding more stuff to the map deppending on the critic. \r\n\r\nAlso thanks to sgt.zacade and noctali for teaching me things."
