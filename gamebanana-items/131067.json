	"_sText": "ZE_TRAINESCAPE_B2\r\n\r\nOriginally Created and Developed By:\r\nArchanor & DaReDeViL\r\n(zombie_trainescape_b2)\r\n\r\nNumber of Spawn Points: 64\r\nRecommended Player Count: 24-32\r\n\r\nSo I've heard great things about zombie_trainescape from my Zombie Horde-fanatic friends, and figured it was time to introduce a proper ZombieMod version. All credit for the map goes to Archanor & DaReDeViL. All I've done have reworked the spawn points, starting area, and starting weapons to better fit ZM. \r\n\r\nThe terrorists now spawn outside the pods, there's no more \"killer gas\", and you start with a knife and p228 to get you started until you can reach the weapons area. Gameplay has been tested, and besides these changes, everything is authentic. Please thank the creators for such a good map and keep in mind that any comments and/or assessments should be for the map itself, and not my changes. This is their map, after all.\r\n\r\nRemember, to get the train started, you've got to start all 4 generators.\r\nHope to see this map on some ZM servers soon enough.\r\nThanks and enjoy! =D\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nÂ£cho\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative"
