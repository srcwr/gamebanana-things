	"_sText": "EDIT: I apologize for releasing xdream5 in its state it was in we did not test it like we should have and there were bugs that needed to be fixed. so im releasing this fix the fix includes fixing the sky box lighting which made the map shiny map is no longer shiny i also changed the water texture to a duller more recognizable texture which is not shiny either easier on the eyes. i fixed jail where it kills you when u enter sometimes not all the time did it but that should be fixed now. i fixed the right side sky water which killed you when you land on it i also added some more detail to the map which makes it more interesting. we tested this map properly this time there should not be any more bugs what so ever in this fix. Again i do apologize for the inconvenience im also releasing a fix for evo as well.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my version of x dream yes there is alot but none that is committed for tricks with this version has alot more of a potential for tricks. i have to many upgrades and improvements to list here you will need to test it out for yourself to get the full feel of this map. no idc about anyone's negative feedback so keep that to yourself if you dont like this you probably suck ass at xdream. well here ya go have fun oh there is a secret in the map i installed have fun looking for it :D"
