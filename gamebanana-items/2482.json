	"_sText": "This pack was inspired by Just Cause 2, it is my second ever prefab release!  This pack is basically intended to help add detail to your maps, it focuses on a middle eastern setting and provides a variety of different prefabs for your use!  Feel free to modify my prefabs to the needs of your map, I made them so they are intentionally easy to modify for your own needs! The map displayed in the screenshots is a showcase map intended to demonstrate the prefabs (not all of them are in the map).\r\n\r\nNote I: Please Credit me on release of your map if you use one of my prefabs, (Terrora).\r\n\r\nNote II: Some of the buildings are variations of each other, this isn't a cheap way to add more content easily its the same with any game they re-use their assets wherever possible!\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n- 7 Unique Detailed Big Buildings\r\n- 2 Petrol Stations\r\n- 2 Smaller Houses\r\n- 1 Garage\r\n- 3 Types of Fencing\r\n- 1 Telephone Box\r\n- 3 Billboards\r\n- 4 Concrete Barriers\r\n- 2 Wooden Barriers\r\n\r\nThanks Alex (Terrora / Roluffy)"
