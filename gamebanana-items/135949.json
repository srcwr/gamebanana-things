	"_sText": "So I made this map in 20 minutes and people on my server loved it.\r\nI wasn't going to release it but people said a should.\r\n\r\nI made this map in tribute to my server (NS Gungame) NS as a whole is a bunch of different servers but my server is in the spotlight lately. I named it Noskill because that's the name of the clan.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the map is really... Carnage! 64 spawn points but designed for a 14 man server.\r\n\r\nIt looks very basic but I spent time making as many entrances and ways to go as possible.\r\nHopefully the map won't be discredited for just plain being 'too small'.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo enjoy.\r\n\r\nPS: Works nice on DM :)"
