Aliens are the way I’m going right now…\r\n\r\nBot can get lost and the last two players can evade each other to a point! And you honestly don’t know what the other team is going to do there are so many options. Snipers have the best advantage!\r\n\r\nAny way any ideas?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'm moving this to BETA, since I got feed back from outside this community and I've also updated the bsp file, The NAV file was incorrect and I didn't want the server tied up for three hours recompiling it!!! so I fixed the NAV file that pakrat said it was going to fix and it all works! this map is live and in a three map rotation on my server. the only make not yet uploaded here is also one of the three, I just haven't decided if I want to release two versions of the map one AIM (suggested by a friend) and the other DE, if you could see the DE version!?!? ;)\r\n\r\nhere is a link to my server...\r\nhttp://sincitysource.graytap.com/"
