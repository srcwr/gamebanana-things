	"_sText": "This map was my second major project into mapping. My first is not finished and probably never will. \r\nThis map consists of 6 main areas, the 4 warehouses, the house/office, and the crane.\r\nEach area consists of camping and barricading spots suited to anyone's taste to zombie survival, as well as high spots as people like to climb away form the sprawl of zombies coming towards them. \r\nThis map does not have any secrets as it annoys me to see people use them, i believe everyone should have a fair advantage in a zombie game.\r\n\r\nHave fun with this map as much as i enjoyed making it, although some places i wish i could kill over and over again.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to use modify this map, please ask for vmf.\r\n\r\nCredits to Mushroom for the basic base of the trucks.\r\n(http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/777)"
