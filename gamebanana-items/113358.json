Every player spawns with a scout, deagle, knife, and a nade.  Also, there is buyzones in the very middle of the map.  This map has a secret hidden button that changes the gravity for 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Very_Angry_Beaver the creator of AB_space skybox textures, and SintaxError for finding it for me long after the site that hosted it went down.  Also thanks to everyone at the Williams Street, for making some of the best cartoons ever.\r\n\r\nCustom moon textures made by me kaos4u.\r\n"
