	"_sText": "This map evolved from one of my older projects. Initially it was a \r\nhostage rescue map. But I decided to keep things simpler. Uses assets \r\nfrom BM Source mod and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (SDK version). The school building\r\n itself, materials on buildings, asphalt textures as well as a bunch of \r\noriginal graffiti decals are mine. I used the real world photographs I \r\nmade of a real school in the city of Donetsk. Skybox and env settings \r\nwere borrowed from cs_havana. 3D skybox is based on standard HL2 assets,\r\n so it does not reflect the real location layout."
