I added rocks there so its a bumpy and more realstic underground base. There are other rooms that serv no meaning. But don't think i forget to make good camping spots.\r\nE.G there is only one Door going to the hanger that can easly be blocked by a vending machine, but there is a teleport going there, Wtich can't be blocked becasue its in mid air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, As of 8pm CET. This map. and its messed Textures has been updated\r\n\r\nThanks to Gangstakill for helping me fix my map, *not compiling*\r\n\r\n9PM(9\\10\\2008 DD\\MM\\YY) CET. IT TURNED OUT THAT I PUT THE WRONGE MAP FILE UP. SO IF You want this on a server, you will need to redownload it\r\n"
