	"_sText": "This was in the Maps in Progress Section, but after going over it, I think the only thing I might change in the future would be the textures.\r\n\r\nThis is not a final release, but as close to the final as I think I might get with this one.\r\n\r\nThis map (gg_trench) features two small towers across from a large double trench with a bridge over it. There are tunnels connecting the towers through the trenches and another approach from underground. My map has many different height/distance approaches for those who favor sniping, camping, rushing, and dying. \r\n\r\nIf you can think of any improvements to the overall look or the gameplay, let me know. \r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<b><c>**UPDATE**</b></c>\r\n\r\nOkay, I could <i>only</i> make 24 player spawns. Per team. If you can find a way to run/host a 48 man game, feel free to use this map."
