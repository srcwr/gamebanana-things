	"_sText": "**About** - This is my first map. Made it like 3 years ago. Doesn't mean it's bad. This is my most played dodgeball map. Hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n**Bugs** - When you turn your flashlight on it cuts the map in half and shows you the skybox. I have no idea what thats all about.\r\n\r\n**Requirements** - Server running a dodgeball script. Map will not work without one.\r\n\r\n**Cool Features** - After 30 seconds or so the map pushes everyone out of spawn to stop AFKers and whatnot. \r\n\r\n**Future Version Plans** - I'm planning on creating a bunch of maps using this as a template. Having different textures and scenes in the background.\r\n\r\n**Installation** - Extract map file to Steam\\steamapps\\USERNAME\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n**P.S.** - Make sure to visit [AoDCommunity.com](http://AoDCommunity.com \"AoDCommunity.com\")"
