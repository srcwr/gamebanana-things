It was the playground designed for adults who likes to have a firefight. The map was colored like toy playground but acts like tournament arena so people can try their skill on the playground.\r\n\r\nIt was simple teamdeathmatch playground. You do not need to put/defuse any bombs or save any hostages. Just neutralize all enemy team and your team will win.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map. =D\r\n\r\nVersion - 0.8 - Feburary 15, 2009\r\n\r\nZIP CONTENTS\r\n-------------------\r\nOne .BSP file - the map file\r\nEleven pictures of the map\r\nOne readme text notepad\r\n\r\nHOW TO INSTALL\r\n--------------------\r\nThe Installation is simple.
