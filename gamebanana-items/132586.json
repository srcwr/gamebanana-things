	"_sText": "After 5 years wasting my life with WoW, I'm back for Mapping and ZombieMod. My latest map was zm_Fidlers-Green and this is something like my warmup-map. \r\n\r\nThe map is taking place in a little castle with 4 courtyards, which are connected with each other through the towers(Screenshot 5). The mapstyle is very simple and a mix of de_piranesi and zm_cbble. Even with the big filesize the map is relative small and easy to overview. The 64 spawnpoints are splitted across the whole map to avoid lagging start and blocking. Every yard has 5+ camping places, most of them are crates. The yard with the rocks and lake could be lagging with many players, the rest should be okay even with 64.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to find a 40+ player Zombie Mod Server to test this baby in action, so please add Euerfeldi in Steam and tell me, when you add it to your mapcycle :)\r\nAlso if you find bugs/exploits, report them to me and I can delete them in the final version.\r\n\r\nsry for bad english and goodnight\r\n      Euerfeldi aka lÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¶l^^"
