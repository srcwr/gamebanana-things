	"_sText": "Hey guys! It's the second version of the glasstowers map... And what I did? Actually pretty much a lot because the previous map was 3,25MB and this one is 5MB... anyways I played on the first version in a couple of servers and I wasn't so excited because people were abusing spawn shots (u could see another spawn far away from your spawn) anyways so what I did is:\r\n\r\n- Anti-spawn shots \r\n- Moved spawns\r\n- Added two more little towers\r\n- Added HDR\r\n- Changed some little things (added nades on top of towers etc.)\r\n- Improved Gameplay\r\n- Gave some more screenshots (like someone wated before)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nDarven\r\n\r\n*EDIT* All the little holes in the map has been fixed and the file has been uploaded so for all of you who wants to use in on a server just re download it"
