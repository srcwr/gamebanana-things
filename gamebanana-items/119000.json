	"_sText": "This is my first map I've ever released for CS:S, it's intended to be an awp map. The idea was to make this map immense to allow for very large teams. \r\n\r\nAt each spawn and scattered around the map are several Awps, Deagles and HE grenades. There are no buyzones.\r\n\r\nThe map consists of 4 very large towers at each corner of the map, a series of bunkers on glass platforms in the center, a maze of bridges, ladders and walkways, and a large gray wall in between to serve as defense for potential spawn snipers.\r\n\r\nAnyways, that's about it, I hope you enjoy it. I've screened this map through a few friends for beta testing, with some changes they seem to enjoy it, let me know what you think!\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look at my map, and have fun. "
