	"_sText": "MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THIS(!) VERSION OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of bugs this will hopefully be the last update.\r\nFixed and added:\r\n\r\n1. Customized, the fps is much higher now. This wasn't done by Makaroonivelli because he had to do other maps. It was done by me. I don't really have a big knowledge of customizing so the fps only changed 10 or 20 frames higher.\r\n\r\n2. The leaks are gone. You can't escape from the map anymore.\r\n\r\n3. Texture changes. Some textures are changed.\r\n\r\n4. Doors are added and made slower to make it harder for the people to survive.\r\n\r\n5. push at spawn is faster so there will be less people be stuck in each other.\r\n\r\n6. Longer waiting time untill the doors open.\r\n\r\n7. Zombies without knives bug is gone.\r\n\r\n8. I made a little story at the beginning to introduce you the map, and made another sky camera so you will have two points of view when you join the game.\r\n\r\n9. trigger_pushes at the teleports so camping is not impossible.\r\n\r\n10. And some other little things.\r\n\r\nThe map didn't change a lot. But some things are better now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for playing!"
