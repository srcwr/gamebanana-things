This map, originally intended as a map to be included with the initial release of VIP Mod, has been sitting on 3D-Mikes hard drive waiting to be finished for over a year.\r\n\r\n3D-Mike finally passed the \"map in progress\" to VIP Mod creator L. Duke for the final touches and to be compiled. L. Duke has tested, compiled, retested etc. until it was ready for you now. \""
