	"_sText": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThis map has been on i3D's Deathrun server for some time now (84.244.187.239:27015), and it's been a big hit. So I'm uploading it on FPSbanana for all the other servers. It's best played on servers with 32+ slots, but a max of 64.\r\n\r\nIt's quite a random map, no theme intended, just fun!\r\n\r\nv1 updates:\r\n\r\n- Fixed major lag issue,\r\n- Fixed sound bugs,\r\n- CT's can now run faster with their weapons,\r\n- Trap times reduced,\r\n- a few other little things.\r\n\r\nHope you all like it, have fun.\r\nKrypt (A.k.a KeV)"
