	"_sText": "A simple remake of the famous map \"3mc\\_training\".\r\n\r\n\r\nADDED:\r\n\r\n- More detail and realism;\r\n- New spots and rooms;\r\n- Sun environment;\r\n- New Skybox;\r\n- 3D Skybox;\r\n- Dynamic lights with physics (ragdoll if you shoot or touch them) in the indoors;\r\n- Player clips to fix some bad/unfair camping spots, and now the palms are real! You can't pass through them;\r\n- More tactics available for Terrorists adding a scalable rope on the right of the T spawn to reach immediately the second floor;\r\n- More tactics available for Counter-Terrorists adding an indoor stairway on the left of the CT spawn to reach the second floor paying less attention to the Terrorists shots;\r\n- Forced lightmap at 3 on the outdoor floor to make the shadows looks much better;\r\n- Lighting atmosphere is now realistic.\r\n\r\nYou may have some FPS decrease by 30/40 because of the modify, if you want to play with good FPS (if you have a bad computer), try to turn the shadows \"Min.\" in the advanced video options.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\n\r\nPut the \"3mc\\_training\\_detailed.bsp\" file into your \"counter-strike source/cstrike/maps\" directory, and then run the game by clicking \"Create Server\" and selecting \"3mc\\_training\\_detailed\"."
