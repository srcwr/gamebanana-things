	"_sText": "ORIGINAL TEXT:<br><br>This is my new map. So much people like mgraceparking and want a new \r\nrace map.\r\n\r\nThis new race is more big than mgraceparking.\r\n\r\nPlayer can't fight during the first race, if you hit a obstacle, you \r\nwill be teleported in the jail with weapon (cut/gun/pm/rifle/...).\r\n\r\nThis new version is call \"extended\" because the race is slighty longer \r\nthan the first version.\r\nThe jail has been improve and final jail-room get a button for restart \r\nthe race. One more music was added (Just Jack - Basement) and there is \r\nthe opportunity to play a round without music.\r\n\r\nHere is the list of the music :\r\n\r\n- Poperotik - B*tch plz\r\n- M83 - Midnight city\r\n- PSY - Gangnam Style\r\n- Just Jack - Basement\r\n\r\nThanks to Crazy Gaming team.\r\n\r\nNote :\r\n\r\nThe .rar contains the map and the .bak. is not necessary for play.<br><br>NOTE:<br>In this version of the map, the exploit still exists where you can get out of the map. Some old CS:GO mg servers kept it because it was fun. If you want the fixed version of the map without the exploit, <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/590044\" class=\"SelectedElement\">go here</a>.<br><br>Ported from <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/80248\" target=\"_blank\">CS:GO</a> with <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004460078\" target=\"_blank\">permission granted</a>."
