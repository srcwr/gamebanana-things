As compared to version 1 i've added a few more routes, cubemaps, fixed some bugs, and a few other things.\r\n\r\nThis is a pure surf map with no weapons at start. Surf down the course (its long and fast) to the end (if you make it :P ) and then pick up a gun and shoot the other team. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nsnoop (at-) aanet.com.au"
