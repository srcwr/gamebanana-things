	"_sText": "Update:\r\n-------\r\nde_rush_v2 improves the following aspects of the map de_rush for league play.\r\n\r\nsize of bomb spots increased (gameplay)\r\nbomb spots marked (user friendly)\r\nsea gull lost its wings (exploit)\r\ngrass sprites in mid removed (fps)\r\n2 trees in mid replaced with fern (fps and boost)\r\n2 benches in mid replaced with flower bed (movement)\r\nremaining bench in mid provides better cover (gameplay)\r\nboost spot near mid stairs clipped (exploit)\r\nrailing clip near A fixed (bug)\r\nrock near A new clip (movement)\r\norrery at A new clip (movement)\r\ndoors in mid new clip to prevent bomb drop (bug)\r\nbalcony near cave new clip (boost)\r\ncave got a roof (cosmetic)\r\nroute above underpass better lit (gameplay)\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n------\r\nThis is the upgraded final version of de_rush, the 4th map of d00ds.com following de_losttemple, de_cpl_fire and de_nightfever.\r\nde_rush takes place on a small island, where you easily could spend your next holidays. Back from nightfever you'll find yourself in a warm and sunny environment, just in time to fight back a terrorist attempt to ruin your vacation day. So don't forget your sunglasses ...\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n------\r\n\"Cannab Island\" is under current terrorist attacks mostly blackmail. It wont take long before the terrorists execute more aggressive plans. A small counterterrorist unit has been dispatched to deal with the situation. Nobody knows yet what the terrorists are up to. So prepare for everything.\r\n\r\nLayout:\r\n-------\r\nThere are 3 main routes in the map: to the left rushing the beach to enter A, through the middle walking up the pier giving the opportunity to attack both A and B, to the right through the cave storming B. Both teams start closer to bomb spot A but have still a fair chance to attack/defend bomb spot B.\r\nThe map includes 40 spawns. If you want to upgrade to 64 spawns refer to 64_spawns.txt coming with this package.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n------------\r\nLow detail models makes a lot of models much simpler without affecting gameplay. Some models like the ivy fade out completely.\r\nTheres a lot of water in the map, so using cheap water can give a fps boost too.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\n---------\r\nPlease send us bugs & comments to\r\nc o n t a c t @ d 0 0 d s . c o m\r\n(remove the spaces)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to host the map for download or on your gameserver.\r\nOriginal download @ http://d00ds.com\r\n\r\nAttention Server Admins:\r\n------------------------\r\nSince the map is larger than 16MB with all the custom content, put \"net_maxfilesize 64\" into server.cfg to allow download of the map.\r\nHowever with BZIP2, it is from now on possible to compress large files which the players must download before being able to play (e.g. maps...) This way you can reduce the size of the de_rush download from 34MB to 17MB. Also the file gets downloaded from your fast webserver. That allows an enormous saving of time at the time of the remote loading.\r\n"
