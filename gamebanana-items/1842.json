Its until now the best\r\n|and savest keypad ever made.\r\n|Its so save that still then when\r\n|somebody nows the code. To\r\n|open the door or what ever you\r\n|want to protect the code have to\r\n|get entered very quickly. If the\r\n|person who wants to get access\r\n|enters the code to slowly the door\r\n|will not open anyway.\r\n|The prefabs only consists out of\r\n|brushes and functions and of\r\n|cause one prop. No difficult\r\n|logic function devices, only two\r\n|kinds of functions, doors and\r\n|buttons thats it.\r\n|There is only one thing you\r\n|have to mind, the high of the\r\n|keypad to the bottom of the\r\n|map must be exactly the high\r\n|like in my prefab otherwise\r\n|it will not working well.\r\n|So if there are any questions\r\n|or if you dont get it how this\r\n|prefab works just ask me or\r\n|wait until I have finished my\r\n|tutorial for this keypad.\r\n\r\n-Suchtkrueppel"
