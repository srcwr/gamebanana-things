I guess one reason could be those more complex than average bhop stones. But well, arrows were nice detail but doesnt effect gameplay anyhow, and bonus level wasnt such much played i guess?\r\n\r\nIf some1 knows good way to fix Too many t-junctions to fix up!, i will make version with arrows and bonus level or possible more normal levels instead. But this should be pretty ok now. Atleast seems be bug free and it still looks nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIcecreamlockÂ´s texture pack:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2605\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun =)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/subs/828542 for more maps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBhop_lunar, new concept idea map in beta stage:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/138907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDont affraid to post =)"
