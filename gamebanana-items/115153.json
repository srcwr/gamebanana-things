	"_sText": "This is a smaller effort since gg_mq_replica, though it uses the same sort of stylizations to introduce different types of game play. Included are tube launchers, ramp launchers and such triggers to propel the players through the map to reach areas essential to victory. Using the same textures as the previous  few maps (and perhaps many more after this, with slight variations), I hope to initiate new ideas into otherwise 'standard' ideals of map making.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this fast-paced map!\r\n\r\n*edit: This map has had some issues while compiling, the map has been recompiled, but is the same as it's original gg_mq_velocity, only now, fixed, better optimizations! Enjoy*"
