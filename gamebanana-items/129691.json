Fences and ladders are to scale (1 pixel=1 unit). Textures taken from Minecraft, then scaled down in paint and turned into .vtf files by me, though I'm pretty sure others have done it before.\r\n\r\nThe game with the red-and-white squares is called Spleef. Terrorists are supposed to try and knife out the squares under other Terrorists, making them fall. The button resets 10-ish squares at a time to avoid lagging the server.\r\n\r\nPretty sure the awp is not reachable. It was when I tested the map, but I was on sv_accelerate 10, because it was right after the update changed the default to 5, and I thought it was default :P."
