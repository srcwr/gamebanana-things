I touched it up a little more and optimized it a bit, so now it's good for a release. Most of the brushwork is world (not tied to entity) mainly because there's no need for bots, and it's not a competitive gameplay map.\r\nThere is a very good chance that every thing in this map is inaccurate to what a shooting range probably looks like nowadays. This is just what I had envisioned, so that's how it came out.\r\n\r\nSorry about a couple of the custom textures and their mipmaplessness. I tried for like a half hour to get them mipmapped and for some reason they just wouldn't work. \r\n\r\nInstall into your maps folder\r\n\r\nIf you find Chef Ainsley, that means you are a noclippin' fool. jk <3"
