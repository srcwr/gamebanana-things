I tried to make this as the greatest mp_shipment remake for now.\r\n\r\nThis map was made in 2 days, kinda \"speed mapping\" for me. Also, this is my first GunGame map, hope this goes to some servers with GunGame maps. Mail me the server IP if you use this map in your server.\r\n\r\nBUGS: Weird light casting in containers caused by optimizing techniques I used."
