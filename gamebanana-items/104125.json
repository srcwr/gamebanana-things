I made it in THREE DAYS... on the weekend.\r\nFirst map I've ever released that I am proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is De_StoneDust.\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\n\r\nIn an abandoned area in Africa, there resides a small computer which stores information about some rocket.\r\nThe terrorists must destroy that machine, OR the major supplies to make the machine which holds info and processes which can make a deadly rocket.\r\nThe Counter-terrorists are protecting the rocket info because of the orders from the US government.... whatever their idea was to protect the bomb.\r\n\r\nSo yeah.\r\n\r\nAnother Dust map, and I should say it's fun.\r\nHAVE FUN!"
