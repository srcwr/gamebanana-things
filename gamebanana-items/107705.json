	"_sText": "This is my third map, and my third aim map. Deffinetly my best map yet. It is very polished, balanced and pretty. It is probably my last aim map ever(probably) because I feel I am good enough to move on to better more complex maps.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe map is in the theme of Italy and uses 90% Italy textures. Its small, lots of crates to hide behind, a few areas to hide and get up ontop of and such. So please give it a go, I really think ive done well with this map, stick it on your server and I bet you'll like it."
