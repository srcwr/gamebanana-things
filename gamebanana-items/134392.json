	"_sText": "Ok, so this is just my beta version, it's really dark, and its pretty interesting. You can really only see when you are in the middle on the sides, but it's fun when you are running and run into a person and not know it. It's alot more challenging and keeps you on your toes. It gets people to use their flashlights or to use strategy to not use flashlights. Have fun! Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
