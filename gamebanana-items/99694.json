I need your comments, suggestions, and complaints so I can incorporate them all into a final version of this map.\r\n\r\nI will also try to work on the navigation mesh to assist the bots and hostages so they should be smarter in the final version. I have received little feedback on this map so I will try and see how it goes here."
