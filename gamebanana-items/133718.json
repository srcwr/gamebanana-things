You look through the grate to see more lava poring into the room! The lava underneath you begins to rise you panic and run to the nearest ladder or fan all the while having to fight off enemies!\r\n\r\nThere are 8 ways to get to the top, 4 ladders and 4 fans that blow you upwards. You must jump while on top of the fans for it to blow you."
