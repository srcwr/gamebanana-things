	"_sText": "This is a remake of my original fy_ship_mf map (http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/66384) which was made for regular gameplay and the map was too big and really just not good for gungame. After showing a few people my map they said it would be kick ass to make it good to use in gungame, so I did. I took away all the land in the map, remade the land to a much smaller area and changed the size of the skybox around the map to make the map file itself smaller. \r\n\r\noverall, the gameplay of the map is exactly the same as it was before I changed it, it only looks a little different with the different land. In the original, the land wasn't accessible, you were limited to a smaller boxed in area around the ship, but now I replaced the invisible boundaries on the old map with land. You can't get on the land, but the land gives it a bit of a realistic look to it instead of just having a square of water and no land like I originally planned for this version of the map. So really, the gameplay hasn't changed a bit, only the looks of the boundaries have. \r\n\r\nI also included in this map, buy zones just in case if you'd rather play this version of the map in regular gameplay than the original version.\r\n\r\nHave fun, leave an assessment, and try out my map. Thanks!"
