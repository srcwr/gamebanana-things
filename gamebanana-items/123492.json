	"_sText": "When I sketched this map, I had big plans.  I'm talking rotating colored lights, strobes, a disco ball; the works.  Unfortunately, that's impossible if you want your map to be playable.  However, I think that I managed to maintain a 'disco-esque' atmosphere despite these technical limitations.  I used no models whatsoever--everything was built from scratch by me.  At the time when I made this I still wasn't using nodraw (though I later optimized some of this map to reduce lag).  When I textured it, I was thinking of that disco in Scarface (the new version, of course.)  Two bombsites; one in the middle of the basement and one in the middle of the catwalks.  It's a pretty self-explanatory map.  Originally, I wanted it to be 100% realistic with nothing out of place.  However, I was forced to put glass barriers in the center of the floor to prevent spawn sniping.  Despite this, I still think that it turned out quite well."
