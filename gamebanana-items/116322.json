In \r\nthe box in the middle of the map there is a hidden breakable floor that has my clan logo \r\non it's floor. This is awsome \r\nto hide inside and shoot ppl as they run past.\r\n\r\nRange1:-\r\nRange 1 is a massive rifle range that allows you to practice with each gun available \r\nin the game. When you enter each booth a red light comes on outside above the doorway to \r\nshow there is someone in there. You will be stripped of weapons and you will find 2 buttons - \r\nthe first on the shelf gives you the gun (it has a timer so multiple weapons can be spawned);\r\nthe second (on the wall) moves the target. You press this multiple times to set the distance -\r\nthere are 4 set positions but u can press it while moving at any time to stop it. This range \r\nis excellent for showing the different effect each weapon will have when fired over\r\ndifferent distances. the teleport in has a 2 second delay to help reduce getting stuck.\r\n\r\nRange2:-\r\nWhen you enter this section you will see 4 mini ranges - \r\n\r\nthe first is a nade throwing\r\n exercise and the dummies disaper when you hit them; \r\nthe second is a target range when you hit the bull on the target a box pops down\r\nand there is a spining target than can be set at 3 difficulty levels;\r\nthe third is another type of spinning target with dummies that disappear when you hit them\r\nand again this can be set at 3 different difficulty levels;\r\nthe forth is a moving target, when you hit the dummies they disappear and this again\r\ncan be set at 3 difficulty levels.\r\n\r\nSniper pit:-\r\nThis area is a clone of the pit from dust2 but in a mirror style setup. The distance is the same \r\nas if you were awping to site A when you go in this area you have to get the awp from the \r\ndispenser and take out the enemy CT spawn one side and T the other.\r\n\r\nArea1\r\nThis is a massive area, CT spawn one side and T the other. There is a table with a button to get \r\nyour weapon. The idea is to improve your skills with m4/ak over a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs - \r\n\r\nThe nade area of the map can be seen from a certain point from the main area\r\n"
