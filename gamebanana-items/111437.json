	"_sText": "So, I decided to try and make a small, indoor map using the Art deco-style, which I as so many others have grown fond of, mainly thanks to Bioshock, the result of my experiment is this: It's a small indoor ballroom, complete with a bar, some tables, and a dancefloor. the ballroom itself is surrounded by corridors which adds some variation to the game, the doors in the map can be opened by using \"USE\" or by just nudging them a bit.\r\n\r\nA hostage situation in an underwater resort requires immediate attention, and  As soon as the players have bought their weapons, the blitz begins!"
