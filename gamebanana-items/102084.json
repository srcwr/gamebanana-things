	"_sText": "I created this as a lot of people were asking for the original 1.6 map to be remade into source. The original was made by a bloke called Lupus, so all credit for design should go directly to him.\r\n\r\nThe map is pretty much exactly the same, bar a few small updates: the rear tunnels by CT spawn now has a marketplace, and bombsite B has also been spruced up a bit. The map itself is a bit larger than original, this is simply because my judgement went slightly awry half way through: i've tried to keep the original layout as close as possible, right down to the ability to awp from the rear end (market) to the other side of the central pass at terrorists end. \r\n\r\nWe've been playtesting it with 46 and 64 players, and it seems it can handle 46 fine but 64 is pushing it a bit: you'll need a decent mid-range or high-spec Pc to run it with that many players. otherwise you shouldn't encounter any problems!\r\n\r\nHappy fragging ;)"
