	"_sText": "The terrorists spawn in a small square at the top of the map. The CTs spawn in and around a warehouse at the bottom of the map. One bombsite is right next to the CT spawn- very open and easier to cover. The other bombsite is by a church which the cts can rush to and cover quite effectively. The map is relatively small which can make for very intense firefights- but there are plenty of different routes, alcoves and hiding places to play in. There is also a passage through cellars/sewers which is very dark. Spawns for 64 players..."
