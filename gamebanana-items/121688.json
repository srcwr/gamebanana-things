	"_sText": "This is my second surf map. Again, I made it because a clanmate told me to and also because I was bored. The way I personally view this map is something along the lines of a surf_skyscraper in that it's more about the combat than the long surf sessions. This map is really free form in that I did not create any death fields, so a player can hop from ramp to ramp at will (permitting they have the speed). Therefore, a player can chase down another for the kill.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nThe map was made entirely by me, BANORRACHY. Testing and refining suggestions were givin thanks to my clanmates. Marksticked looked at it one time really quickly for the heck of it. Sonic was my inspiration for some odd reason. And my thanks go out to Sh!zz for no reason in particular.\r\n\r\n=L= The League"
