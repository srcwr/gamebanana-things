	"_sText": "I made these prefabs for my map awp_cold_creek_valley. But when i compiled the map, the barns were all messed up, so I sent it to nosoul to be fixed. He optimized the barns which fixed the problem.\r\n\r\nBut I thought that they would make a good prefab, so I took them from the map and am putting them up for the public to use. I hope you enjoy them!\r\n\r\nI made 2 barns (both fixed by nosoul), one for CT and one for T. Although you don't have to use both, just one would work. But PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT in your map for making the prefabs.\r\n\r\nTo install them for use, you just have to simply extract the file anywhere on your computer, then go into sourceSDK and click 'open' the browse to the spot you put them in and click on the file then open it. It's easiest to put them in this folder: C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\username\\sourcesdk_content\\cstrike\\mapsrc since sourceSDK opens from that folder on default, they'll be right there when you look for them."
