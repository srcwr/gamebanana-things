	"_sText": "This is a very symmetrical map. Each team has two spawn points. The big block in the center of each spawn is destructible hence the name. Also the dark barriers in the center are destructible. Personally I think this map would be best for a gun game, but it'll still work on a gun game server either way. I made it primarily to test out skies, skybox, HDR, and func_rotating."
