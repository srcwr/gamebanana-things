Each prefab is also a wooden physbox which breaks only on trigger (Might want to turn that flag off, depends on what you use it for) and has a texture scale of 0.125 for extra detail.<br><br><dt>Additional info</dt><br>The props and skybox seen in the screenshots are <a href= \"http://www.gamebanana.com/prefabs/5798\">Moroes pine trees,</a> this <a href= \"http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=51174\">foliage pack</a> from <a href= \"http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/\">Garrysmod.org</a> and the <a href= \"http://www.gamebanana.com/textures/1875\">frozen skybox texture</a> made by <a href= \"http://www.gamebanana.com/members/289553\">Komaokc.</a> <br><br>If you do decide to use this prefab in one of your maps, I'd like to be credited as appropriate and while not required, it'd be nice to told so I could see how people have used it.<br><br><center><h1>Need another winter prefab?
