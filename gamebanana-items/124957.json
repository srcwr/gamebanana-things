	"_sText": "bhop_epiphany is a large map designed to be played on autobhop settings. The map took over half a year to make due to my lack of experience. bhop_epiphany uses a filtered trigger system that disables checkpoint fallback. Visually, epiphany is a very bright map especially with HDR enabled, it also borrows many visual assets from badges maps. Game play wise, epiphany is an easy map designed so you can maintain high speed with a good route.<br><br>Please give feedback and let my know if anything is wrong.<br><br>"
