	"_sText": "Special Thanks:\r\n\r\n. Louie (design help & assistance, and for hosting the first beta map publicly)\r\n. Welshdude (for making my banner)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmg_frightnight_beta2\r\n\r\nFirst BETA played publicly on Haloween 2009 on Warmcup minigame server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest played:\r\n\r\n. In small servers\r\n. With friends\r\n. With mic\r\n. With alltalk on (sv_alltalk 1)\r\n\r\nIt's nowhere near as good when nobody uses mic.  It's best when everyone is creeping each other out and getting jumpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists have no weapons and must survive for 4 minutes by hiding and running from the three Terrorists who play as famous movie killers, Freddy Krueger (the knife), Leatherface (the chainsaw) and Jack Torrance (the axe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n. The bathroom door can be locked with a bolt on the inside of the door.  When it is locked, the Terrorists can only get in by breaking one pane of the door which mirrors a scene from The Shining.\r\n\r\n. By right clicking as a Terrorist, the players who are Freddy Krueger and Jack Torrance can shout movie quotes.  Freddy does an evil laugh taken from the school scene in the original Nightmare On Elm Street, and Jack Torrance shouts \"Here's Johnny!\"  Which is a famous quote from the bathroom scene of The Shining.  After a certain time period, right clicking as Freddy will play tense chase music from the original Nightmare On Elm Street movie.  Leatherface doesn't have a special quote or function, but the chainsaw is always buzzing which scares Counter-Terrorists as it gets closer!\r\n\r\n. There is a closet on the second floor which can be opened and Counter-Terrorists can hide inside if they are feeling brave!\r\n\r\n. The living room is in pitch black and is a good hiding spot until the TV comes on.  The TV plays the video seen in The Ring, and illuminates the room.\r\n\r\n. Other similar events can light up rooms and make Counter-Terrorists easy to spot, for example, upstairs there are two windows which the room is illuminated from when the lightning strikes.\r\n\r\n. Flashlights are disabled by default.  Terrorists search by standing far back to see players in the fog, or by hovering their crosshair over the darkness in suspect locations until names appear.\r\n\r\n. When playing Counter-Terrorist, the GSG-9 is a bad class to pick as the visor is usually visible even in the darkness, but players who are brave can pick this class!\r\n\r\n. The resident ghost lives in the attic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\nStarving Hobo\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors, problems, or you have any suggestions for the next release, please contact me by sending me a PM on my YouTube account, http://www.youtube.com/spywholovedhimself/ as I check it regularly.  Thanks! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is 4 minutes to midnight on Haloween!  A group of CTs have seeked refuge from the storm in an old haunted mansion.  Just when everything seemed okay, a huge lightning bolt struck three graves outside of the mansion!  Shocked, the CTs watched outside, as three killers rose from their graves wielding scary looking weapons!  The CTs desperately searched for their own weapons but remembered that they had lost them a long way back!  The murderers have just 4 minutes until Haloween ends and they must return to their graves for another year, but can the CTs survive for that long as they are chased and taunted in the dark scary mansion?!\""
