	"_sText": "A dust-like map that was originally made for Counter-Strike. The architecture is very simple (hence why it was made for Counter-Strike) but it recieved a little overhaul for Counter-Strike Source. The main 'feeling' of the map is archeology, hence the name 'de_archeo'. Terrorists have to bomb one of two valuable spots to win.\r\n\r\nThe map features both outside and underground spots, 2 sniping ranges, a lot of close-combat spots and very quick and intense rounds. Two bomb sites are available: (A) One in an underground tunnel where precious vases and crates of uncalculable price lay still unopened by archeologists who fled the region because of terrorist threats, or (B) an open archeology field where discovery of precious artifacts is imminent in a marked ground section.\r\n\r\n*NOTE!* This map was made for Counter-Strike (1.6) but I modified it so it will now only work for CS:Source. The architecture is very simple, so bear with it. I am currently fixing some minor issues with the map, but it's already 100% completed. I'm already working on a more detailed maps which will use displacements and the full power of the new source engine, de_archeo2."
