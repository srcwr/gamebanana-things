One stage was made by each of us and one bonus was made by sense and I each, then I detailed all of them. Each stage has a different style of surf. The first two are long and require you to maintain speed. The last two are more technical and and require precise surfing. Sense's bonus requires top precision and is sure to give anyone a challenge.</p><p>Give it a shot and tell us what you think.
