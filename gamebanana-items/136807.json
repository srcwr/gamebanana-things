	"_sText": "This is a very simple map I put together in pretty much a day, it is quite minimal but yet it has alot of tactical play.\r\n\r\nCredits to Sgt Kick Ur Ass for the smooth Corner Prefab, it's all very nice and smooth this map with good fps, the screen shots I took whilst running 21 bots so ignore my fps counter without bots I get over 200fps throughout the map.\r\n\r\nI have tested this map out with friends and bots and it is complete carnage! Go ahead and try it out... Dont think you will be dissapointed. It will work as a fight yard also which adds different gameplay again. I also tested this out with deathmatch and works pretty well too. all in all do what you like with it and enjoy.\r\n\r\nPlease assess if you are a member of fps banana\r\n\r\nRonster\r\n"
