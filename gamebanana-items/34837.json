Make a second version with a closed for bots way to the toilet?\r\n\r\nUPDATE 7.6.2014: Bots and hostages are now not cling to the bath door handle. This greatly accelerated exit/enter of bots and hostages from/to the bath.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 12.06.2014: Now hostages don't cling to the door jamb, and come out of the bath pretty fast. I will try to speed up exit of terrorists therefrom.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 12.06.2014 (second): Hooray! Now all bots fly through door of the bath like bullets! :D"
