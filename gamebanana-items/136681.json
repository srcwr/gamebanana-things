	"_sText": "Just a small map I made while I had a headache and was really bored.\r\nIts made with fast gameplay. I would recommend 10 players as a good amount but it can go up to 28 players. Although I don't think the gameplay would be good with that amount.\r\n\r\nThere is 2 maps - gg_sneak_day - It is not really light but it does not have the storm that could put you of and it does not have mist and that. It is a bit lighter but not too light. They are the first 2 screens. It does not have a nav file.\r\n- gg_sneak - This is the storm version with mist and full detail. It is the last 4 screens and it has a nav to play on.\r\n\r\nHope you like it. Please post constructive feedback. \r\nThanks; drimp.\r\n\r\nNote: Sorry for the dx 7 screens. \r\nAlso I think I forgot to put in buildcubemaps so if you get a shiny gun type it into console."
