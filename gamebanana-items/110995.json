Here's the first of hopefully several maps!<br><br><br>players: 20vs20<br><br>Now I know what you'r thinking ''It's a goddamn maze!!'' But here me out please. The maze isn't meant to get you lost, that wasn't my goal. Heck, you can even walk straight thru it! Think of it more like a series of protective walls to prevent players from getting sniped.&nbsp;<br><br>With that being said I hope that you will enjoy the map and have fun! :)<br><br>&nbsp;P.S. This map has it's secrets. So keep your eyes open!"
