	"_sText": "Recognize it? You should, it's the old Blockfort level that you played when you were young back in the 90s. This is a remake of the classic battle course for Mario Kart 64. This map has always been somewhat of a legend. I've seen it constantly remade for different games, and now its time has arrived for Counter-Strike: Source. Although unnecessary, it has HDR to beautify it. Even though I made this in about a half hour, that doesn't matter, I still had lots of fun playing 16 versus 16. Credit to Nintendo for the original design.\r\n\r\nEDIT 7/27/07:\r\nPlease redownload this, I have repackaged everything in a single BSP."
