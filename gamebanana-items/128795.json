	"_sText": "My obstacle map with 9 lvls. Gather around children and I shall tell you the story behind it. Originaly I teamed up with another mg mapper called Dr. Tran\r\nto make bob3 before bobiii was made. We were each going to build 10 levels plus a start and an end. I finished my lvls, but unfortunantly he was having computer problems so months passed and the work sat unused so eventually people were bugging me about it so i took 9 levels of mine and just threw them into this obstacle course insted of making bob3 with him. So its dev textured somewhat and its rather hard. Some levels are harder than bob2 some aren't. So dont expect to beat the map first try :). But if you can beat it come to my server which i listed below and race me.\r\n\r\nMap made a while ago releasing now\r\nSet for up to 32 spawns\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here at Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect..\r\n"
