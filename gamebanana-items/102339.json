	"_sText": "de_favela_4dm (for Death Match)\r\n\r\nThis map is a de_favela version specially modified for Death Match mode, with a special feature: The CT and T spawn areas are surrounded by gates. The gates will cycle, open for 10 seconds and closed for 50 seconds, until the end of the round. The player will spawn instantly after death as usual in Death Match, but will have to wait until the next gate opening to rejoin the action. The idea is to slower a bit that “fast-and-furious” pace of DeathMatch mode, making it more tactical and team-play oriented. Players that are waiting for the next gate opening can plan the best strategy before rejoining the action.\r\n\r\nNote: Death Match settings must be:\r\n\r\ncssdm_spawn_method \"none\" (normal spawn points, not random)\r\ncssdm_allow_c4 \"1\" (allow C4 in game)\r\nRecommended settings for round:\r\n\r\nround time: 10 minutes\r\nC4 explosion time (mp_c4timer): 90 seconds\r\nfreeze time at round start: 3 seconds or less\r\n\r\nI appreciate your feedback on this idea and on this map.\r\n\r\nIf you are not interested in Deathmatch mode, please try the \"standard\" versions (no gates) of this map:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/122140\r\n\r\n\r\n"
