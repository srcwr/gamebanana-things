There are three ways for the CTs to reach the top of the tower. A ladder on the outside of the tower, an elevator, and a ladder behind the elevator. Beware of explosive barrels.\r\n\r\nCT:  Kill the terrorists.\r\n\r\nT:  Kill the counter-terrorists.\r\n\r\nHINT: You can shoot the barrels before they fall down, killing the people who released them.\r\n\r\nAnd don't block the elevator. You'll die in exactly 0.6 seconds."
