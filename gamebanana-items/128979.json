	"_sText": "This is my first official map release. I've been mapping for about 2 months now. This map was designed with both counter terrorist and terrorist teams involved. The map is untested on jailbreak servers so balance is going to be the major improvement on the version 2 update. Subscribe to me or follow my clan's progress at www.newyorksfinest.us to give input/suggestions or to find out when the next release is coming. \r\n\r\nPlease leave thoughtful suggestions such as \"this map needs more cells,\" \"this map is too bright,\" \"I really love the layout,\" \"this map favors one team more than the other,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI would love for the communities input so I can edit the next version of the map.\r\n\r\nMy steam name is Imabustya (addme) but i am also known as prisoner #31765 as shown on the map.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to -New York's Finest- clan and to all my best steam friends (you know who you are). \r\n\r\nAlso special thanks to the mapper who made ba_jail_electric_VIP which is my favorite jailbreak map and the map that made jailbreak my favorite css gametype.\r\n\r\nCheck me out playing css jailbreak on youtube! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX0QZZVWZug"
