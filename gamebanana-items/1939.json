	"_sText": "SO this is my first addition to FPSBanana, an extremely simple prefab that you can add to your maps to give it a bit more life!\r\n\r\nIt is basically a Half Life 2 cop That follows a square route (this can be modified at will tho using path_track entitites) and is synced with his animation in such a way that you have a perfect patrolling HL2 cop! He cannot be killed or stopped, however he is solid, so take my advice, or do like i did, and place him somewhere unreachable to players (for instance in my PB maps, i would usually have him patrolling the fences in outdoor areas, adds effect dontchaknow ^^)\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you enjoy it, find a use for it, or may be inspired to create something better by it!\r\n\r\nOh and as is custom, a small mention if used in a map would make my day :D"
