The map have 40 levels.\r\n\r\nI hope you have fun with this map.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLXysqmEyt0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nI considered to make a extend version of the map because i like the style so very much.\r\nBut i am not so sure about it does another will like it. It would be nice when someone can write a his opinion to this idea.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to\r\n\r\nAbsolute and Warmach1ne"
