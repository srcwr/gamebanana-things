	"_sText": "This is a standard DE map with 2 bombsites and 64 spawn points. Each bombsite has at least 3 points of entry. This map was meticulously rebuilt from the ground-up to be very close to the original de_survivor by 3D Mike. Thorough beta testing shows that framerates are well within the acceptable range for serious play, but you can expect this map to be as taxing as de_nuke or de_inferno. This map was created for and is in rotation at the [DoP] High Times servers.\r\n\r\nNote that while this map does come with a .NAV file, it is not optimized. Bots are over-rated.\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\nA high priority informant has been shot down by enemy forces in a remote mountainous area. A local private security force has been contracted by the US to be America's first response in bringing the plane crash survivor into custody for interogation. The survivor has locked himself in the cockpit of the plane wreckage.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorist objective is to secure the immobilized target until the 2nd American team arrives.\r\n\r\nTerrorist objective is to execute the target or otherwise prevent his extraction by US forces."
