You can fill it with whatever you like. Just change the entity info..Great for aim_ak_colt maps or any map where guns are laying around. Have a nice place to store them LOL...Even though some of the weapons will be given to you before you open the box its kinda cool. Its also fun to have it in the open and use it as something to hide behind. Shoot and hit the use key to bring up your protection..Thank you for checking it out. "
