	"_sText": "This map is currently in beta phase. It is a redo of a map I made previously but I decided to go with dev textures this time as I noticed with all the various sight lines it felt cluttered. Looking for feedback of all kinds, good and bad. This map is large and not suggested for people that are not patient or who are not skilled enough to not fall to their deaths. I like where the map is now, but am looking for feedback as to what might make it more fun. \r\nThank you to Komaokc who created the skybox I am using. I try to use custom skyboxes on my dev texture maps and went with this one because of the quality and the similarity in color to my map. \r\nAll comments left on changes will be considered.\r\nIF feedback after a couple weeks is positive I will change this maps status to final.\r\n  "
