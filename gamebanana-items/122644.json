Make sure to get the newer bsp!</b></font>\r\n<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"1\">\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nBigloop 2008\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nRemade from scratch by Paper-Cut, with permission from FAJ.\r\nFAJ oversaw every aspect of this remake, from the texturing to making sure the gameplay of the original stayed as perfect as it was in v6 of the original.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nThis map is all about ramp combat, so if you like skill maps because you have to have \"talent\", then go home.\r\n\r\nGet ready for speed, blood, and a face full of shotgun shells. Grab yourself an M3 and jump into the madness.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nMap designed for 66tick, will work fine on 100tick.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nThanks goes out to:\r\n\r\nFAJ, for letting me remake the map\r\nEtrigan, for ideas and testing\r\nSintaxError, for helping me with various things along the way.\r\nTurkey Eater, for the text idea.\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit Solidsurf.info for more great surf maps and surf mapping tutorials.</font>\r\n"
