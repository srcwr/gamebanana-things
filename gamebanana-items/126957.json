	"_sText": "I would like to thank half-evil for giving me this wonderful idea. First of all this isnt a normal deathrun map. This map requires autobalance because Ct's and T's race to get to the end first. In the beginging there are 2 teleports for each side to work with buttons.The map is mirrored so its equal and not unbalanced for each team. If everyone on both sides dies the button pushers get killed so there isn't a stalemate waiting for the time to run out. This map is also quite difficult and requires some skill. Its possible to beat just hard.I highly suggest testing on a server because it won't make sence doing by yourself.\r\nSome features of map:\r\n-buttons cant be hogged by the same person every round(random)\r\n-interesting traps. shoop de woop,rick roll'd to death,slide like dodgeing,xc at end.(not too hard), and other challenging traps\r\nIm also wondering if other mappers will change there map to this format or if i can get permission to do that pm me. have fun deathruning.\r\nOh and heres a server that plays it. so far its extremely fun and everyone likes it. youtube video soon.\r\nnot advertising. just a good server to try the map.\r\n74.63.68.90:27015"
