	"_sText": "I designed this map on graph paper from the start, setting up the boxes in a way that would be fun to play in. Once it was finished I wasn't going to finish the map, I was just going to trash it, but Tr33t (glitch) said he'd take them and finish them. A little ways into the map he suggested that we should make this a group project.\r\n\r\nThe fy_deagle_x9 project is going to be a set of 4 different deagle maps all specially designed by me. I made the boxes and alligned them properly, then tr33t put in the lighting, the walls, the floor and the roof. I finished it by putting in the bridge over the boxes, adding cubemaps, and putting in spawn points then making the .nav file. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it!"
