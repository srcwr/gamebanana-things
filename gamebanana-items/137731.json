The abbreviation was required as there already is a map named surf_blackandwhite (it has nothing to do with it though). <br><br>It's a single-run surf map with an extra bonus level in the middle of the circuit.<br><br>I hope yall like this map, it was a very old project that got abandoned and picked up almost 7 years later... still, it's one of the maps I dedicated my best efforts to finish!<br><br>Happy surfin'!"
