It took me 2 days, but this is the end result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Two teams start at each end of the elevator shaft. Ladders and a stairwell connect both of those ends. This map is mainly close quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n It isn't exactly bot friendly. The terrorist team tend to stay on their spawn floor and the counter-terrorist team tend to hop down to the 3rd floor and shoot at every breakable object they see.\r\n\r\n\r\n 2 Easter eggs are hidden in the map. Let me know if you find them :D\r\n\r\n\r\n Enjoy playing and please don't hesitate to give constructive criticism. It's the only way I can get better."
