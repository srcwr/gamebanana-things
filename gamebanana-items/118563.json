I ended up by adding an underground passage and an \"fy iceworld\" based layout on top, these changes will make the map more dynamic and less boring (hopefully).\r\n\r\nIn terms of lightning and visuals I made an effort to keep the map nor too bright nor dark. I also added cubemaps to perfect it a bit, and have the scopes reflecting world.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it,\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
