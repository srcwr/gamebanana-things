There are 2 bombsites, one in the room across from the kitchen and one upstairs.  This map was originally going to be a deathmatch one, but I realized that although deathmatch is indeed possible, it has become too big to be w/out a bombsite.\r\n\r\nPM me for any map requests you may have or for any mapping questions.\r\n\r\n!!! THIS MAP INCLUDES A NAV FILE !!!"
