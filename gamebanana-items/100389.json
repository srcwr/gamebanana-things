	"_sText": "This map is a \"double\" remake. HAVONAR created a called map CS_RIO_CSS, based on the old map CS_RIO for CS 1.6, that it was built by MATALEONE... But cs_rio_css was build VERY different, seeming a desert, not at all remembering a shanty-town. I improved and I repaired many mistakes that the map Cs_rio_css had, and now he is approximated of the original of MATALEONE, remembering a shanty-town, with original map songs (however some differences stay).\r\n\r\nAuthor HAVONAR'S e-mail is: havonar at hotmail.com\r\n\r\nAny suggestion to FINAL version please mail me at: games_developer at pop.com.br \r\n\r\nhttp://site.pop.com.br/games_developer"
