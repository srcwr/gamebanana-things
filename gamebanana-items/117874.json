If you could help me with this contact me\r\nwith the link below.\r\n(steamcommunity.com/id/kyleistheshadow)\r\nName: measure_crysis_v1\r\nFeatures: Custom Textures (let me know if you have issues with this *black & purple*)\r\nOn the roof of a brick building there is a orange texture with a body in it, it's a hint that you can go though\r\nthat wall and inside.\r\nBreakable wall near T spawn, next to a ladder.\r\n*My favorite*: The breachable door at T spawn, you'll see it there as a wooden door. Shoot at/near the \r\nhandle to break the door open to go inside. Otherwise it will not open. (Pretty cool right? ya.)\r\nMany advantages and engagement areas. Get to know the map and it should be fun.\r\nBots do pretty well with the map, give it a try. (they love the big building)"
