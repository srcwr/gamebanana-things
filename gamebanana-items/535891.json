This is my final map. After this I'm done from mapping for sure.<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>Map Contains~</b></span><br>2 Stages:<br><ul><li class=\"SelectedElement\">&nbsp;Segment I - Initial</li><li>Segment II - Dream</li><li>Practice Mode.</li></ul>Laser Ending on Segment I<br>RNG Ending on Segment II - New Cubes and Spirit Bomb RNG from Dragon Ball Z. lol<br>2 Human Items ( Fire, Ice Beam).<br>Susanoo Boss Fight on Segment - II<br>Defend Holds.<br>64 Spawns.<br><br>I made this map comparatively easier for humans so even 10 humans will manage to win. However, the last hold on Segment II may be hard for less players. If people give feedback, I would add 3rd stage which I initially decided to add but I don't want to drag and make the map longer.
