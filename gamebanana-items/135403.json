	"_sText": "My 2nd map release. This one is a little more detailed. Had some problems with the doors in it, so I took them out. I left 1 door in at the CT spawn so the flow of encounter stays even. I think it does the job\r\n\r\nstand on the door when its gonna close, its coooool. hahah\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback on what you think I could do to make this map better and all. Yea i don't seem to do well with refective surfaces and cubemaps, if someone has any wisdom on cubemaps then please share. I have followed tutorials on making them exactly as stated, and I still suck at it!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks everyone. More maps are soon to come!"
