There are grenades spawned on the ground already so those wont be a problem.\r\n\r\nTheres a special effect thats added, including these \"weird\" textures that I used for eg the basketball lines, and the background sort of \"traces\" itself back, after being a little bit swirvy, in other words, what you see trails it self a little bit, HOWEVER, if you have VERY low fps like me (30 fps) then the trails will be long and slaggy, high fps, even just 70 and up, will have PERFECT trails.\r\n\r\nNOTE: IF YOUR FPS IS TOO HIGH THEN YOU MAY MISS SOME OF THE EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n!! NOTE: IF YOU ARE SEEING THE LINES AS WHITE, THATS OK, BUT IT MEANS THAT YOUR GRAPHICS SETTINGS ARE TOO HIGH FOR THE WEIRD COLOR, THIS <b><u>DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING</U></B>!!"
