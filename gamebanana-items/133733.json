The arena is high in the air, that's why there is a volumetric fog hovering on the ground, highly great detail.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the team, and those who inspired me to make this map.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in my other map: castle_base_b2 feel free to view over that as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading and have fun!\r\nDuck of source development team\r\n\r\nP.S.- If you are interested in viewing the official souce development mapping team website: http://halomoddingsite.com/meteoraCSS/index.php\r\n\r\nAlso I have some tutorials on mapping that you can watch if you're interested in: http://www.firedraco21.proboards102.com/index.cgi?board=cssmapmakingmodding"
