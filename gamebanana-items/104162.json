	"_sText": "A while ago I had the idea to create a map with the ability to recognize the player's actions, and change accordingly. This resulted in de_struction, my prefix for Bomb/Defusal maps, with fake DMM.\r\n\r\nBasically, this map is an office ripoff with walls that break apart. It supports up to 10 players at any time, and is fully-functioning, with buyzones and a bombsite.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking to improve it, and make more maps like it. (Although, a bit more inspired & complete.)\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this map is nowhere near complete, nor do I intend for it to be a competitive map.\r\n\r\nThanks to 3kliksphilip for the idea.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you can help me out in any way/shape/form then please add me on steam or comment below.
