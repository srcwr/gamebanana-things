	"_sText": "After the great support of Harrisonbrtn and his ideas, I could finally finish this map.\r\n\r\nIt contains HDR, and is fully optimized.\r\nIt's not big in size, but with it's 100 ways and many objects to hide behind such as stairs and ladders that affect the gameplay it's not only a good-looking map, but also one with very much interesting gameplay sides.\r\n\r\nThe story:\r\nWell when I came into my classroom, the previous teacher (art) has painted a overview of \"a kind of a map\" on the table. When I saw it I got inspirated and made a map out of it. Lol.\r\n\r\n<s>Update 01/07/2009:\r\nAdded new BSP with visual updates, no redownload required.</s>"
