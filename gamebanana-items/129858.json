	"_sText": "[b]The map has been updated because of balancing issues. Both teams should have an equal chance of winning now.[/b]\r\n\r\nHello all,\r\n\r\nThis is my first map made in Source SDK. I think it was extremely difficult for a first timer to construct, but i think i did pretty well for my first map.\r\n\r\nSo here I present Jailbreak Asylum V2 (I hope the name isn't taken...)\r\n\r\nMake sure to read the ReadMe file for proper setup.\r\n\r\n[b]MAP FEATURES[/b]\r\n===================================================================================\r\n- Standard cell doors made from props that open at the push of a button. There are 16 cells. (and 16 CT spawn points) for a maximum of 32 players.\r\n- Central arena -- This area is marked on the mini-map. It can be used for nearly anything. Be it guntoss, highest spreay, shot for shot you name it. Everything happens in the arena.\r\n- Solitary confinement -- Solitary confinement is in the center of the arena with the 2 large metal doors. The buttons for the doors are located on either side of the cell door button marked \"A\" and \"B\".\r\n- One way glass -- Most of the CT paths go behind T territory and the CT's are able to view a T up close without a T knowing due to one way glass. Look at last screenshot to see what i mean.\r\n- Weapon recovery annex -- Make a weapon fall into the crack on the red side of the map and proceed to the lower level where the CT's spawn to retrieve it.\r\n- Empty weapon pit -- Nothing much, just a hole to throw empty guns into, because i hate accidentally picking up an empty weapon.\r\n- A few secrets and easter eggs -- You'll have to find them yourself ;)\r\n- There is no V1 so don't look for it. (I called it V2 cause i had a map similar to this but it became FUBAR)\r\n\r\n[b]OTHER NOTES[/b]\r\n===================================================================================\r\n- Feel free to optimise the map for Garry's Mod. Just make sure to give me credit.\r\n- I'm open for compilations with other's if your interested. My steam name is INSTAGIBmaniac. If you have any questions comments, email me at chew-mann@hotmail.com. Please try to be positive!"
