	"_sText": "My fourth map, put together quick as a fun little gun game map in a swampy area. Two sniper towers, home bases for spawn points, a curious well, and 2 feet of water everywhere. \r\n\r\nEnjoy this fun little place to play, made during the great Source SDK update crash with no model viewer!\r\n\r\nv1 UPDATE: Alright, it took a while, but here's the update. I added 8 more spawn points, 3-D skybox, ambient sounds, and A LOT more light. That should do it!"
