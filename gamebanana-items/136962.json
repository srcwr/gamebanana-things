Took me around 12 hours total, and is a lot cleaner than my last map (yeah, let's not speak of that again >.>). 6 spawns on either side, buyzones if you don't want to play gungame on it (though i don't advise that, it's not very well suited to normal css) and that's about it..not exactly advanced but I'm getting better :)"
