The CT can go to a secret room with buyzone as well. when the T have completed the maze, they push a button and goes into a room with the bombzone (watch the water, or else you COULD get killed, because there is where you come from after visiting the buyzone) plant the bomb quickly amd push the button under the arrow. a huge block will come up and block the path for the CT (exept for a space big as a door) making it easyer to suvive for the TÂ´s.\r\nIf you need help finding secret areas, send a PM."
