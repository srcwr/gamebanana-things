	"_sText": "A Fun mg map where both teams spawn across a field with knives and try to knife the other team while the ground breaks off opening up crevices that players fall through to a lava death. Its fast paced rounds and fun randomness. The crevices open up randomly between 5 and 20 seconds so the map is a bit random each round making it entertaining. The more people the more fun it is when they all fall through a crack. Took 45 minutes to make. (Spawns set up for 20v20 so go crazy with the server size)"
