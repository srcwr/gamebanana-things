It's one of the first i had played on and offered a small, simple, fast paced experience, which began my love of Gungame. Can call this a tribute to that map.\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528. Thanks for the textures.\r\n\r\nBased on mini_house.\r\n\r\nCustom Textures added with Pakrat.\r\n\r\nSpawn Points: 50\r\n"
