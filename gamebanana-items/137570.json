	"_sText": "This map is one of our most popular maps. So I uploaded the original here figuring to be nice and share it. Then I got complaints about the all bright from reviewers here. So I have created an enhanced version with custom lighting. I also added a breakable glass rail to the back crosswalk for cover and a box on the center crosswalk. This version ALSO includes a buyzone for those that may need it for other game types. I do not intend on modifying it further.\r\nIf you like it great! Enjoy it."
