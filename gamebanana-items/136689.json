	"_sText": "This is a very small, close-range map I made for gun game in Counter-Strike: Source. The map is almost completely symmetrical, and includes: breakable vents, vent shafts, arched hallways, underground tunnel, bullet-proof windows (with ricochet sounds), and snow. This is my second map, and I like to think I'm getting better, so leave me some comments. This will make for a really fast gun-game round."
