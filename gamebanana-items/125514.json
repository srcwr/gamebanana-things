I got bored and wanted to make a bit of a longer map so I spent a few days working on this, it's pretty straight forward and has a big block style, the map is easy to beat in general but hard to do fast. I intended for it to be a one shot map, but decided to add a few checkpoints here and there because I knew some people would complain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The bonus was originally made by Dream for a surf project of mine, it was then modified by ArcticPanda and finally changed slightly by me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Map should be doable on all styles, just keep in mind the map is intended to be ran with a lot of speed so if you keep failing you might find yourself pre-speeding a lot."
