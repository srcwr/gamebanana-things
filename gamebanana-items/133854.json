	"_sText": "This is kind of an assault/fightyard map I use for gungame on my server.  Map includes a 3D skybox, many ladders, arched columns to hold up the structure and alot of stairs.  Its really a fun map.  The teams spawn  on opposite sides, its not a random spawn.  Spawns are pretty well protected from spawn killers.  Indoor & outdoor play area.  I was really pleased with the way the skybox lined up.  The road looks as if its part of the map the way it extends into the 3D area.  Max of 24 players, and also includes a nav file.  I'm open to all constructive criticism.  "
