	"_sText": "This map is my first completed map on source sdk. I think for my map level it's a successful map. The counter terrorists get m4a1's while the terrorists get ak47's. There are many small gaps for picking which is what I have planned to do to improve peoples aim. There is also a few fun things in the map, such as the big pit in the middle. The buttons on top of the walls behind the spawn points smash the glass and make you vunrable to fall down the pit. I hope you enjoy playing my map.\r\n\r\nReport bugs etc to me, thanks\r\n\r\nDaniel Paine."
