Sorry!\r\n\r\nThis map is a lot like the old arcade game \"Jump Man\"  It is pretty fun.\r\n\r\ni made the original version as a prototype for another map, and it turned out to be quite fun.  I updated it for the Gamers syndicate or [G`SyN] because they are so great.\r\n\r\nfixes:\r\n*Textures... a whole lot of texture fixes\r\n*The Terrorists buttons now take 2 seconds, rather then 1.25 seconds to reset, making barrel spam a lot less of an instance.\r\n*the firepit has been fixed\r\n*and a fun new grenade ending!"
