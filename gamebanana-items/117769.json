	"_sText": "Well, i made this map for my server but because it is so musch fun i decided to upload it. This map is small, with only 8 spawn points per side, and was made with fast action in mind. The tipical match lasts less than 30 seconts, depending on how aggressive the players are. \r\n\r\nAT A GLANCE\r\n16 spawn points total\r\nskybox\r\nanimated sky\r\nunderground passage\r\nhidden goodies\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\nDue to SPAWN KILLING n00b, Ivan, i have added metal covers over the windows that break with 1 shot. All this does is prevents a AWPer from finding his target before the game starts. If you played this map on my server, that is about the only thing i have changed, that and i toned down the strength of the underground blockers and added a arrow to help the n00bs find it.
