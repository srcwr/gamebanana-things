	"_sText": "This is basicly iceworld but its cell shaded. I thought it would be a cool idea to have iceworld cellshaded so I did it....was an easy job:\r\n-10 Minutes for the \"iceworld layout\"\r\n-30 minutes for the Cell Shading\r\n-10 minutes for the Lighting \r\n-1 day for the overview (Had to figure out how to do it xD)\r\n\r\nI think its looks very cool with the lightning and cell shading together.\r\nI didnt want to just decompile fy_iceworld and apply cellshading to it. So I created it from scratch.\r\nTheres a Bombzone in the Middle but you fiest have to break the floor (200 health)\r\nAlso to improve gameplay I added ladders to the four blocks. Its much fun to play this map. I included the .nav file so you can play with bots :)\r\n\r\nWell....anything else.....then...\r\nHave Fun!\r\n\r\n"
