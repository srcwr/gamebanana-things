	"_sText": ".:. Surf Funhouse .:.\r\n\r\nThis map is a funhouse themed map, with various obstacles throughout the surf, including an upside-down section of surf.  The jail is a red-light-green-light minigame, which is fairly self-explanatory.  I have added lasers to the jail which activate after 2.5 minutes to keep rounds shorter. The map has a secret or two.\r\n\r\nI'd like to thank everyone at SolidSurf Studios, most of all SintaxError and FAJ.\r\n\r\nAlso, many thanks to the Akron Community, found at www.waspnest.net, especially Wasp and Platinum.\r\n\r\nMade for 66 tick servers.\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the map to your C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\YOUR NAME\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps directory.\r\n\r\n***The map is decompile protected, don't even think about it!***\r\n\r\nDirect any questions to http://forums.solidsurf.info, or send me a pm.\r\n\r\nLook for a v2 with longer surf in the future!\r\n\r\n-[UDel] Steve"
