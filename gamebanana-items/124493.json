	"_sText": "<p>Hey guys, second map here. First off just want to say thanks to Bugga for making that awesome texture pack, it looks very nice. Secondly thank you pcpie for the prefab. Also want to note that I didn't know what a good name was so I ended up making it my name.</p><p>On the 2nd level after the surf the blue blocks are the little boosters, every telehop can be telehopped but i believe the one leading to the 3rd stage is a 180 or 360 one, I forget i havent tested that out too much myself. As etho said on my last map i should put a portal to my bonus in the spawnzone so i did.&nbsp;</p><p>Map wr (on my server) is currently 34 seconds, but for most people the map is 40-50 seconds.</p><p>** you do need to crouch boost on the green level.</p>"
