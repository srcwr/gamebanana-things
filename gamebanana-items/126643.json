Yes by scratch. here is is everyone,\r\n\r\nThe map involves terrorists as being jail mates, and they can rebel anytime. Either going up the stairs and across the hallway to another room, or go through another hallway and you can see a ladder going to the roof. There is basically 2 ways getting in and out. (I lied' there is a vent that cts can come in only). The jails are extremely cool to be in. The cts can charge a bomb (By pressing E on the bomb, on the right side to blow it up in \"3\" seconds, so they can rush in and kill the rebelers that are inside on the bottom floor. Basically this map is really epic and you need to play it to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n{RATE MAPS FAIRLY AND JUST - Spread the word}\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it! \r\n\r\nSlots\r\n16+ CT\r\n16+ T\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE {BETA 3}\r\n\r\n-Fixed S4S\r\n-Fixed some lighting (again)\r\n-Added/Fixed escape route roof\r\n-Some more details\r\n-Upgraded t 2nd floor escape\r\n-Fixed some glitches\r\n-Changed the pit\r\n-New small secrets?\r\n\r\n**PICTURES ARE BETA2 AND NOT BETA3**"
