	"_sText": "ZM Vampire Medical v3 is a heavily modified version of sm medical 1 from the 2004 game Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines by Troika Games. It features a complete re-work of it's original optimization because the nodraw texture didn't exist when it was created, multiple bug fixes with the brushwork, and plenty of cade spots.\r\n\r\nThe map has been enlarged 1.1x it's original size to make the hallways wider by 10 units, unnoticeable to the eye but noticeable through gameplay. This map focuses on teamwork more than soloing. The map itself is very well balanced, and has gone through many tests on different populated servers."
