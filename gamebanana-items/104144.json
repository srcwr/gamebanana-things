I left it out for FPSB, because it was distracting.\r\n__________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIf you have any thoughts I would love to hear them, and please consider the above list when playing, if you do.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the gameplay, I think it is fun how I setup the sites. \r\n\r\nAny comments would be accepted, especially criticism."
