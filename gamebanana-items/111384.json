I decided to turn part of Half Life 2's City 17 into a Counter-Strike: Source map, so, here it is. This map is still in testing, so if you see any problems, email me or message me at any of the below. Thanks. \r\n\r\nTextures:\r\nI don't believe you guys need any extra textures, but if you do, let me know and I'll get you the ones you need if they aren't showing up.\r\n\r\nLegal Agreement:\r\nI don't care, it's my seventh actual completed map, it can be distributed to whomever you wish, BUT, give credit where credit is due, to me (if you do distribute it), and any other credited sources listed above.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\nIf you have any, please let me know.\r\nAIM: Hum4n01dTyph00n\r\nemail: jasonscholefield@gmail.com"
