	"_sText": "An alien hive now dominates the city centre. With civilisation destoyed by these grotesque parasites only small pockets of survivors remain. Its hopeless....\r\n\r\nDeep within the alien hive a new breed of hunter-killer hybrids are being incubated, and when they hatch there will be no way of defeating them...\r\n\r\nThis is a new version that is a zombie escape map instead of zombie mod. It is similar to atix. Ct's must activate the radio and call for helicopter evac before this sector is nuked. The radio is at the top of the tall castle like building.\r\n\r\nSongs: \r\n\"Memory II\"\r\n\"Kyrie\"\r\n\"Someone Calls Me... Someone Looks For Me\" from Parasite Eve. All composed by Yoko Shimomura"
