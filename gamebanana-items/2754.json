	"_sText": "Trying to make a map for the Dangerous Cargo contest. And so I needed a truck. Made by using the clipping tool in Hammer.\r\nAs you might already have discovered, it looks quite similiar to the one on the contest page, that is because it is the picture I used to make this.\r\n\r\nI have made the doors open when pressed, mirrors on each side and the lights as you can see at the front. The wheels are just brushes and the rest is a physic box and one overlay. It is up to you to make it move or however you see fit for your map.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to any questions or comments added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Prefaber](http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ico/medals/monthly_award.gif \"\")"
