And decided to call it aim_buddha. SInce its based on aim_noob and i have no idea who the author of it was/is i can only writte unknown. Thanks to whoever you are for my first experience with css. \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAim_buddha is a fast action map two flanks for each side and also a stair on both sides to go up on the walls. It has a open arena with cover walls on both sides and is kept in the popular de_dust styled geometry. \r\nCan be used for Normal Gameplay / Team-Deathmatch(maybe not too good) / GunGame \r\nWould be very happy to see my first map getting played on just one server.\r\n------------------------------\r\nINSTALL\r\n------------------------------\r\nPlace the bsp and nav file in cstrike/maps\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nDiffrences from the original and to the remake:\r\nMap has info_nodes for bots\r\nMap has cubemaps\r\nMap has light\r\nMap has now also has Fog\r\nMap is open\r\nMap has a little more detail and a little more walkable areas\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe Map has 9 spawns for both teams so the map doesnt get crowded too much\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSince this is my first release of css maps dont be too hard :)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSyntaxError"
