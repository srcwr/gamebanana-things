I made it for our GG server. \r\nThis is a dark map and has 32 spawn points.\r\n\r\nThis map contains 2 spawn sections on opposite ends of the main fighting area which is lowly lit. It also has 2 halls going down each side which are even less lit. \r\n\r\nThere is a tall platform in the middle that overlooks most of the map.\r\n\r\nThis map should provide lots of knifing opportunities.\r\n\r\nI was going for gameplay and quick games instead of \"purdyness\".....\r\nperhaps the next one will have more eye candy"
