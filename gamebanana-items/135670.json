	"_sText": "Gg_maniacal is a map with 3 main \"corridors\" or lines of fire. 2 side ones and a central \"shooting range\". There are lots of nooks to take cover in or camp in. \r\n\r\nThe sides of the map also have a 2nd story. Snipers and \"flankers\" will learn to use this to their advantage.\r\n\r\nMake a rush to the central bridge, and you'll find the one-way windows very helpful. You can see out but they cant see in!\r\n\r\nDont forget that the Terrorist and CounterTerrorist spawn-bunkers have oneway windows too. Especially when you have chosen the central lane.\r\n "
