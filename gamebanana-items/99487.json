The map is pretty small to actually be an airport, but is fun gameplay and looks pretty good. \r\n\r\nThe map has custom textures and custom props, and a good nav-file. Just see the pictures...\r\n\r\nThe hostages can be found in the office at the 1st floor. \r\n\r\n- Install\r\nTo install simply extract the two files (.BSP and .NAV) here: C:\\Programs\\Steam\\SteamApps\\ (STEAM NAME) \\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n- Credits\r\nMap, nav and custom textures was made by The Wormhole Studios.\r\nThe Ford Victoria Taxi prop was not made by The Womrhole Studios, but it is a pretty old model so we do not know who made it, sorry.\r\n\r\n"
