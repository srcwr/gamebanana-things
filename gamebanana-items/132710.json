	"_sText": "I stayed away from my usual way of mapping, and tried to make a realistic setting for people to be in.  I wanted to create a dark, scary map giving people the idea of what an actual zombie setting might be.  There are spots to hide and barricade over the map, but you will have to truly look for them and think out of the box to use them unlike other maps.  There are no cheap spots and everything is fair. Fight for your survival in this dark eerie map. Your flashlight is your FRIEND at ALL times. Good luck and enjoy the map."
