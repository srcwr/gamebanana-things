	"_sText": "Mean terrorists have decided to blow up convenient resort. Terrorist are gonna blow up nice small restaurant at the pool area or the sauna. CTs have to stop terrorists and defend the resort for last man.\r\n\r\nMmmm yeah , This map was in fact a New Year project that delayed. I started in November but I took little break which delayed and delayed. If I'm honest , I bought CoD4 and started to play that D: and later MW2. Yeah but I tried to make this map balanced and fun to play , there's 5-6 secrets(not so sure xD) to find but please don't use noclip C; One secret is code locked door in the middle of map. I have hidden 6 numbers in the map and 2 numbers are wrong. You can only try 4 times / round to open door ,and if 4th time is failed , the door jams and you can try out on next round. And..... mm I'm not gonna tell you all :O It's up to you to find those secrets , Good luck\r\n\r\n\r\nTaikuri"
