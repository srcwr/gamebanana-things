However you can easily generate one by typing in console. \"nav_generate\" This will generate a NAV file for the bots.\r\n\r\nThis map has been designed to cater:\r\n\r\n- Bomb plantation/ Defusal\r\n- Hostage rescue\r\n- Weapon kill streaks\r\n\r\nI have tested this map. And got 4 achievements doing so. :)\r\n\r\nAny questions please leave a comment or pm me and I will get back to you ASAP.\r\n\r\nHappy cheating the achievement system :)\r\n\r\nHolds:\r\n4 TERRORISTS\r\n25+ COUNTER-TERRORISTS.
