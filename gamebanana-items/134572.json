	"_sText": "All Pictures, including Property Cards, Money, Chance and Community Chest Cards, the monopoly board itself, and the name \"Monopoly\" are owned and copy-write Parker Brothers and it's subsidiary, Hasbro.  I do not claim to own any material within this map.  All images used for texturing were scanned and imported locally with physical pieces except for the Dice texture which was, in fact, made myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\nThis File Has been updated from it's original.  The Download will feature the \"Redux\" version of BGSmonopoly.  If you have a server with this map, I offer you this as a replacement as the horrible glare from HDR Rendering has made the oroginal map less then perfect.  I appologise for taking so long to fix this problem, but I had other maps I wanted to finish as they were fresh in my mind.\r\n***\r\n\r\n"
