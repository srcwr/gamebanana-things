	"_sText": "A jump map I made with a cliff/ Aztec theme.\r\nThis map took me a wile but when finished I was really happy with the results.\r\n\r\nThis map is not a vain-busting jump map where you will go completely insane over a jump, instead, It is a casual stride map where you can sit back, and enjoy a nice 30 minute jump with friends.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to the top, you can pick up your well earned scout and grenade and if you want, you can go to the extra jump room i included while waiting on others to finish, once done with that, you will be teleported on the cliffs to watch over the map.\r\n\r\nI hope you have as much fun as I did making this.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Doomsday and Frosty for helping to test this map."
