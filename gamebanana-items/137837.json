This is surf_loweffort, a map that, as the name suggests, was made within a week or so. As for the difficulty, I reckon it floats somewhere between tier 3 and 4. I hope you enjoy playing this map just as much as I did making it!<br><br>Thanks to the testers: kalle, soap, Helmie, BlackIce, liam, Julian, aimzAKAR and everyone else I forgot!<br>Also thanks to Sam for pitching in a stage which ended up becoming stage 5. :)<br><br>Check out this awesome video made by merky!
