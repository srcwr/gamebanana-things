There are 3 surf areas and 1 room at the end, there are also a few hidden rooms with guns in them so keep your eyes out.\r\n\r\nThis is only beta 2 so if you find any bugs, please e-mail me at shifts.games@gmail.com if you find any. If no one finds any I am going to leave it at Beta 2 and not release a final unless I see a reason.\r\n\r\n + Sh|fty"
