I think the map will speak for itself.\r\n\r\n-- August 13, 2009 --\r\nBeta2 Released:\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n- Changed office bookcase to prop_static (doesn't move when you shoot it)\r\n- Added a small library, garbage room, and laundry area in empty rooms\r\n- Fixed the hidden T-buyzone (works properly now)\r\n- Fixed pool teleport to make it less difficult to hit from the diving board\r\n- Increased length of hidden ledge in kitchen to make it easier to get to sniper spot.\r\n\r\nFixes still needed:\r\n- Shadow problem in infirmary (can see beds through the floor)\r\n- Infirmary overhaul, needs to be made prettier. (too empty for my tastes)."
