	"_sText": "Hello everyone!<br><br>This is new remake for CS:S of one popular BF3 map \"Noshahr Canals\". I worked with this map around nine weeks and she still not finished, now only in beta stage, maybe 90% of the map is now completed.&nbsp;The reason why I upload not completed map now is because in close future I have not chance to finish her. I know that on map exist a few non critical bugs which I planning to fix when again resume work on this map.<br><br>Gameplay note: you can use containers doors to rise the roofs of containers, I just not created a proper sign which can mark this. In archive you also will find manually tuned bots .nav file.<br><br>Good game!<br><br><br><br>"
