	"_sText": "**THIS IS THE SECOND BETA, NOT THE FINAL**\r\n\r\nSo I've added some more things underground, aswell as an entire 3rd underground level, and reworked some textures/lights.  Same deal as before, let me know if you find any texture glitches or map glitches.  Rating is appreciated :)\r\n\r\nEnvironmental sounds and the fire sound still isnt working properly. I'm working on it.\r\n\r\nI realize there are a few low FPS spots. I'm new to hints and skips so their not all over the place, but they are in some key areas.  I'm still looking for someone to help me optimize my map, so if your interested please drop a message on my page and based on your reputation and mapping skills, you could get the spot.  The optimizer I choose will get their named added to the author list, as an optimizer.  \r\n\r\nThanks, lemme know what ya'll think!"
