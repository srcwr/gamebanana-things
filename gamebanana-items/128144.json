(originaly the idea was to have 2 boats in an ocean that fire at eachother, but the physics didn't like this large boat so I gave up on that map and just quickly produced this, but its by far my worst work but good for a few laughs)\r\n\r\nMap made a while ago releasing now\r\nSet for up to 32 spawns\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here at Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect..\r\n"
