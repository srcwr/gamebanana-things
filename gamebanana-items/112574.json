	"_sText": "Yet another fy map for CS:S, both teams start on one side of a seperating wall. The wall can be scaled over by climbing ladders, or jumping on crates then into the brances of some trees. Also, the middle wooden door can be blown apart allowing crazy rushing tactics if properly organized!\r\n\r\nThe map supports up to 64 players in case of future modding. Players cannot access the entire valley way to prevent this map turning into an awp fest, and are limited to the door area of the gate, keeping the firefights fast and quick.\r\n\r\nThis map was made by Rookie and Privo."
