Original author is _Butterknife_, i just remade and fixed this map :)\r\n**Story**\r\n=========\r\nAfter huge update, what broke jurassicpark, i heard that Butterknife quit mapping and hes not going to fix it :( First i was very unhappy, cuz i rly liked jurassicpark and first i was trying to find a proper fixed version of it... but like you all might now, there aren't any good fixed versions.\r\nAfter some thinking, decided to fix it myself. First i decompiled the latest version of this map and i have to say it was so badly broken... leaks, overlapping textures, overlapping objects, wierd looking and stretched displacements etc. So, the only way was to completely remake this map. First i made some plans on paper, took some measurements and started mapping. It took me 8th versions to get this so far as it is :) (4beta versions + 4final versions) \r\nTesting took place in I3d zombie escape server (213.163.68.179:27015)\r\nI hope you all enjoy this map!! \r\n===============================\r\nIf you find any mistakes, bugs, then please tell me :)"
