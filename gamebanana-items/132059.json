	"_sText": "My Impossibru map. Something we came up with over at PlagueFest. To create a ZM map with the dimensions 1024x1024. (Of course this means the playable area. Skybox and pretty stuff are not bound by this.)\r\n\r\nIt's pretty, it's pink, and it's fucked up. I have absolutely no idea if this will ACTUALLY work. 64 spawns and a butt fuck of holdable positions. I expect LOTS of lag from this. (I hope not. D: )\r\n\r\nThis version is only a test. Once I get help with Propper (Grumble grumble) I will be doing the skybox, because right now I am hitting the limit for planes.\r\n\r\nPlease test and provide feedback. Thank you. :)"
