He disappeared and I took over. With what he left to me, I had to basically recreate everything except the ramps; Which I will give credit to him for.\r\n\r\n- Changes:\r\n- added ammo to all guns\r\n- added a block bullets brush at spawn to prevent spawn killing\r\n- added a wall to prevent people from taking a short cut to jail\r\nBasically, all in all this map had to be remade. There are way too many changes to list. You should download the map and test it out, I guarantee that you will be pleased.\r\n\r\n- Credits:\r\n- Original creator of surf_10x_final: Wof-\r\n- Assaulted Combat: who started this reload last year.\r\n---------------------\r\nFIX UPDATES:\r\n- Fixed the glass wall at spawn, players were able to shoot through it\r\n- Opened up the map so the main area is in one open skybox\r\n- Other small things\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n-- Buck Nasty\r\n\r\nhttp://solidsurf.info/\r\nhttp://www.bucknastysurf.ner/"
