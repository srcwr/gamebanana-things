Stop by my server @ 63.251.20.40:27015 to add your time to the list.\r\n\r\nAoki\r\n____\r\nBunnyhop map centered around monster jam and a lot of jokes that you may or may not understand.  Difficulty is easy/medium; can be done on stock settings.  Each bhop has a corresponding climb path, so this could be played on an climb server as well.  Map is 40 mb; 20/20 on map and custom content.  You may need to increase net_maxfilesize in your server.cfg to play this.\r\n\r\n\r\nmonster jam\r\n___________\r\nMONSTER JAM RULES AND SO DOES THIS MAP BY THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY OF JAMMING. ENJOY."
