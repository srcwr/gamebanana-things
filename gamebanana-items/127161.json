	"_sText": "So I felt like making another deathrun map. A few hours later, here is the results.\r\n\r\n20 Traps\r\n45 CT Spawns\r\n2 T Spawns\r\n\r\nAnd a fun little rocket launcher at the end of the map. It seems to glitch out every now and then (it will be facing the wrong direction), however it is still fully functional. Just looks weird.\r\n\r\nAny bugs/suggestions, feel free to post.\r\n\r\n*4th Version made just to balance some traps.\r\n\r\nMade for SteamGamers.com Deathrun server,\r\n66.150.121.71:27015"
