	"_sText": "Hello everyone, Im pleased to announce the release of bhop_megasphere! There's been alot of blood sweat and tears to get this into the state it is today, also figuring out how the hell to make a really good bhop map work in the Source engine, but Im pretty proud of how it looks and plays now. It should run well on most systems with a RTX 2080 TI / XFX Nvidia Geforce 8600GT&nbsp; or above, not sure about below that as I havent been able to test on lower end systems. ========= Thanks to everyone who offered feedback and advice on this map, its been a big challenge and a hard journey and I hope you have fun!<br><br>Map is playable on auto and scroll. Meant to be played 100aa."
