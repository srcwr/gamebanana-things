	"_sText": "This is one of my first maps. I made it because I wanted a map where people had to use cunning and the only way that would happen is if people couldn't see a damn thing. Pretty much all the map is pitch black beside the spawn (so you can see t get into the play area) and the bomb site, which causes a dilemma for the T's. Do they risk certain death to win the round or do they hang back and hope to kill all the enemies.\r\n\r\nAnyways this is an amazingly small map which could make it quite hectic in the dark.\r\n\r\nPO, y'all."
