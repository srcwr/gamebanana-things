What you do is knife/shoot the box a few times, then when it breaks, an mp5 spawns inside of it, creating the illusion that it was in it (performance issues = why i had it spawn)\r\nand im just change the mp5 model to another weapon, but most dont fit lawl\r\n-------------------------------\r\nidc if you credit me\r\n\r\nworks AWESOME in water.\r\n\r\n"
