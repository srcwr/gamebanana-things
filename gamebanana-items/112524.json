	"_sText": "My second map first attempt at an FY map. This map is completely symmetrical. Both teams have buy zones in case the weapons I put there are not to your liking. Spikes that come out of the ground (displacement tool) poke through all the way to the skybox, at top \"glass\" I like to call it. You can use those spikes for cover on the Level 3 (Top Glass) if needed. There are 2 awps in the map at L3 which located in the centerish of the map, to get it you might have to fight for it as I set up a row of AKs and M4s before the awp. \r\n\r\nWarehouse on each side has ever submachinegun inside, (MP5, UMP, Mac10 (Ts) P90 and TMP (CTs) The elevator has a button on the inside to send it up as well as a M3 and M10 shotgun inside, if you need to call it down again a button is provided at the top. The doors at ground zero are touch opens as well as use opens. \r\n\r\nHave fun! Please rate and comment! \r\n\r\n:: Links ::\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?yzmgjyyyqml\r\nhttp://www.megaupload.com/?d=FE55QO59"
