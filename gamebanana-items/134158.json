	"_sText": "NOTE: The authors listed above beside myself are the authors of the original maps. I did not collaborate with them in the creation of this map.\r\n\r\nHey. I took 3 favorite gg maps and smashed em into 1. The basic layout is funtimes. I threw a church from churches in, modified the entrances/exits in a way that retains the layout from funtimes. One side of the map is of the dev texture style, where I added one of the buildings from jungle, then flipped it to keep symmetry for the other side. Also added the palm tree from jungle and city. All in all, I think I like it, though I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet with anyone else.\r\n\r\nCredit for the original maps go to the respective authors. This is not all my work, I took 3 maps and combined them with some tweaks. I only take credit for the combination of the maps, and the tweakin. :P\r\n\r\nFeel free to use, host, distribute, decompile, edit, steal credit, flame or praise this map. The only thing I require if you host it or know any servers that host it is to send me the I.P. so I can play it! levisemail1337@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
