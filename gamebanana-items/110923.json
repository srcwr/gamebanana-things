	"_sText": "This map is a classic recreation of Nintendo's GoldenEye 64 map \"The Stack,\" which is the top half of The Library.  This map was made from scratch by me, Draven. The textures are from the GoldenEye: Source Team.\r\n\r\nThis is a classic map with 3 very minor differences:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>The doors open On Touch AND On Use.  In GoldenEye they only work on use, but due to people that can't figure out how to open a door, I put in the On Touch feature as well.\r\n\r\n<LI>The glass respawns after 45 seconds. it doesn't in GoldenEye.\r\n\r\n<LI>There was no jump in GoldenEye, so you couldn't \"fall\" off the edges. That has been removed so you can jump on to ramps and off of the top level.\r\n</OL>\r\nThis map is made for Gun Games and Fight Yards.  There are 32 spawn points, but no bomb zones or hostages.\r\n\r\n<font size=\"3\" color=\"red\"><B>**UPDATE**</B></font>\r\nI have updated this map to 1.1 with changes including:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>Buy zones now fixed and cover all spawn points\r\n<LI>Fixed some texture misalignment\r\n<LI>Reduced file size by 500kb\r\n</OL>\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this map. You can look forward to The Basement in the near future. The Library is located here: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/58331\r\n\r\n<font size=\"3\">Please leave an assessment!</font>"
