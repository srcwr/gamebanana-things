Tell me what you think!<br><br>de_storeage is based off of the unreleased de_dust3 from the <u><i>MASSIVE 60GB&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;Valve repo leak!</b></i></u><br>as you can tell from point A. But its turned into a port/storeage/crate emporium thing?<br>it also doesn't have any textures. Cause I'm lazy.<br><br>Why is it de_storeage and not de_storage?<br>so that it doesn't conflict with any other maps you goof!<br>pretty sure that there's already a map named de_storage.<br><br>Thanks, and have fun! (or don't)"
