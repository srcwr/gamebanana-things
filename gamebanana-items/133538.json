	"_sText": "This was my first attempt at a map using the Hammer Editor from Source SDK. I went for a gun game map because I always enjoyed playing on gun game servers. I did go ahead and add in buy zones in case anyone would like to use this map for anything else. I really do hope you enjoy this map. \r\n\r\nThe map itself is symmetrical. Terrorists occupy the orange and red houses while Counter-Terrorists occupy the purple and blue houses. There are 48 spawns on the map, 12 per house. Each team will spawn in the back room of their house giving them them the option of going down into the sewers or out into the courtyard. The bunker in the middle of the courtyard/sewer allows for a fast exit if needed."
