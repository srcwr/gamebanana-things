This is also my first time to use fpsbanana, so If I'm doing something wrong please inform me. I would like to thank the author of the Revox textures for making them publicly available as well as Katana Fox for his futuristic light prefab. If you enjoy this map, please take five seconds to say that you did. It means a lot to me, :] .\r\n\r\nEdit: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that this is shit hard, so experienced sliders only."
