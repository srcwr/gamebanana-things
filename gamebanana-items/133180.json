	"_sText": "Zm_zuluville_facility_acp_v1 is a small map that I have created.\r\nMy main goal is quite simpile with this map, this is campers must die!\r\nIts not called camping mod after all.\r\n\r\nThere are a few heavy camping spots but they have a few functions in which zombies can use in order to kill the campers.\r\nSome traps are just buttons on a timer and others you need to know a code to open doors etc.\r\nI also tryed to get rid of most of the corners as a lot of the time zombies can get trapped in this, what I did instead was add 90 degrees arches and what happends is the zombies deflect and end up getting boosted else where, worked well in testing.\r\n\r\nThe map I know has not a great amount of detail but I wanted all the walls and floor to be smooth and empty so they when the zombies get boosted there is little to get stuck on.\r\n\r\nI hope it can be a fun and at times funny map with good balance."
