	"_sText": "This is version of poorly-made map with a good idea - mg_awpknivez. Now I totally remade it without decompilation. Map idea is same - in the middle of the map is ring - place where Ts fight against CTs in a knife fight to the death. At each end of the map are elevated positions for leaders. \r\nLeaders have the AWP and shoot enemies in the ring. Death one of the team in the ring causes the death of leader and end of the round.\r\nThe leader of one team can also kill the second leader. Between them is only a wall with small holes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Contains:**\r\n<br>- a small pyramid on spawn, which selects leaders\r\n<br>- ring and 2 leadership position\r\n<br>- dividing wall with small holes\r\n<br>- HDR\r\n<br>- dev textures"
