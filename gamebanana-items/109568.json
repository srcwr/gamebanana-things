	"_sText": "A map where you start in some light but as you walk away from the spawn point, all off the ground floor gets really dark and i would really suggest you buy night vision or you get yourself a rifle and go to the 2nd floor and camp out. 2nd floor is lit up very much and has arches all over, it was kindof inspired by the old movie \"Tron\". elevator between 1st and 2nd floor, you have to climb a ladder or run across the 1st floor, up a ramp and over a bridge to get to it. a lot of fun if you're playing bots or friends, best played with a few people or a huge amount of people, both ways its tense and you can get the most from the map.\r\n\r\nif you'd like to request a map just add me on steam or shoot me a mail"
