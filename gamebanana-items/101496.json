	"_sText": "If you are looking for a large scale urban combat arena, then this is one of the better maps to do it on. The city's scale is immense, with blocks and blocks of buildings, cars and assorted debris. Even with all of this open area, there is also a few fully model interiors to make for some short cuts through the city. Once of these areas goes through a water treatment facility and up to one of the bomb sites, which is in a small auto garage. The map quality is great, and gives you that sense that you are fighting in an urban setting. The buildings, sidewalks, utilities and so forth are modeled with great detail. This map supports up to 64 players, and with that many players, not a single tile will go untrampled in the largest of battles.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: yellow; font-size: xx-Small\">Review by Milkman.</p>"
