	"_sText": "Fourth map in the \"pe dream\" series by Privo and/or Rookie.\r\n\r\nThis map is a very frantic combat-arena style floating platform high above the desert. Much of this map is interactive. The glass floors break, the tunnel-engines can be activate to cause powerful jetstreams to blow across the arena knocking players down to their deaths, the huge floating platforms above the arena can be damaged, causing them to come smashing down instantly killing any crushed by them, the liquid pools regenerate health but place you in a prone spot, the walls break apart after recieving enough damage, and the crates can be broken and hid in.\r\n\r\nLearning the functions of this map takes a bit of patientce, and it's important to keep an eye on your surroundings so you don't get crushed or fall to your death!\r\n\r\nMap supports up to 40+ players. A bot-navigation file is included, however, THIS MAP IS NOT BOT-COMPATIBLE. By not bot compatible I mean the bots will stand there stupidly because there is no objective or proper pathing.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this map, check out the other maps in the pe dream series, \"pe_tides_dream\", \"pe_metal_dream\", and \"pe_rust_dream\". More maps heading this way from the [PE] Dream krew soon."
