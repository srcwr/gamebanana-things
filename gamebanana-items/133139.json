The map combines multiple medium-sized maps contributed from some of the members into one large map. This was not released due to the exclusivity of our server. Since the community is no longer existent, I'm releasing it to the public to be played on other servers.\r\n\r\n**THE MAP REQUIRES SOME FORM OF NOBLOCK SO PEOPLE DON'T GET STUCK WHEN THEY ARE TELEPORTED**\r\n\r\nThis map includes:\r\n-A spawn room with a timer that will pick a random map if not chosen in a certain time\r\n-A total of 8 medium~small sized maps\r\n-Many secrets in each of the maps\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!!"
