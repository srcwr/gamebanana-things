It has mainly been made for fun purposes and to teach myself better use of Hammer and overall mapping.\r\n\r\ngg_urban\r\n---------\r\nThis is a simple gungame map, themed in an urban alley. Only, the inside of the buildings aren't as clean and safe as it might seem...\r\n \r\nThe map contains buyzones and 4 CT & 4 T spawnpoints. It can be started as a gungame map using the server.\r\nThe overall is finished, only this was my first attempt at creating a 3d skybox. This might not have worked out optimal :P \r\n\r\n"
