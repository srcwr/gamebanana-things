This version is mostly scenery changes, but I also added an underground lab area and extended the area around the house for you to play on, though it's still mostly field.  I also added 1 new secret, and made the house look more like the actual house.  I also added a TV antenna tower that they have at the back.  You can climb it as a ladder to get to the roof.  All old secrets stayed the same except the hard one under the deck.  I also re-did all the terrain around the house, so it looks sexy.\r\n\r\n*EDIT*\r\nThe map has now been up to _v2a with 5 minor bug fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions & Comments are appreciated.</font>\r\n\r\n"
