N for new\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple map! A small map, but funny to play, lot´s of hiding spots, including a great tower. if you have a sniper-rifle. A sewer system, or something like that. A hotel, a building a house, some cars. This map got it. Download it and rate it... however!! Remember that this is an improvement of my first map.\r\n\r\nIf you like it then put it up on your server, whatever... If you want to improve the map even more, please tell me first, or give me some creed!\r\n\r\nFiles: \r\n\r\n.BSP\r\n\r\n.NAV\r\n\r\nSome screenshots, .JPG\r\n\r\nDownload I say!"
