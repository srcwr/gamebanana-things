In one of them you can put the song \"Billy Talent - Fallen Leaves\" on! And in the other place you put the lasers on :) I got inspired from another map named: glass_trap_final\r\nOne of my favorite maps :)\r\n\r\nMap name: glass_cornix_beta2.bsp\r\nNap size: 12 245 kb :O Thanks to the music! But it's worth it ;)\r\n\r\n*NOTE* THIS IS A BETA VERSION! THIS MEANS THAT THE MAP IS NOT FULLY DONE YET AND CAN HAVE SOME BUGS IN IT! PLEASE REPORT ALL BUGS TO THIS EMAIL: Johandahl11@hotmail.com , thanks! :D "
