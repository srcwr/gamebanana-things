This remake contains a few significant design and visual changes compared to the original source, which were made due to change of game mode for maximum gameplay smoothness.<br><br>Story:<br>   Eight years after the hostage-taking incident a pair of police officers tried to break into the house on a seacoast owned by a retired mobster to get documentary evidence of his past criminal activities. However the owner of the estate has not lost its former grip and was on the alert! He tried to destroy his archive, then to go on the run. But after shooting both cops, he died of his own injuries...   Now to the house on a seacoast in a hurry two teams. Police special forces will try to capture the surviving remnants of incriminating documents. And the fighters of an organized criminal group will try to destroy potential evidence: a homeowner's private archive (den at the second floor) or a contents of the safe's wreckage (kitchen at the ground floor). Who will eventually win..?<br><br>Note: In <span class=\"SelectedElement\">design of this map used some custom assets created by Yanzl for CS:GO maps cs_cruise and de_resort.</span><br><br>P.S. ~ Curiosity is ill manners in another’s house :-)<br><br>"
