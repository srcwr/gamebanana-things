The terrorist has a M3, a Deagle, a knife, and a suit... And the terrorist ,for every player CT, has 170HP suplementary, and the CTs can buy weapons, and they have to begin $10.000...\r\n\r\nThis is an original concept which is a little as a zombie mod, but without the scripts ^^...\r\n\r\n/!\\ You must have Mani Admin Plugin for the commands (ma_give, and so on...)\r\n\r\nENJOY !\r\n\r\nPS : I'm sorry my english is not perfect... ^^"
