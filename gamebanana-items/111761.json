There are 2 entrances for the Ct's (the front doors and the roof) and the t's have 2 exits (the bathroom window, or the front doors). \r\n\r\nMind you this is not my greatest work, but it will do for now. Have fun and remember (like my father always tells me); looks are not everything, they need to have a great personality as well. Well believe me, this lil monster has a personality that will make your thirst for quicker rounds quenched.\r\n\r\n"
