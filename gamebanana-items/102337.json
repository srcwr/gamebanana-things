	"_sText": "This map is a defuse version of my previous map cs_complexo2, a \"favela\" map. I added normal maps to some textures and more detailing, and also an important lay-out change, an overpass crossing the map. Its quite a big map so its more fun to be played by many players. Deathmatch should be very fun. Nav file by Chizbone is included in the bsp.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your feedback."
