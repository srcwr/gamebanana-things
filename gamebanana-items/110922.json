	"_sText": "This map is a classic recreation of Nintendo's GoldenEye 64 map \"The Library,\" which is The Stack with The Basement doors open. This map was made from scratch by me, Draven. The textures are from the GoldenEye: Source Team.\r\n\r\nThis is a classic map with 3 very minor differences:\r\n\r\n1) The doors open On Touch AND On Use. In GoldenEye they only work on use, but due to people that can't figure out how to open a door, I put in the On Touch feature as well.\r\n\r\n2) The glass respawns after 45 seconds. it doesn't in GoldenEye\r\n\r\n3) There was no jump in GoldenEye, so you couldn't \"fall\" off the edges. Since you can jump in CS:S, that has not been included. You can jump on to ramps and off of the top level.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**\r\nIn the basement, near the T spawn point, there is a very dark hall and you can't see the door. This is in GoldenEye, it is NOT a lighting mistake.\r\n\r\nThis map is made for Gun Games and Fight Yards, BUT is best played on Death Match. There are 32 spawn points, but no bomb zones or hostages. Buy zones cover the entire basement and first floor (just because i hate dealing with them and will change in the final version)."
