	"_sText": "WARNING, SINCE THE LAST MAJOR COUNTERSTRIKE UPDATE, THIS MAP DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE (i don't think). It's probably due to the displacements, and I will slowly work on a fix.\r\n\r\nIt's Abstract. It's Lovely. Escapism.\r\n\r\nIt's a combat map, my favourite type, where the gameplay is focused towards one point, and then you are teleported to the start again. Vaguely like skyworld now i mention it. If you are good at surfing, however, there is no need for the teleporters. Also, there are various paths scattered around. The idea behind the jail is that its a nuisance that you can get around quickly, and you will know if someone is camping behind there. Something.\r\n\r\nTrying to get better the more i map. Responded to feedback from my last map. Thanks for komaokc for the lovely lovely skybox. Have fun, and have a video. :)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/46BEVEETSKI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
