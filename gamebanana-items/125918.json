	"_sText": "One german schnitzel and a french baguette decided to get into creating bhop maps with a collaboration and this is the result. The map contains 10 stages, the first three are made by&nbsp;Ã‡a Xploz, and the remaining 7 (shorter) stages are by Piu.xD. Theres also a small and easy kz bonus stage. The map is pretty easy (~ Tier 3) with an overall length of ~4 minutes for a good auto run. Scrolling took me about 15 minutes due to a lack of skill. <br><br>Big thanks to Saurkk for providing a test server and to the testers Saurkk, suNxprt, BludzeeLeChat and nyu. Also thanks to the wonderful people on the sourcejump discord for helping me fix the stupid mistakes i made.<br>"
