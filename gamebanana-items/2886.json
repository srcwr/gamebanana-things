	"_sText": "This is my first released prefab, I made this especially as a prefab.  The bsp inside the rar file is meant to show what the bridge could look like in a map; also the vmf only contains the bridge which is completely func_detailed.  Feel free to use it without crediting me (although I would greatly appreciate it if you did).  However you must ask permission to edit or rerelease this onto fpsbanana.  I don't mind if you edit the textures of the size of the bridge to fix your needs for your map, but any remakes of it aren't allowed without approval.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: You are giving feedback on the prefab here and not its showcase map. \r\nAll decent feedback is welcome.\r\nThank you!\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n\r\n"
