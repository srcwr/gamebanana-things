If you want people to be able to download the map directly from your server, you must use this command:\r\n\r\nnet_maxfilesize 52\r\n\r\nDefault 16mb. 4way_spacetunnel is 49.7mb.\r\n\r\nWithout this command changed to 52, people will not be able to download it and will get an error message like \"Map zm_4way_spacetunnel_idm_v2.bsp is missing\". \r\n\r\n----->If your server BZIPs the map you're ok.\r\n\r\nMap Information:\r\n\r\nFilesize: 49.7 mb \r\nSpawnpoints: 72 \r\nSpecial Features: 1 spaceships, no fall damage \r\nCustom Textures Used: yes\r\nCustom Sounds Used: yes\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nCopy the cstrike folder into your \"\".../steam/steamapps/username/counter-strike source/\" folder. Click yes to all and you're done.\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple of features:\r\n- No fall damage!\r\n- New elevators\r\n- New buildings.\r\n- Well balanced spots, not impossible for zombies though not too easy.\r\n- Totally retextured.! Lot's of custom textures used,\r\n- 72 (!) spawn points for big servers\r\n- Much bigger spawn area\r\n- Advanced Teleporters (make the map faster)\r\n- New elevator system instead of the old crane\r\n\r\n* And much much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS. I used the old screenshots from v1 ;)"
