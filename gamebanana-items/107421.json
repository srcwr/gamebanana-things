	"_sText": "This is my first map I've uploaded.  The main reason I made this is because I havn't seen any outdoor paintball maps that have anything that resembles inflatable bunkers.  This pissed me off so I maade a map.  I don't no too much a SDK yet so I will come back and improve it as I learn more(yes the textures suck)  I plan on making this map alot bigger to have a more realistic pb field feel and I will definetly add more scenery.  I made the map 20 player max wich is completly crazy but, why not."
