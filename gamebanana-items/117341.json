	"_sText": "This is my first map for cs:s, any bugs, errors or crapy stuff please tell me so i can fix it (or at least try to fix). Map construction took 6 hours, nav. creation and fine tuning took about 7 hours, total: 13 hours\r\n\r\nI have some problems when picking a name for my maps, so I guess you shouldn't take it's name to the literal side ok? The map is somewhat small, you basicly battle for your survival either outside the structure or inside of it. There are 28 player starts for each team, tested it and the bots didn't get stuck on the floor, the nav. isn't perfect, since it's my first try to make one manualy (going to fix it in the next version i hope), while entering the structure the bots may get stuck but eventualy whill enter it, while inside, the bots can survive prety darn whell. You won't see any bots walking on the sides of the map because they would only use the paths on the sides, and never entered the structure, so i limited them to the inside only.\r\n\r\nNo more words here i guess... download, play, rate, comment and remember, report any issues or ideas for me to improve the map.\r\n\r\njust one more thing, my maps will have EP in their name (EP = Elite ProtectOr, duh...) and i'm not english!!\r\n\r\nNOW GO KILL SOMEONE!!"
