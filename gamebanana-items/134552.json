	"_sText": "OK...\r\n\r\nThe point of this map is to be a face paced gg map.  The catwalks and tunnels were made to help get off of awp and scout levels.  To also try to limit the time it takes to complete the rounds, the walls move and cause damage, the boxes break, the windows break and the barrels in the center blow up leaving a wide open playing field.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first map I made and I hope it is worth your time.  Please provide feedback."
