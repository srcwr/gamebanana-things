There are still another ones in development.\r\n\r\nAbout this map..:\r\n\r\nIt is a little fight yard map. There are many ways to hide und running arround. But the special thing on this map is, that the map is really dark. Any tiles of the map are lighted, but not enough.\r\n\r\nI THINK, that this is a very cool map! Why? You can't see your enemies on the first time. It is REALLY funny to find them. :D\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers: 32 Spawns per Team\r\nLightning: Very dark\r\nDeveloper/ Mapper: M!ndbyte\r\nArming: Buyzones in every Team, no Weapons laying arround in map.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning! This map stands under the GNU/GPL license, which you can view at the GNU/GLP site for more information. whether when you want to edit, copy or anything other you want to edit to the map."
