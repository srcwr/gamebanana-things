Pretty much been working on this 6-8 hours a day constantly for the past month and a half. This was the most hellish process I've gone through making a map (pretty much almost everything kept going wrong) but I think it turned out well and by far is the best map I've produced to date.<br><br>If there are any issues with the map, feel free to contact me on discord: PrisonNightmare#7061"
