	"_sText": "This is the second version of ventex. It basically consists of a 5 story building with a ventilation systems that can be used to navigate inside of the building or to the garage next to it. It has about 14 or 15 baracade rooms and a couple hidden rooms.  I love this map so now and i hope you will too. Btw the room underneath the boxes had another exit you just have to shoot the red button to remove the van on top."
