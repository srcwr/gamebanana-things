But it didn't work correctly as jumps and/or different hights are not possible in IS.\r\nYou can try to fix this and get it to work or use it as GG map or whatever.\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility i thought of: make another trigger_push but not about 48units but 12 or something and let it push like 1500 up or something - so that you cant hit the ground (what makes you stop skating)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd like to see my name in the map if you can finish this ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXTURES ADDED"
