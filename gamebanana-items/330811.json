A rough approximation of it. <br><br><b>Warning!<br><br></b>Not everything is exactly as it was on GO, which is to be expected but still, some things may not look right.<br><br>Either because of a botched decompile (in which it has been through a couple) or just a misplaced object... Who knows? Who cares? If i didn't see it; i just pray that no one else does too. (kliks said that!)<br><br>Though if you have some suggestions, or things I've missed to warrant a comment, say it.<br><br>This is not really for competitive play, but if you want to you definitely can.<br><br>This is a vanity project to see what it would look like to use Half-Life and 1.6's assets and maps, then make it  like the new ones. (also because I have a subpar computer and just wanted to play casually with my friends on this map without any big frame dips)<br><br>Enjoy.<br><b></b>"
