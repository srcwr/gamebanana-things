And with a lot of snow ! YEAAAAAAAH !\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING, this is an *Alpha* release\r\n\r\nCompilation settings :\r\nBSP  = \"Normal\"\r\nVvis = \"Fast\"\r\nVrad = \"Fast\"\r\n\r\nStable release but some bugs still...\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n-Full 32 players support\r\n-minor optimisation\r\n-basic mesh navigation\r\n-NAV file included\r\n-bugs maps (please report, I've found some of them, but not all...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, help me in my work by feedback and commentaries,\r\nthe beta version will be a lot better :)"
