(I said official, because I had another that it was a kind of GunGame when I was fooling around with the Hammer Editor).\r\n\r\nOk, let's go talk about this particular map. I had used it in my clan server, and we found that there is no supremacy for one type of weapon to another, and is a kind of map that a camper doesn't have too much advantage.\r\n\r\nAbout the map:\r\n1- A night environment\r\n2- two spawn CT base\r\n3- two spawn T  base\r\n4- 6 hostages\r\n5- two rescue areas\r\n6- Total number of players: 24 (12x12)\r\n7- Map size: MEDIUM\r\n\r\n"
