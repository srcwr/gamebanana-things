Some ports are incomplete, meaning anything between 90-95% complete, and this WILL be updated overtime.<br>This pack contains (1-2) kz/bhop maps, and the rest are native bunnyhop maps. These maps were ported directly from Counter-Strike 1.6, and have not been modified, aside from some aspects of gameplay rendered useless, or not possible to complete.<br><br>Hope you enjoy.<br><br><b>MAPS-</b><br><br><b>bhop_cd - Map by CD, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/maps.php/4189/cd_bhop/\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/maps.php/4189/cd_bhop/</a></b><br><br><b>bhop_essy_jumps - Map by Whitey, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.95\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.95</a></b><br><br><b>bhop_viva_peron - Map by Paty, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.1459\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.1459</a></b><br><br><b>bhop_dustbhop_notkz - Map by ???, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/maps.php/2076/notkz_dustbhop/\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/maps.php/2076/notkz_dust...</a></b><br><br><b>bhop_leetbhop - Map by NAPZ, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.1396\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.1396</a></b><br><br><b>bhop_average_bhop_gbc - Map by Gorbachev, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.4076\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.4076</a></b><br><br><b>bhop_hop - Map by z1820,</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.318\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.318</b></a><br><br><b>kz_bhop_brickbhop - Map by mH, <a href=\"https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.172\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">https://cosy-climbing.net/user.php?id.172</a></b><br><br><b>KNOWN ISSUES/BUGS:</b><br><u><br>bhop_cd</u><br><br>-FPS drops/issues around later stages of map, unknown cause<br><br>-Buggy decompiling issues with MBSPC not translating skybox nodraw correctly<br><br><u>bhop_essy_jumps</u><br><br>-Random light at end, due to the way the original KZ timer for 1.6 worked the prefab for the end timer always contained a light, CBA to remove as it adds some semblence of ambience.<br><br><u>bhop_viva_peron</u><br><br>-Buggy/Shitty texture work, decided not to re-do it, maybe will update archive if I get around to it no guarantees.<br><br>-No music, I thought it was obnoxious and unnecessary.<br><br><u>bhop_leetbhop</u><br><br>-Some minor leaks on the brushwork, not entirely fixable due to the way the brushes decompile with MBSPC if I try it breaks the entire map completely, but the entire map should work absolutely fine. 100% playable with no bugs.<br><br><u>bhop_hop</u><br><br>-Possibly some leaks outside of the map, and buggy texture work at the end. No idea what causes either as the pointfile indicates something of nil value.
