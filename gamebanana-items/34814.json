It's a created from scratch and manually optimized .nav-file (because original author's .nav-file was not good playable).\r\n\r\nWell... bots use all possible ways now and for certain won't allow you to miss! Especially beware the dark corners of underground level :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/94335).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   xTc (for fine designed and high detailed industrial-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nLong Live Rock'n'Roll! :-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 20.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Added Place Names;\r\n- Some other minor changes.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
