The map features high quality custom textures and models, a beautiful soundscape, carefully crafted lighting, and of course a Lamborghini Reventon.\r\n\r\nThere is one bug. and I have spent an entire month trying to fix this. In the kitchen there is strange lighting glitches. I have searched all over the internet for a fix with no results. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PLEASE CONTACT ME AT clownbabydiode@gmail.com"
