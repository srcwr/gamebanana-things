Originally more, but lag would have been awful.  On the far left and right sides of the map you have \"balancing-beams\" which can be a shortcut to the main teleporters on the ground level, you will need to know how to preform a well placed jump though.  The ground level teleporters are team specific.  The final teleporters at the end are not team specific.  ALL water on this map can kill you if you remain in it to long.  Be sure no to fall when on the \"balancing beams\" =).  Enjoy this map, it is full of stradegy.\r\n\r\nSecrets:  There are a few secrets.  Have fun finding them.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Special Note**\r\nDo not edit/alter this map in any way shape or form.  Unless I have given you special permission.  Contact me on FpsBanana if you would like to discuss this matter. \r\n\r\n**Installation**\r\nDrag the \"Cstrike\" folder that came with this file into your \"counter-strike source\" folder.  If it asks for you to overwrite folders click \"Yes to all\"\r\n\r\nFor more help on installing maps go here:  http://www.cstrike-planet.com/faq/43"
