Hope my 15+ hours of work did not go to waist. I have worked hard on this and hope it shows.\r\n\r\nPlease give constructive feedback and test it out in-game.\r\n\r\nKnown bugs: None. (If you know any please contact me.)\r\n\r\nStory: In an abandoned factory after workers where taken hostage but saved by the counter terrorists the terrorists are going in for one last battle. The counter-terrorists must defend the factory at all cost. If lost the terrorists will use it as one of their secret hideouts.\r\n\r\nNote: I did not add HDR because of bugs that made it so I could not build the cubemaps.\r\nIncludes a custom nav file for place names and so you can test gameplay with bots.\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eHxRccnPlGI\"> </param> <embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/eHxRccnPlGI\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"> </embed> </object>"
