Just simple.\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\nBasically, The T's And CT's have to face off against eachother with knifes and skate around. There is a deagle in the middle of the map but it only has 7 bullets, use your shots wisely.\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\nCustom Textures By TDd\r\nSkybox By TDd\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\nPlease Rate and Assess."
