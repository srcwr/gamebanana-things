There is also a system of underground tunnels of which terrorists should get out outside as if to rats from holes. But if they escaped, it is necessary to occupy perimeter defense! :-)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It seems that the map author used textures from classic Counter-Strike, but it at all doesn't disturb hazardous and fascinating gameplay!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>About Playing with Bots: More or less playable NAV-file is included in archive.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Play and Test... also share with your impressions!"
