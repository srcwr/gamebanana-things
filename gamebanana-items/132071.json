	"_sText": "Strange map, inspired by another ZM map (name, I cannot remember). The beginning is just a sort of a dash to get to safety (player spawn in a building with no buyzones, 12 weapons placed at a distance, and a closing ceiling). They get to the end, and there is just a drop into a pit of.. strangers. Which is really just a transporter-hole. From there, the map becomes a bit less hurried, but far less \"usual\". \r\n\r\nThis is an odd map that will keep most players pretty much weaponless until halfway through, but it's all thought out (and there are buyzones, so don't fret). The last staging area of the map is a shrunk, modified version of my other map, zm_tarantism.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and if you add this or any other map to your server, please let me know (so I can play :) )."
