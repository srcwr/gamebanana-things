It could be a bit dark as its a beta i was going to make the next one less dark and most likely have better/more effects in.\r\nHope you like it. \r\nAlso there are some other things that I will need to fix in the next version. Like the sun is in the wrong place for the skybox.\r\n\r\nGood luck. Have fun. \r\n\r\nSorry about my graphics not being good on the video. I tryed not to make it lag to much.\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/37DqzqcAcGQ&rel=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/37DqzqcAcGQ&rel=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>"
