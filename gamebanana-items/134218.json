	"_sText": "This map runs very quick. It is very small. Although for it's size there are several different areas to go to which makes the map fun. There are buy zones at spawn so this map can be used for normal gameplay. I know the pictures don't look that great because the black makes it look dark, but you're always standing on either black, white or green so it really dosn't look bad once you get in game.\r\n\r\nWarning: there might be a problem with blockage at spawn because of how small the map is. Although with all the different directions you can go, I don't think there will be, but I can see a potential for this happening at spawn with this map."
