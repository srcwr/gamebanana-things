	"_sText": "De_roadhouse_dMw is a remake of the really old cs map <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/32\"><b class=orange>de_roadhouse</b></a>, which is an old favorite of ours. The main layout is the same but some areas have been changed completely. The textures are all new and most of them are custom. \r\n\r\nThe map is set in a roadhouse out in a desert close to nowhere. After an initial firefight the Counter Terrorists have fortified in the roadhouse. The terrorists have regrouped in the mountains and plan a second attack to cause havoc and destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no drivable car in this version of the map as there is in the old map. Because of this changes have been made to the tunnel to help the T approach to the fuel station. Displacement maps have been used to create a more realistic environment. The Doors Roadhouse Blues is still playing in the restaurant area.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the people at <a href=\"http://www.deadmen.co.uk\"><b class=orange>Dead Men Walking</b></a> for testing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't forget to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/53929\"><b class=orange>de_astute_dMw</b></a> and <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/54083\"><b class=orange>deagle_crypt_dMw_b3</b></a>."
