Take the flag and run to the upper platform, where we jump into the hole and win. If a player carrying the flag were killed, the flag returns to the original point. If a player is informed before the flag of the zone the whole enemy team dies, and carrying the flag gets three frags.\r\n\r\nUnder water, open the hatch where the barrel and a box. there is hidden Glock\r\n\r\np.s. sorry for my English :)"
