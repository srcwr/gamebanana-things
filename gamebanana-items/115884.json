	"_sText": "Ok. Me and my firend Colors where playing DeathRun for a few days ago and we thought it was pretty fun. So we created our own edit of DeathRun called ExplosiveRun\r\n\r\nOk im sure you wonder how you play it. here it is\r\n\r\nEveryone starts at the same spawn without any gun. NOT EVEN A KNIFE. They have to jump over explosive barrels that have a detonator that will detonate them in 20 sec. If they survive they will enter a few corridors. Each corridor sets in to flames every 3rd sec so you have to be fast. And its some breakable floors to that you can get traped in and burn to death.\r\nAfter the corridors you have to be first up to a wagon that contaions one and only one ak47. The guy who gets it will be able to shoot everybody else to death and if he dont the whole map will be set into flames in 20 sec and everyone will die.\r\n\r\nIt's really funny. I didnt thought that it was that fun untill i played it. I laghed all the time. Its perfect to play with your mates or have on your server.\r\n\r\nI think we are the first who does this kind of map so i've made my own category called explosive run = eprun\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to use NOBLOCK when your playing this. Otherwise you wont be able to take the lead when you at last. And if you dont use noblock you might be blocked and die.!!\r\n\r\nvisit our webpage at http://www.zfh.cs.nu"
