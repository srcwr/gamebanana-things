It was fun. And I had all these nice snow assets laying around doing nothing, so I figured I might as well stick them in a map.\r\n\r\nYou might point that this map has a rather large file size and is more fps-taxing than other fy maps. But at this point I'm not really concerned about that anymore. I don't think I'm going to be dethroning the fy maps that get played nowadays, so what's the harm in cranking up the graphics.\r\n\r\nPlus it's a fun little arena, with a touch more interesting-ness than your average fy_iceworld or fy_snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n<fieldset><font size=\"4\">Features</font></fieldset>\r\n<ul><li>Dozens of new models and textures\r\n<li>Snow and fog that changes direction with the wind.\r\n<li>All your regular amenities like overview radar, HDR, etc.\r\n<li>48 spawns\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>More by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/103053\">Dr. Spud</a></legend>\r\nTF2?
