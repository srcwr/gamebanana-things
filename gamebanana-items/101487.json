I <b>will</b> be texturing this sooner or later and it will look much better than it does after it is textured.\r\n\r\nAs you can notice there are many paths for each team to take. This is a very fun map to play with a lot of people and it can get a little monotonous with bots (mostly going A).I hope to also add displacements and maybe some models and sound effects as well.\r\n\r\nI made sure there were many areas with coverage and a few that are a bit more open for larger battles."
