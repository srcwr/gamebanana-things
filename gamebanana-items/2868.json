	"_sText": "ECHO'S SIMPLE BRIDGE\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple bridge created for one of my up-and-coming maps, ze_canal_escape. It's fully breakable, and each part breaks other parts. For instance, the four support beams on the bottom control the bridge. If any one of them are destroyed, the entire bridge collapses and breaks. In this way, HL2 physics are emulated into CS:S through the very simple technique of I/O triggers.\r\n\r\nIn any case, enjoy, and you make use it as you like on your maps. I don't need credit since this is easily done, but if you did indeed give some to me, that'd be great. ^_^\r\n\r\nComments, assessments, and stamps are always more than welcome.\r\nThanks for reading and again, enjoy!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nÂ£cho\r\nC.E.O. of Headcrab Hunter 2\r\n<a href==\"http://www.headcrabhunter.com/\">www.headcrabhunter.com</a>"
