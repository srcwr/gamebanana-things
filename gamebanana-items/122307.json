I have tried my best to make this as visually pleasing as possible, without making the surf unbearable. \r\n\r\nI hope the surf style in this pleases the surf community, and I did try to differ from my usual surf style, and make it a bit more advanced. \r\n\r\nMap does have a knife-jail in \"rebel-resistance\" style, where the \"prisoners\" can escape through a hatch in the middle every 30 seconds, unless the \"winner\" pushes the release button earlier.\r\n\r\nThere are MANY secrets through out the map, I won't spoil where they are, but don't bother trying to open blue doors. Yellow doors, MIGHT contain some hidden rooms ;)\r\n\r\nOther then that, I feel like this is my best map so far, and I really hope that you ( the community) like it as much as I do.\r\n\r\nVIDEO (OLD version)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aWakK9xRZnk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
