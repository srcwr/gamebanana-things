	"_sText": "<b class=\"green\">Notes:</b>\r\n\r\nJust a small aim map I made, mainly for myself. I was getting back into the good ol' style of cs, after playing zombie mod for awhile. Thought I'd make a nice snow map, since there weren't a lot made. \r\n\r\nCouldn't add very much displacements because it made it a lot more laggy. \r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Next Steps:</b>\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to make this into another version, with some added props, new weapons, and maybe expanding it a little bit. \r\n\r\n<b class=\"blue\">Extras:</b>\r\n\r\nAll the guns are fully loaded, and there's a scout in the middle. \r\nI'm also hoping to make it into a fy map. I'll add more weapons and such, but I think it could work as a fy map. \r\n\r\nRadar overview included into the bsp (no need for a small map like this, but always nice to have) I also edited the NAV a bit, the bots couldn't get on the terrorists side roof.
