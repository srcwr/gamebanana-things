	"_sText": "Spacey Map. Based on greatriver quite heavily. Made completely from Scratch (except for the notes at the bottom).\r\n\r\nThis map is quite difficult, and getting to the top requires quite a lot of speed. I've put a little secret place in, but to get there you need to use noclip. I thought it would be best that way. I'd love to see this map on a server.\r\n\r\nUrm, the skybox was made by lost, so , thanks lost!\r\n\r\nI don't know who the text was made by. I found it in the prefabs section. If you see this is yours, and want credit, just pm me, or even mention on the comments here.\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
