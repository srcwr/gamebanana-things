	"_sText": "Most information is included in the .zip. ^^\r\n\r\nThis map is quite popular on the BB 24/7 Surf server. I am an admin there, but most of the time I find myself mapping the hours away. This is my first surf map, my other map is fun_hobbes. I am working on a new map, surf_sniper, which includes HDR lighting.\r\n\r\nA comment I receive a lot about this map is how intuitive the jail system works! If anyone has ever played this map, it's very annoying trying to have to jump over the hills and valleys, constantly under fire by sniper bullets and AUGs. It's easy to just turn around and shoot into the sniper den, but its harder to get the jailtop campers! There are a few secrets scattered around the jail area, as well.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to work with surf maps after the success of completing fun_hobbes. Hopefully this accounts for it. I will release fun_hobbes and my most recent creation, surf_intheair, very soon. Hopefully I'll tag a few more screenshots in. Thank you so much for reviewing this and I hope you will put it on your server!\r\n~ hobbes312"
