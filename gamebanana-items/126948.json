	"_sText": "My first map.\r\n\r\nIt is a relatively basic deathrun map, nothing too fancy, run in a straight line etc etc.\r\n\r\nNo buttons can be spammed, but be warned they have a 20sec reset time, so don't wait around.\r\n\r\nIf the CTs complete the map, both they and the Ts are teleported to a jump room, where they have to race to a final teleporter. From here there are 3 choices. Have fun checking them out.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this map are 2 secrets at the end, nothing special, just something nice for the CTs.\r\n\r\nI understand there are some problems with this map, including bad FPS at times, and will eventually work on a v2 of it, but that is not my primary focus at the moment.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nV2 is almost complete:\r\nnew traps!\r\nno more walls to block ts!\r\nvolumetric lighting!\r\nhdr lighting!\r\nnew bonus areas!\r\nmore spawns!\r\ntrap fixes!\r\nmassive optimisation upgrades!\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\nNO MORE ORANGE TEXTURE."
