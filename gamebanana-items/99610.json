	"_sText": "CS_BeachAssault_EK is my first \"Proper\" custom map. I made it for my clan -=[EK]=- and they put it on the clan's server. The response was so amazing from it that I thought I might put it on the internet forople to download, and now Iâ€™m doing so. It is basically a map based off something like Omaha beach on D-Day. The Ts assault the CT bunker and try to plant a bomb and blow up the CT base. Very simple, but with few places to hide and CT height advantage, things can get very intense. It is great to play on a small 6 player sever and I bet it would be great on a larger server."
