At the end of this pre-levels are always 2 Buttons. A red one (for Ts) and a blue one (for CTs). If you have done one level you have to push one of the buttons.\r\nYou only can press buttons for your team.\r\n\r\nYou can leave every Level without completing it if you get to the thing at the beginning of every level and let you absorb of it.\r\n\r\nIf all 6 pre-levels are done your team will get a hole in the floor of the spawn. This will teleport you to the last level. It only teleports your team. Not the other one.\r\n\r\nIf this last level is done you will get into a jail where you can choose out of 6 traps. \r\n\r\nIf noone completes the map you will get into another jail where your team gets weapons: For every Level you and your mates have completet you will get better weapons. The Timer is set to 6 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a BONUS level.\r\nThe system of Bonus is like one of the pre-levels: If your team made bonus and 5 of the other pre-levels you can get to the last level.\r\nIf all pre-levels and bonus are done you will get AWP in normal-jail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there is one secret in the map which wont be explained by me :p\r\n______\r\n______\r\n\r\nI hope you understand what I wrote.\r\nHave fun and enjoy playing my new map.\r\n\r\nExither\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a vid made by SG | Sh0k! showing how to surf the map:\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Q1c2pVMw5vw&hl=de_DE&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Q1c2pVMw5vw&hl=de_DE&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>\r\n"
