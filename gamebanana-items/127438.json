It's my second map, though the first I finished.  I'm far from a good mapper, but I think the style works and I fixed up most of the graphical kinks, though a few minor ones still remain.  \r\n\r\nTesters: obnoxious/Jesus Christ, rad0n, Decoy\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nGHS BoonDock for the disco/rave lighting prefab on FPSBanana (http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1732)\r\n`Asux^ for mapping advice\r\n\r\nInspiration from:\r\n[X]trem [C]limbers Articole and Noobish (http://www.dailymotion.com/Articole)\r\nTerracid and EXpMiNi for their mapping work (http://www.dailymotion.com/terracid) (http://forum.miniprod.fr/)"
