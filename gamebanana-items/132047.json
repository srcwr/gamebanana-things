You start at a big hole, shoot the glass and u fall down (a long way), you fall into water, in a room with 5 teleports.\r\n\r\nEech teleport leads to a new room. Some rooms have additional teleports to other places or back to the \"freefall\". each room has enough spots, and all the spots are well balanced. I tested them on our own server (ZFC) with lots of people playing and none of the spots are impossible for zombies. Though none are too easy.\r\n\r\nThis map contains a couple of secrets and lots of teleports. I made the teleports so that it's almost impossible to get stuck in eachother.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the freefall is to \"shorten\" the time a zombie spawns. This means you have to move quick as a human.\r\nThe second idea of this freefall is so that you can flee as a human, from most spots you can jump or walk into another teleport to go to the spawn freefall again, in this way you can run away from zombies, and confuse them by going into another teleport. If this sounds a little vague, check this map out :)\r\n\r\nIt's not a perfect map I guess, it's my 3rd finished map. I like the lightning and the new ideas. My intension was to come up with some weird new ideas for a ZM map.\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
