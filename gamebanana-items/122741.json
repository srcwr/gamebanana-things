I've got something to say about this map to <b>prevent flaming.</b>\r\nFirstly: The map size is very large! You can NOT play this map without having fastdownload (bz2) activated. Why it is that large? Well I'm only 10 lights below the maximum. I know this, so I don't want to read it in the cons.\r\n\r\nSecondly: This map is dark. Yarly. I know it, you don't need to tell me. I WANT it like this. The darkness is NO POINT OF CRITISM if you rate this map, but the look overall is. Comments like \"this map is too dark for me\" are not wanted here, I'll also write this to the feedback instructions.\r\n\r\nThirdly: This map is created for 66 tick servers. I guess it will run on 100 tick servers fine aswell, but in the beta tests I noticed that under 33 tick some ramps are glitchy. Please do not flame about this!\r\n\r\nFourthly: You should not play this map in an RPG-similar mod, as in the jail you do not have anything more than a knife and a grenade all 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nAlso this is not a rebel resistance rip-off or whatever (w00t).\r\n*************************\r\n\r\n\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\nATTENTION\r\nIf you got lag on this map, please turn of your HDR.\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nThese three points are the reason for a late release. I want you to be fair.\r\n\r\nCredits go out to Pariah and Karatek√§fer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> I did only add two screenshots, because it's hard to take good ones here, as the ramps are the main event. Please watch the youtube video instead!</b>\r\n\r\n<object width=\"350\" height=\"310\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/E4XamigdTY4&hl=de&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/E4XamigdTY4&hl=de&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"350\" height=\"310\"></embed></object>\r\nHave fun with this new design.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/tuts/6762>Link to a tutorial for the surf_pox teleport effects.</a>"
