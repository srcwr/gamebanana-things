So the terrorist's\r\ncome with with the stupid idea that if they\r\nblow up the market the ct's wont be able to buy\r\nbreakfast and will leave town in search of some\r\nwere else to buy they breakfast. Anyway it's just\r\nhit 6am and the sun's coming up but it looks like\r\na storms brewing! So will the ct get they breakfast??\r\nOnly you can save your banana's and melon's!!! Go Go Go!!!\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------->\r\n\r\nThese are the 3rd and final version'S of my map.\r\n\r\n                   <[FIXES]>\r\n\r\n1.Fixed market sound looping and stuttering.\r\n\r\n2.Added a few new sounds\r\n\r\n3.Added crazy weather such as: Realistic thunder\r\nand lighterning aswell as ground rumble's and rain.\r\nAll the weather has it's own sounds which include's\r\nwind, thunder, rain and realistic rumble's.\r\n\r\n4.Added a few more props.\r\n\r\n5.Map is now at the break of dawn.\r\n\r\n6.Added realistic bomb site with a extra massive boom!\r\n\r\n7.Added a secret weapon and a extra 2 smoke nade's.\r\n\r\n8.Nav file's are now debugged and bots work great,\r\nnav is saved into the bsp file's using Pakrat.\r\n\r\n9.Fixed skybox being to close to some brush face's\r\nwhich was making some building's appear invisible.\r\n\r\n10.Made a m4a1 version for those people who like that gun\r\nmore than the ak47 but they is still 4 ak47's on the map :)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy my final version's, look out for my cbble reflect\r\nmap due for release very soon.
