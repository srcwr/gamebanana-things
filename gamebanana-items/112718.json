So I remixed it to fit the type of fast FY gameplay that I was working towards.\r\nP.S. It was a quick make, and is meant to be fun! If you can think of ways I can make it look nicer, tell me!\r\nP.S.S. find custom maps by myself and clan members at our server 4.79.145.222:27015 add us to your favorites :D"
