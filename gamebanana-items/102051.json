There a many new crates and ladders to help increase the GP. The 4 big changes are shown in the screenshots. 1:The area between CT spawn and middle\nnow have an extra wall and door. 2:One extra way to go from T Spawn to Bomb A, also makes camping behind the boxes harder.\n3:The two closed doors at T Spawn is now opened, its good now when the CT have 1 more way to go so they can camp in there.\n4:A roof and more props added that is good for camping, the roof has nothing to do with the camping of course :)\n\nBig thanks to Valve for making this beutiful map. Special thanks to enishi_20 and badboy for helping me test the map.\n\nThe Alliance Strike\nhttp://thealliancestrike.egame-star.com/home.html\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/The-alliance-Strike\n\nDom SmÃƒÂ¥ Bananerna\nhttp://dsbforum.ownbb.com/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/domsmobananerna\n\nThank you for downloading!
