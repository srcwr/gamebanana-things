I promise that I'm not just cranking out maps lol, I made over 40% of the map in 2016 then and decided to work on it after finishing bhop_molimentum. I have a lot of free time recently so I just said screw it and finished it.<br><br>Ruma means ugly in Finnish. I don't think the map looks completely atrocious but I didn't feel like changing the theme that I made back then.Â <br><br>Map is around 1:10 - 1:40"
