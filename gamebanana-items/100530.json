(tho there isnt much strategy with that many people - recommend 30 players total)\r\n\r\nno, there is no snow. \r\n\r\nI moved two of the hostages to the room adjacent \r\nto T spawn. I did this so T's have to move a little\r\nbit when they play. One of the criticism about the\r\noriginal thunder was that it was a little too T-sided\r\nI hope this helps out. \r\n\r\nThanks for playing!!"
