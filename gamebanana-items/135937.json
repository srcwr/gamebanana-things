	"_sText": "4th map. This map I decided to try something different by doing a night themed map. I tried to add as much lighting as I could without taking the night time element away from it all. There are a couple of brands I stuck in. As advertisement for our gaming community. We are still taking people on if your interested. And more importantly, we mix. :)\r\n\r\nSorry if you don't like the fog in the map. I did fade it as much as possible without removing the \" late night mist \" effect from it. As you get from water irl. \r\n\r\nEnjoy :) "
