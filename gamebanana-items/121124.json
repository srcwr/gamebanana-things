I just never finished the map.  I've always wanted to make a scoutzknivez map that was simple, but a hell of a lot of fun to play.\r\n\r\nYou start with a fully loaded scout and knife (obviously), and I also decided to add Kevlar since the map is pretty simplistic and straight forward, I figured for the \"noobie\" scoutzknivez player, it would be a great asset.\r\n\r\nI suggest not falling in the water.  :P  (If you do happen to be a dodo and fall in, there are 4 platforms around the bases of the towers that will allow you to get out.  One more thing, you will die if you choose to stay in the water.)\r\n\r\nAny problems/bugs/complaints/suggestions/comments:\r\n\r\nXfire: wowyourgaiy\r\nEmail:  Phantomoper3@comcast.net\r\n\r\nEnjoy guys."
