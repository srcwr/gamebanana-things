	"_sText": "Hey Guys, this is my new Gun Game Map \"gg_tunnel. The Location is a Traffic Tunnel. At the Tunnel Ends are Tank Trucks block the Ways. I have add Ambient Sounds for the Tunnel Fan and the Fires. The Map is verry smal, but I think the Map is good for Gun Game. I have put 32 Player Spawns. I have some custom Skins in my CSS, so the DHL Truck is not in the Pack. I have add a little 3D Skybox. The Player Spawn are diagonal to each other. Sry 4 my bad English ^^  Have Fun\r\n\r\nour skillor"
