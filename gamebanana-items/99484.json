That was pretty boring, so I spiced it up by making it dark, adding a second story, and adding breakable lights and fire doors. \r\n\r\nThis is the first map I have ever made, so have fun with it!\r\nBETA version though, a real release for me would probably have HDR and reflect maps, among other things. Please tell me if you find bugs! \r\n\r\nI used several prefabs from the prefab section, so here is credit to them\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/417\">Office Glass by RobinTM</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/345\">Psy's Ladder Pack</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/247\">SGT_kick_ur_ass Rotating Fan</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/495\">Wowzorz1leeroy's Sliding doors</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/404\">Chillinut's Working Barbecue</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a short video with no sound, but it is still cool\r\n<embed src=\"http://img532.imageshack.us/flvplayer.swf?f=Tcsaglanavitc2\" width=\"424\" height=\"284\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"/><br/>\r\n"
