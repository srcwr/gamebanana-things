After I have made a map with the name 35hp_dusty_city_brc and after it has ruined the beta test. I have started to study deeply mapping, my knowledge didn't suffice for creation of a good map. After any new opening for myself, I have solved: it is necessary to make the following version. So has appeared 35hp_dust_2011:<br>\r\n![http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/2827/18165686.png](http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/2827/18165686.png \"http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/2827/18165686.png\")<br>\r\nSince map creation 35hp_dust_2011 I have learned much, have understood. Also has tried to make all top-level, and here it... 35hp_dust_2012!\r\n![http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3739/22067249.png](http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3739/22067249.png \"http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3739/22067249.png\")"
