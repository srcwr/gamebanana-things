It's not based on anything real, i's just a fun map to play on with a few secrets.\r\nCT will start on the top of a building , they can only use 3 snipers the t must seeck cover and plant the bom, ok if the people that play ct are very good the t will have it harder but still, the t can buy snipers aswell so i think it is balanced a little.\r\n\r\nthanx to: fps banana for good tutorials\r\n              youtube for good tutorials\r\n              valve for making good games"
