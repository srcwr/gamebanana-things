	"_sText": "This is a map based on looking good and being balanced for game play. It's fully optimized for the OB engine (in light of my first version). It has a good selection of soundscapes, lighting effects and breakable walls/floors that give zombies a balanced playthrough with those who can make impossible to break barricades. There are several areas to hide, barricade, and camp, each with it's pro and con scenario. There is a power console which can be broken to darken the interior, which also causes several things within the map to disable and several other effects. \r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nThe map includes two secretes, A combination to the floodgates to flood the underground, and a secret room. The secret room cannot be used to survive, and can only be occupied by one person per round, for thirty seconds before they are teleported out (you have the option to choose your destination if you decide to leave before the thirty seconds are up)\r\n\r\n"
