I made this map, for my friends community [Undead.dk](http://undead.dk/ \"\")\r\nIt will be played on his WCS and RPG server.\r\n\r\nI was inspired of the normal [hoejhus9](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/68885 \"\") and [TopHATTwaffles](http://gamebanana.com/members/144386 \"\")[Hammer Tutorial #50](http://www.tophattwaffle.com/hammer-tutorial-50-d-perfectly-lining-up-3d-skyboxes/ \"\"), but made the map from scratch, and as you can see, it is very different from the normal [hoejhus9](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/68885 \"\")\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n------------------\r\n[RadioBob](http://gamebanana.com/members/929644 \"\") for his [Old House](http://dods.gamebanana.com/prefabs/4906 \"\") Prefab. It is used for the bomb target. (You need to go the bathroom at 1. floor, to plant the bomb)\r\n\r\nHave fun, please rate and tell me what you think :)\r\n=================="
