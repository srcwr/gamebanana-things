	"_sText": "This is my very first map!\r\n\r\nI actually think its pretty good for a first try. I was planning on making a v2, but  first I wanted to hear what you guys think.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple map: A dark maze, with some \"secrets\" inside. These are hidden within breakable walls. Even though there is no buy zones, and you only spawn with a deagle, you can find different weapons some places in the map. Just \"Follow the light\" ;)\r\n\r\nThe maze itself is not too compicated, but because of the lighting it is still a fun maze. it makes you feel like you are trapped inside. My original idea was making it all dark, so that you HAD to use your flashlight, but I figured it would be better only to have a few areas that way.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you guys think? I appreciate critiscism! "
