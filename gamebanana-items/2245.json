	"_sText": "This initially started off as me trying to disguise a bunker of some sort underground for something different and eventually turned into me making an underground lab. Don't ask. The prefab includes an env_explode and a button thing that looks like one of the TNT boxes to set it off as well as the breakable grass and the whole lab part, none of the surrounding area is grouped with it although you can add it if you like. You can't tell anything is there so if you want it really secret you can get rid of that button and just make it destroyable. Also if you would like to make inside walls so that you can see people outside ( Give a point to the underground lab ) Just press the texture application tool click the inside side and browse textures for invisible. Choose the invisible tool one ( It's purple ) And press apply, it should still look the same on the outside but on the inside you can see everything happening above. :) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Enjoy ! = D\r\n"
