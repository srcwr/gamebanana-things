I have purposely left out extra details and extra props on each section to allow for the end user to impose their own creativity on each part so that it fits each map better.<br><br>Oh, that and I was too stupid and lazy to think of any universally normal thing to find on piers, with the lone exception of light or benches.<br><br><dt>Additional info</dt><br>The original idea for this pack stemmed from <a href= \"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/The_jetty%2C_Margate%2C_Kent%2C_England%2C_ca._1897.jpg\">this image</a> from the <a href= \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier\">pier article entry on wikipedia</a>.<br><br>If you do decide to use this prefab in one of your maps, I'd like to be credited as appropriate and while not required, it'd be nice to told so I could see how people have used it.<br><br><center><h1>Need something else coastline related for your map?
