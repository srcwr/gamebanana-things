	"_sText": "A mini game map where you use a custom impact gun to launch your enemies off the platform. You right click to fire the gun. This map took a lot of testing to get it to work flawlessly so please don't steal the gun. Set up for 20 players 10v10. Thanks to Dr.Tran for lots of testing help, Toasty for testing also, and to Borixon for help. \r\nSkybox by G-Flow\r\nIf you like the map please rate and reply."
