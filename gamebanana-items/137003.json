	"_sText": "A Mario Kart 64 inspired map (Who could forget the blocks in battle mode?), with a couple of twists: Teleports at each spawn to four separate Knife Pens, both with an exit out of the pen to a respawn up back of the original spawn. Once a knife teleport has been used, it is deactivated in the beta, and one of the green blocks above the teleport will turn red. Underneath the map, there is a arena, lit up in red, only for players who dare to venture underneath. Knifing is recommended.\r\n\r\n.nav, all custom textures are included in the .bsp, courtesy of PakRat.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy, and have fun :)\r\n\r\n(Ps... there may be cake)"
