To Recall people just press the certain recall button.\r\n\r\nWAR\r\nNothing new to this. Cts are teleported on top of the cell block area and Ts to disco. Ts have 2 chances to go on the upper side of the level outside of the armory doors. WAR button can only be pressed with a CT.\r\n\r\nFind the secrets."
