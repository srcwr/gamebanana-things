Factory is set up like a maze of work areas with two doors each, you can be seen from everywhere.\r\n\r\nmedium sized area, warehouse, work areas, hallways and office\r\nBombsites in office and warehouse\r\nBot friendly, nav included in bsp.\r\nNo radar, ran out of patience, will have one in an update\r\n\r\nFirst map, fps good. Hope you enjoy it."
