	"_sText": "Yet again another uba map by pookis :D lol. It has a bridge with glass flooring in some places, but mostly just sloid metal. On the bridge, there is a bombsite (A, in the middle) and boxes for cover EVERYWHERE. Under the bridge, there is a big fall, and just incase u survive, a trigger that deals 5,000 damage :D ahha so watch out. On either side of the map, there are big concrete baracades to prevent spawn killing, and also provides good cover. Have fun! Also, check out my server at 69.9.42.158:27015. We are recruiting!"
