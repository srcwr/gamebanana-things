I like this map a lot and therefore decided to texture it for fun (and my own practise). Just thought why not share it in the process :)\r\n\r\n<b>Objective:</b>\r\nUse the objects and environment to beat your enemies in gunfights. Pure skill will save you from getting that one headshot you didn't deserve.\r\n\r\n<b>Notes:</b>\r\nHDR is included but possibly not optimal\r\nNav file is not included but might still come. <i>Autonav will suffice for this smaller map.</I>\r\nThanks and have fun if you download this :)\r\n\r\n</center>"
