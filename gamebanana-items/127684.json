But they are that great that they deserve to be on there.\r\n- I DID NOT MAKE THESE MAPS! I simply added them all together and tweaked it so that the map ran smoothly. Check the credits list! Awsome mappers in there.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\">Map Info</legend></font>\r\n\r\n- Fourteen Maps to Choose from.\r\n- 50 Player spawn points.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"4\">Map's</legend></font>\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">Spawn <3</b><br></legend></font>\r\nSpawn By: Sm0oth123\r\nA fantastic spawn layout made by Sm0oth123. This is better known from surf_XIV. One person will make it to the middle and choose the map for the rest of the players. If that player takes too long then it will auto-choose a map.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">Tv Towers Remix</b><br></legend></font>\r\nMap By: HappyVanMan\r\nIn this map the T's spawn on top of one TV tower, whilst the CT's spawn at the bottom of the opposite tower. Buy your guns, use the elevators and kill each other!

The map was set up for 1 v 1 fights, but unfortunatly noblock wins this one. Map is fun, make sure to get all your team pushing on the wall at the same time to counter balance the group inside the ring =]\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">Volleyball</b><br></legend></font>\r\nMap By: lolobubu\r\nIn this map you must shoot the ball with your glocks onto the other teams side.

Not much really to say. A nice little map made by Razer, which I had to edit a tiny bit.

Like musical chairs, but with rooms. Try and beat your fellow team mates and opposition by getting into the rooms before they do. 5 Stages, as the round progresses there becomes fewer doors to get into. Will you be the last one alive?\r\n</fieldset>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\nNOTE: PMs were sent to all active FPSB members with maps that are in this map, asking for permission to use them in here.
