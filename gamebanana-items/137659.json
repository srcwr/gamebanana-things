	"_sText": "Welcome to Pepperland!\r\n\r\nPepperland is a huge, cartoon styled race map delivering minutes of intense racing in an (hopefully) interesting environment. The map contains loads of custom content, mostly all the cartoon textures, but also a few models. It is also stuffed with shortcuts, speed boosts, ramps and a few secrets.\r\n\r\nOnce the fastest player finishes the map and reaches the goal, he gets to choose 1 out of 3 arenas for everyone to fight in.\r\n\r\nTrack summary/info:\r\n\r\n- 1 lap on a huge cartoon map\r\n\r\n- Contains lots of shortcuts, speed boosts and ramps.\r\n\r\n- Winner chooses arena to fight in\r\n\r\n- Supports up to 20 players\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"470\" height=\"265\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1sPxWhQex6U?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nNotes: This map is quite big and open, resulting in very much stuff being rendered at the same time. This might unfortunately affect your fps some, especially if you have an old/bad computer.\r\n\r\nLooking for a server to play these awesome Track maps on? :) The Metaleak community has one running pretty much 24/7.
