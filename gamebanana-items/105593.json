	"_sText": "Recommended: restrict flashes\r\n\r\nI wanted a wider audience to test this release so I'm releasing it here. This is a very fast playing aim_texture map that I built it for my clan's server for the sake of basic fast paced pubbing. It's Inspired by Mohax texture_city which we run 24/7. \r\n\r\nThis map is meant to for very quick rounds, where a player can engage an enemy within 5 seconds of starting, but with capacities to play conservatively using multiple vertical levels and cover. Map size is small and is meant for under 24 players.\r\n\r\n\r\nletter prefabs taken from $ol!d$n4k3 texture - letters\r\n \r\n\r\n* found a problem with player spawns, where players would spawn inside of each other - spaced spawns out and added 4 spawns to each team.\r\n\r\nmap has been subsequently retitled aim_ag_texture_v1_fix "
