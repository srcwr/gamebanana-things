Please place some comments, even if it is critical.\r\nNote that I have set the map to be an alpha, that's because it's my all first version of the map, but there are no issues in the map, though if you find any, please let me know. Thanks :)\r\n\r\nBtw; Why the name of the map is containing the word \"applepie\" is because my in-game name is \"Da Sacred Applepie\" it is not because there is pie in the map, I just want to let you know so that you won't get dissapointed when playing the map. Srry if I have dissapointed you allready :p"
