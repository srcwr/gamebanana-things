	"_sText": "This map is an improvement on another one of my maps that I made in the past, dm_texture_paintball. The changes were made due to small problems with the spawns and ladders in the map along with the addition of a few new obstacles. This map is meant to be fun, fast, and for close to mid-range encounters to keep the action intense.  The inclusion of the tower presents a spot that allows for a good position to watch the entire map though is a risky decision due to the openness of the path. \r\nHopefully everyone will enjoy this map and it is very appreciated to leave a comment or rating.\r\n\r\nThis map is made for deathmatch and gungame gametypes."
