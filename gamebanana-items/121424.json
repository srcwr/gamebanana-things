Im admitting it isnt as good as my first submission but its a good play as it is at the moment and only some textures dont match up tis why im not happy with it.\r\n\r\nBTW - both this release and my first have 3 awps 'hidden' on them :)\r\n\r\nHave fun.\r\nNOTE - Map is goot with or without low gravity.. I used about 300 and worked fine :)"
