For now, it is only available as a bomb/defuse map, but I shall try in future releases to improve the quality of the map and also the gameplay of the map.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n\t-->The rain sound will only play for the first round. I'm working on a fix for this however.\r\n\t-->Map has only been compiled in Fast VVIS becuase it's only a beta released at the moment and I can't leave \t   it compiling for thousands of hours.\r\n\t-->The .nav file isn't custom, so bots sometimes will camp in one spot and sometimes a terrorist will tend to \t   use a fence as a bouncy castle.\r\n\r\nIf you spot any other bugs/improvements, please comment and/or message me on Steam ( J4CK8 )\r\n\r\nI plan to possible make it darker if I can but I do not plan on compilign the map on Normal VVIS. If you think you can/will help with the compiling, PLEASE DO as my computer can take hours just to get VVIS to 3.\r\n\r\n.BSP and .NAV file to go into your CounterStrikeSource/Cstrike/maps folder."
