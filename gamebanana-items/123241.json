But after getting a wave of compliments in my clan's Vent server last night I decided to release v3.  Update includes-\r\n\r\nMore ramps\r\nMore light in shotgun arena\r\nFixed spawns (YAY)\r\n\r\nFor all of you who don't believe me (Irish Hooligan) made this map, take a look where it says Irish at the top ><\r\nEnjoy :D"
