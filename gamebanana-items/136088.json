	"_sText": "A rather small Gungame map which is made pretty fast. Its only tested for some few minutes so expect some bugs. I've allways wanted a forrest map with both trees and hills so this is my first shot at a nature map. I have been mapping before but a long time ago so again you could experience some bugs. ;P\r\n\r\nI hope you like the map! \r\n\r\nAnd please tell me if you would like some changes and improvements for the next version. Is the size too small for this map? How about lighting, should it be day or night?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-= !UPDATED TO V1! =-\r\nChanges since v0.9:\r\n* - Added support for up to 24 players on each team\r\n* - Made some more bushes, rocks and trees to get for more dense gameplay\r\n* - Fixed some minor bugs (Spawnpoints and vphysics @ skybox)"
