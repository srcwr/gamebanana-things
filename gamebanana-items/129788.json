	"_sText": "Fixed the doors that where too small and the spawns.\r\n\r\nHolds 30 people, 10 on CT and 20 on T. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 guns cells, 3 nade cells, one vent cell and several ways to rebel. Rebelling isn't too easy but not ridiculously hard either. A lot of the rebelling spots are somewhat hard to find and blend in well. \r\n\r\nThe map is made to look like a hospital. The west (I think) wing upper floor is just for show and doesn't actually go anywhere, same with the bottom part a little further in. \r\n\r\n!lr room is in the basement and has Gun Toss and S4S and a good place for knife fighting and whatnot. Also contains a pool that doesn't actually do much but looks pretty. Doesn't have soccer because: \r\n* I've never seen a hospital with a soccer court.\r\n* No one ever plays soccer in jail.\r\n\r\nReally only contains the necessary stuff that is actually used frequently."
