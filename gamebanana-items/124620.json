This version has disabled many gameplay spoiling shortcuts so players will actually have to use the given bhop pads. I hope that any server that already uploaded the original map bhop_canyon to the server would replace the map with this fixed version.</p><p>What's a better way to end a year than a new bhop map?</p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>bhop_canyon, a map I started working on somewhere around the start of 2015 looking for some ideas and themes for the map. Finally I decided that it's time to finish this project so I did. The map has some route variations and high velocity shortcuts leading to bigger time differences between autohop and scroll bhop, should be around 40-50 seconds &nbsp;long with a good autorun. Possible on all settings. Contains custom textures and soundscapes.</span><br></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>The map is quite straight forward, so fps drops on low-end PC's are possible. Also the big file size is due to HDR lighting.</span></p>"
