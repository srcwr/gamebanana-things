	"_sText": "Well this is my first map release and i hope you'll enjoy this map. the idea of this map is that both sides start at both ends on this \"ship\" and they begin without any weapons, the awps are positioned a bit from the spawnpoints just to make things interesting, i positioned that huge block in the middle of the map just to avoid spawnkilling and so that you could position yourself on top of that block. Also i'm gonna make doors to that block so that you can go inside(but i'm working on that so that will come with the next release).\r\nSo please tell me your opinion, both bad and good things about this map."
