	"_sText": "A update of my Third Instalment from my Aperture Science Experiment Series!!\r\n\r\nIn this universe, Aperture science simulates combats, in this case a Deathrun Experiment, in order to study the subjects.. Each trap is enclosed in different chambers, where anyone who attempts to escape will certainly die! So fight for your survival and win! Winners get cake at the end!\r\n\r\nWhy? You might ask, do Aperture Science goes through all of this trouble? The answer is simple, for the people who are still alive!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a deathrun map with 14 chambers, so itâ€™s about 21 traps total. The setting is inspired by Portal. It is supposed to be inside a building at all times; you start at the top and jump down through some tubes to the next chamber\r\n\r\nFeatures!\r\n-There is CAKE at the end of the level!\r\n-Up to 72 player capability, 2 Terrorist and 70 Counter-Terrorist\r\n-Many innovative Traps!\r\n-5 Different Minigames\r\n-Custom Textures!\r\n-Custom Models!\r\n-Extremely optimized!\r\n-No double pressing\r\n-Teleports\r\n-Explosions!\r\n-Lasers!\r\n-Bhop\r\n-Granades\r\n-Spawn AFKers will NOT get cake!\r\n-I can keep going, but I have to write more\r\n\r\nThis is the the 3rd stabel version (Patches and extensions will happen with time! So feedback from you is still important)\r\nPlease send your issues and improvements, any feedback is greatly encouraged!\r\n\r\nCHANGES\r\n-Improved looks to be more like portal's\r\n-Removed old minigame because it was too slow\r\n-Added deagle minigame to compensate\r\n-Added an extra test chamber at the beginning. Will you go for cake or the companion cube?\r\n-Added a barrier which doesnt allow Ts to rush to final area to camp. They must wait for someone to finish the last chamber first for T's to proceed\r\n-Less delay in traps, result in more accuarcy\r\n\r\n**Tip** Last chamber (before break) the trap is INSTANT, and T's cannot jump without dying so time your push wisely.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nWhen a button moves down, the event has started. Different traps have different delays, but as a general rule, the first traps have more of a delay, and the last traps are more instantly.\r\nIn the Waterfall chamber, there are two buttons, but only ONE can be pressed. Pressing one will disable the other button, and viceversa. This is intended, and its similar to the bhop chamber\r\n\r\nNOTE.- If you want to see the complete map with all of its possible endings you will need at least 2 people, as Ts need to be triggered to the mini game by a CT. The breakable window is breakable ONLY before the trap has been triggered so CTs are only allowed to keep running their intended way!\r\n\r\n**UPDATE NOTE**, go to console, type in \"sv_cheats 1\" (with out the quotation marks), then type in \"noclip\" You will be able to fly around and activate traps, to walk normally again simply type in \"Noclip\"in the consle\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Eugenio 'Motanum' Roman\r\nBugs, comments, suggestions to agent_2114@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nMore maps from me to come\r\n\r\nSponsored by ]Hell[ Servers www.hellclan.co.uk\r\n\r\nSee screenshots\r\n\r\nInstallation, just paste the all of the files in the ZIP on your maps folder for counter strike source\r\n\r\nDefault should be Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\Account_Name\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps"
