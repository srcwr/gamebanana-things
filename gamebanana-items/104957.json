Would love to play it on css.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Map Took me a lot of time to make it look nice and try to make it as much as the original one. Some things i changed about the map and something are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n//// Small list of Things you can still do ////\r\n\r\n* Walk and Camp on the crane \r\n* Aim under the hele platform \r\n* Get on top of the Smaller Building \r\n* Get on top of the shop sign \r\n* And More.....\r\n\r\n\r\nIts not 100% like the original But i think it looks nice and the game play is real cool. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Map is not 100% finished this is the first beta if u see errors or see something u want change just comment and let me know :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!! Rate And Comment! \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the ip to the server with the map on it 24/7 :)\r\n\r\n    216.6.235.14:27015\r\n\r\nconnect 216.6.235.14:27015"
