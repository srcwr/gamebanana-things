	"_sText": "mg_fy_messerschlucht_v1_00 is a map developed for minigame and fight yard servers. In this map you have to jump down and at the end to survive. If other players from the enemy team are also survived you have to make a knife fight until the last player has survived. Its very funny because its not sure that you come anyway to the floor. There are many obstrucktions where you can die. Have fun.\r\n\r\nCopyright by Gregor/Betrunkener/Eiskalter Ninja"
