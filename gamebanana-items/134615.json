Includes destructible forts for both sides, underwater tunnels, sniper spots and baracades of all sorts to keep your team well guarded.\r\n\r\nPerfect for short range weapons, long range weapons, knifing and hegrenades.\r\n\r\nThis map also has buy-zones for anyone who wishes to have this on any non-gungame server.\r\n\r\nAll textures created by myself.\r\n\r\nSkybox texture credit goes to Karatek√§fer, thank you so much, your sky textures are priceless. They really add a lot to my maps.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play this map on our gg server, please join us at:\r\n\r\n208.146.44.32:27015\r\n\r\nor visit us on the fourms:\r\n\r\nhttp://seattle-ducksoup.com/index.php\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n--Manqueef/Emeriastone"
