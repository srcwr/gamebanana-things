	"_sText": "I made this map to have kind of a Halo look.  Players can move through this map very smoothly.  Lots of ramps and ladders that flow from one another.  It has a 4 story free fall into water through a tunnel from the top to the bottom for a quick way down if you dont want to use the ladders.  I also implemented a toxic area on the top so players cant set up camp.  They can get a couple kills but will have to move on or die.  Extremely fun and built for great fps.  Map can also be used for other cs.s games other than just gg.  20 players max, and no nav file due to all the different levels."
