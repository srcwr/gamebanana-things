The map is close quarters and has fast combat situations.<br><br><u><span class=\"RedColor\">In this map</span></u><br><br>The map contains one bomb site which separates the CT'S and the T's. There is also some cover at the left and right hand side of the bomb site for each team. The map was made in under 1 hour which is very obvious with its cube like design, however the point of this map was to see how much thrill the player can feel with its close quarters combat.<br><br><u><span class=\"RedColor\">Screenshots</span></u><br><br>The one bomb site:<br><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521796174219575319/521797412336042024/Screenshot_2.png\" class=\"HoveredElement\"><br><br>Showcase of how small the map really is:<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521796174219575319/521797349907890187/Screenshot_1.png\"><br><br>Spawns:<br><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521796174219575319/521801453107675146/Screenshot_3.png\">Counter terrorist spawn is identical"
