	"_sText": "This was one of my most deticated maps. It takes place in Las Vegas, in the year 2050, after a nuclear war. This map was origally from one of my Mods. But our team disbanned, i was the only mapper, so i took my maps and converted them to CS:S. The airport is in two areas. One infront of the runway, and one out near the front. This is my first rleased version for CS:S. But not my final check back for more updates in the furture. Have Fun!"
