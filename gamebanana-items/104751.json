He contacted the original creator and Hakk1tus and I saw some potential in this map so we fixed and updated it a bit to be better. We kept the original layout pretty much the same, only 2 spots needed to be changed and more light added.\r\n\r\nWhat we did was:\r\n\r\n- fps fixes\r\n- clipping fixes\r\n- optimization fixes\r\n- other minor fixes\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise the map is basically the same. Fixed and edited with permission of original mapper, thanks to PaPaGaLoS.\r\n\r\nThis map has 64 spawns but its actually quite small. Recommended for servers up to 40 players."
