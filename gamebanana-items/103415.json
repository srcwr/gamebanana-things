	"_sText": "De_outlaws\r\nThis is a old west style map for CSS. It’s a defuse map with 2 bombsites, one at the train station and one at an old mine entrance. It’s similar to inferno in size. There are a fair bit of custom textures in the map and custom sounds as well. The nav was done by chizbone and is tweaked for efficient game play if someone wanted to play it with bots. The map is good for 40 players but I would recommend 24. It is HDR ready and has a radar overview as well. It should play fairly fast and tight, most the buildings are not enterable but the saloon and the sheriffs office are. Some features:\r\n\r\n-custom textures\r\n-custom sounds\r\n-HDR\r\n-cactus generating skybox\r\n-highly optimized with hint and portal brushes\r\n-custom models\r\n\r\nThanks to Pedroleum for the crop and scarecrow models. Thanks to Ranson for the trough and milk can props. Thanks to chizbone for doing the nav. Thanks to Valve.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
