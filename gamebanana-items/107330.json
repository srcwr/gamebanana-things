So it's possible that I'll make a new version of this.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\t\r\n- To all sites that host my map.\r\n- The best clan in the world, KORT!\r\n- God and my friends and family\r\n\r\nTips and Fun:\r\n\r\n1.  For best results turn your gamma \r\n     all the way up. To do this click \r\n     \"options\" \"video\" \"adjust brightness levels\"\r\n2.  Wanna have fun with the gravity?\r\n     Type (sv_gravity 100)in console\r\n     (you must have admin to do this \r\n     or create your own server)\r\n3.  The original idea was to make a \r\n     map where you would have to use \r\n     the flashlight to play... you don't \r\n     have to in the map, but it could \r\n     help in some areas.\r\n4.  Some objects are not bullet proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION: \r\n\r\nYou must extract both aim_flashlight.bsp, aim_flashlight.res and aim_flashlight.txt to:\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Valve\\Steam\\SteamApps\\<YOUR STEAM ACCOUNT>\\counter-strike source\\maps\r\n\r\nIf you are hosting this map on a server please make sure all three first are installed correctly.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
