	"_sText": "This is the Final version of Network.\r\nJail is completely revamped.\r\nThe scout area was revamped.\r\nA pro section was added (you have to find the 4 spots that break that glass in the end)\r\n\r\nThe jail is on a 20 second timer that lets you out, until someone finishes the map. When someone finishes the map, it sends everyone to jail, stopping the timer and holding the ones who didn't make it.\r\nTheir are 3 choices of what you can do with the prisoners.\r\nThe PRO section gives you 5 chances, for Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist. If there is 2 Cts and 1 T in pro, there is a better chance of the t winning since the 5 fall limit stands for each team.\r\n\r\nThe rest is for you to find out. Enjoy\r\n-Ryan"
