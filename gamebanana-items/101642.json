	"_sText": "150 windows, 3 buildings, one bomb site right in the middle. Most T's start outside under the tarp, with rifles and some scouts, but they get a few counter-snipers in the buildings. Most CTs start in the buildings with scouts and paras, but they get a few who start between the buildings with subs for the ground assault. All this, mixed with a thoroughly thought-out building layout and plenty of Cover, makes pure mayhem. Note: yes, there are buyzones, but only around the ammo crates in the middle. \r\nThis is the beta 4 release. It has been playtested in all stages and this is by far the most balanced and fun. I could use some more testing and feedback; this is most likely the final version. Comments to beavatron@hotmail.com"
