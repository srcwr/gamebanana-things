	"_sText": "After testing this map on other servers, I noticed that the trigger_push entities are more powerful and overshoot where you're supposed to go. On a 33 tick rate server it runs fine. I'm gonna redo this map without the trigger_push entities.\r\n\r\nIt is still playable on 66/100 tic servers. It just kinda sucks when you get launched past where your supposed to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA remake from another map I released 6 months ago, surf_towers. Added a small surf area, new spawn, new textures, new light, and a lot of other small stuff. \r\n\r\nThis is a freestyle surf map witch is compact so you can battle it out anywhere in the map. Instead of a jail, you get teleported to an open area where you are vulnerable to attack. Lots of areas to snipe from means more combat, enjoy!"
