Now I had the time and motivation to fix all the bugs I've noticed and give it a better look.<br>The theme was based on the catholic-related beliefs of what happens in the afterlife. I am no Catholic myself, but have known the main \"afterlife\" background since I was young, and then decided to make a visual representation of it.<br><br><hr>The player will have three options to choose:<br><ul><li><b>Heaven </b>(most of the map is directed upwards, with boosts that push the player up)\t</li><li><b>Hell </b>(classic surf, with lots of obstacles and one horizontal ramp in the end)</li><li><b>Purgatory</b> (small but tedious and repetitive as it should be)</li></ul><hr>Purgatory's ending/jail is by far the coolest one, as it's set up in a maze with inumerous traps, that can be triggered (or not) by the player who finished the level first.  <br><br>"
