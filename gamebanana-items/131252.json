	"_sText": "I have been a huge fan of STALKER since I first found it and I would like to release this map since the game is about to come out.\r\n\r\nBased on actual buildings from the former USSR this map is very realistic. No more soda machines and couches, this map uses new props that should improve and enhance ZM.\r\n\r\nThe music included can be used to replace the current ZM theme. Since this map is released in tribute to STALKER and based off it, the site theme for the STALKER website should suit the map very good.\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\n+ At least a 20 FPS increase in most spots.\r\n+ Numerous new spots.\r\n+ Various bugs and exploits.\r\n+ Grass sprites!\r\n+ New buildings\r\n+ New spots and fixed ones\r\n+ Working grass texture\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
