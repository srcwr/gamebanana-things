	"_sText": "A Skiing map where you have fun going down the hill and can collect your weapons to kill the enemies. Bomb site at the interior pool at the bottom, and chair lift teleports back up to the top. Get air skiing by surfing sideways then quickly turning off of the slope. Lots of fun. (if you cant see your crosshair make it translucent)\r\n\r\n**This is just an alternate version with a different assortment of structures that make for different gameplay at the bottom. Has some different weapon set ups and anti spawn shooting ect. Just another version I made a while ago finally decided to upload enjoy.**\r\n\r\nPlaying tips: To avoid getting stuck on the ramp get air periodically by jumping or surfing away from the slope and you will never get randomly stopped. Also pistols are more accurate mid air/surfing than primary guns since the updates.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here, message me or find me in game Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918 Please leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on similar idea."
