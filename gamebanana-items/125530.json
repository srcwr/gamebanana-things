	"_sText": "This bhop map has a working spectrum analyzer in the middle of the map.  It took 15 mb of entity IO and ended up being 4092% entdata.  The filesize is ~70 mb for the bsp and ~32 mb bz2 (sorry).  Make sure \"r_3dsky 1\" is set in console.  The map See credits.txt for song info and other credits.\r\n\r\nI coded the equalizer in MATLAB as a fun project and decided to dedicate the map to Hatsune Miku.  The equalizer and songs can de-sync sometimes; I'm not entirely sure of the reason.  All vocals in the songs were generated by a vocaloid program.  Hopefully this map will extend Miku's reach in the US and Europe (a little).\r\n\r\nThe map was made for stock configuration gameplay, so don't bother saying that it is too easy if you finish on sv_airaccelerate 100.  There are 4 songs; each play 3 times before a round restart is triggered (~ 1 hour).\r\n\r\n<object width=\"300\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/r7FiLEiG30M&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/r7FiLEiG30M&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"300\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nSong list:\r\nNayuta feat.
