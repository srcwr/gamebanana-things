	"_sText": "This map is based on the game musical chairs. instead, i made it work with rooms. Everyone starts with a knife in a pretty small area. while you are knifing you will hear some music and when it stops some doors will open (the first round all will open as there are only 20 and when there are more in the map many will die anyway). only 1 player should be able to get in a room (thats why i have b1a as in b1 this was bugged so still more were able to get in).\r\n\r\n<b><u>There are 2 versions of this map!</u></b>\r\nBoth in this package\r\n\r\n<b>A version with knifes</b>\r\nThis version has only 5 rounds and everyone spawns with a knife. this version is best for large servers as the no knife version lets too many people die in the first round.\r\nround 1 opens 20 doors\r\nround 2 opens 14 doors\r\nround 3 opens 8 doors\r\nround 4 opens 4 doors\r\nround 5 opens 1 door\r\nThe doors that open are random\r\nAverage round is about 130 seconds\r\n\r\n<b>A version without knifes</b>\r\nThis version has 10 rounds where the rounds are this way:\r\nround 1 - 20 doors\r\nround 2 - 16 doors\r\nround 3 - 13 doors\r\nround 4 - 10 doors\r\nround 5 - 8 doors\r\nround 6 - 6 doors\r\nround 7 - 4 doors\r\nround 8 - 3 doors\r\nround 9 - 2 doors\r\nround 10 - 1 door\r\nThis version is best played with about 24 players. as there will be many deaths in the first round with more players and no deaths when less then 20 and with only 10 players there are 3 rounds without deaths. Also, the later rounds are shorter to prevent people waiting too long. Average round is about 200 seconds\r\n\r\nNote: people that have downloading sounds to off can still hear the doors open so they shouldnt get a problem."
