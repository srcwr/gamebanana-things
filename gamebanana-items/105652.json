	"_sText": "The reason it's called housesave is because of the CTs trying to save the little store, even though I named it as a house.The Terrorists are trying to bomb the store and so on.This is my best map and I'm surprised at how much time I spent into it.I know the house says AIM, but it's a bomb map.Small mistake! Sorry.Although, it is mostly for combat since it's quite hard to get into the building without being seen."
