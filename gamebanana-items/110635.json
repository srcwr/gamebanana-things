(I will edit this and re-upload when the problem gets fixed)\r\n\r\nThere are 2 versions in the file. The first is a simplistic level - note that you may fall off the map here =P, its not an accident, i purposely left it like that for fun. It can hold a max of 28 players. The second is a HUGE map, bigger than bridges :0 (or so i believe). It is made of 2 levels, and wide open areas. This one can hold up to 32 players.\r\n"
