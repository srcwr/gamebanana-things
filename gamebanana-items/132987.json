Someone asked for a map that focused on being like the underground part of the map zm_lila_panic.\r\n\r\nThis map features many unique rooms to test your barricading skills and using the barricade against the zombies.\r\n\r\nTheres the storage rooms (Terrorist Spawn), the interrogation room, the conference room, the garage, the box storage room(works like the map breakfloor), and there is an outside area.\r\n\r\nThis map has been play-tested for at least a month.\r\n\r\ncomments or suggestions are welcome."
