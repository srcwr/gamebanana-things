	"_sText": "This map is based upon the Team Fortress 2 Map \"ctf_2fort\". It was made specifically for gun game servers, as it uses dev textures on the most part, although there are buyzones built in. The nav file has been slightly editted for bot information and areas marked out.\r\n\r\nIt has an available 40 spawn points, each team having 20, and this being spit up between the 2 spawn points each team has, 12 one side, and 8 the other.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this map :D\r\n\r\nKnown bugs: Bots are idiots, that about it, and some bits of the sewers are glitchy what with the water, but hey, this is my second ever map :D"
