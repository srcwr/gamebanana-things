The teleports are not random, but go to each room as if you were walking through a door. In the rooms surounding the center, there are arrows for cover and direction. In the middle is a small room inside the room.\r\nHave fun finding the secret...\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you wish to alter this map in any way.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n-Me"
