Do what ever you wish with it. :)\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE: The Glass is not breakable.</b>\r\n\r\nStep 1: I made the .vmf into a .rar file. So, just place the .rar file in the folder 'sourcesdk_content' (F:\\Valve\\Steam\\SteamApps\\UserName\\sourcesdk_content)\r\nstep 2: Just extract the file and it will go automaticly to the 'mapsrc' folder (F:\\Valve\\Steam\\SteamApps\\UserName\\sourcesdk_content\\cstrike\\mapsrc)\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)"
