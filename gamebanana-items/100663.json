	"_sText": "The year is 2061, the setting is at the state of the art office. Look around you; as you can see there are no computers, everyone is more mobilized with their padtops, wristtops, and braintops, so all this office needs is somewhere to sit. Of course, most of the complex is underground, but as per the new rule imposed in 2031, the elevators are shut down at the end of the day, leaving only a small part available for those who prefer to work late.\r\n\r\nA cult has taken over-timers hostage for use of their ceremonial sacrifices, for a prophecy that has told them that they'd achieve super powers if they would; this prophecy also foretold that a group of dedicated warriors would have to battle a group of 'men in blue' during the rite that occurs before the moon is at the right place. After the rite is complete, these warriors will be the first to get the gift.\r\n\r\nCrazed fanatics? Probably, but at least they've settled in the nicest place they could find, with the prettiest carpet, and most gorgeous lights.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything on the interior has special new textures, some even glow, others not so much, but at least it looks smooth, and it doesn't have any snow."
