Map has already cubemaps and HDR, big part of brushes was converted to func_details... Map is using my own model of vending machine.. it should be packed in, but I'm not sure.. also map was supposed to be ZM map.. with one half on surface and one half in underground vault.. ehm.. cliffs are stolen from militia.. that's one of the reasons why am I starting over and quiting this project."
