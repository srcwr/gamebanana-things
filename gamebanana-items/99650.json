Some of the key changes besides obvious polishing and detailing include:\r\n\r\n-The doors are wider and thats pretty much fixed any problems the bots were having.\r\n-Added the 2nd route for the cts to take when they spawn.\r\n-The gap between the stairway is wider so you can now jump down it.\r\n-Changed shape of corridor on the top floor so its less of a sniper trap\r\n-Added more sounds.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Main changes:\r\nReplaced some dynamic props that could have blocked doorways\r\nFixed the low fps in places\r\nAdded more respawns (there are now 42)\r\nUsual tweaks here and there\""
