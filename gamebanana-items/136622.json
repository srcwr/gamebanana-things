	"_sText": "gg_Skies is a different take on the gungame mode. It is set on a platform in the middle of lake, surrounded by mountains. The gameplay is centered around 3 pathways each littered with cover. The pathways lead to 3 altitudes, giving several dimensions to the combat. The need to constantly watch your back makes this map fun to play and anyone will be able to jump right into it.\r\n\r\nThe map supports up to 64 players."
