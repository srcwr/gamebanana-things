It seems bots really use all possible walkable ways now.\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nWell... Play and Enjoy! :-)\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by Man Nay available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/177454).\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   l’Inconnu (for one of the most beautiful maps for CS:S),\r\n   Man Nay (for map optimization and playable initial NAV).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nIn Maps We Trust! :D"
