	"_sText": "Fun little map I made in a few days, color themed setting in space for a change. :^) Avoided flat gameplay as much as I could and went for a different style this time around.&nbsp;<br><br>Nofail map, No checkpoints. Good run 1:07~&nbsp; Also has a short bonus which is essentially just bhop_docks without the godawful ending.<br><br>Hope y'all enjoy. Big thanks to dream for testing for me, and providing the video. Feel free to sub to him for future impressive uploads.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7FRBQNa78s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
