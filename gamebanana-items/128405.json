I did my best mapping two happy weeks straight to get this done. With the amazing help of MG mapper <b>Tomgreen.</b> He gave me this idea and made systems like the great and innovating weapon reset system, the surprising cats, the G man appearing in the chimney and the radio. The last days were pretty rough, we experienced a lot of issues with getting the modelindex of the rat to work but we made it through. Many (little) additions were the idea of Tomgreen and I'm very happy we both talked so much about this we became great mapping friends. Thanks a lot and I'm looking forward for another few collaborations in the future!\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">A sincere thank you goes to these lovely people:</b><br></font></legend>\r\n<font size=\"3\"><ul><li><b>Tomgreen</b> - Level idea + Making the systems</li>\r\n<li><b>zaCade</b> - Offering great help in the end + Coming up with the (never used before) ragdoll kill system.\r\n</li></ul></font></fieldset>\r\n\r\nI'm so happy this map could be released the day before Christmas, have a gregarious time playing it. <b>Enjoy the warm great christmas time with your beloved family and friends and have a nice time.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>ProfessorOak</b><br><br>\r\n<i>Add me on <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993996601/\">Steam</a>!<br>\r\nWrite something on my <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/553201\">Gamebananaprofile</a></i>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vXal2AoU2Ek\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">Changelog</b><br></font></legend>\r\n- Version 1: <b>mg_OAKS_rathouse_xmas_b2</b> included a glitch, rat models were not correctly loaded on first map load. They only seemed to work on server's second map load. That (major) bug is now fixed in the <b>final mg_OAKS_rathouse_xmas</b> version. You might wanna redownload the map (:<br><br>- Also a few people asked me about the goal of the map, it's a mix of hide 'n seek and deathmatch! One team have knives, others have guns, check the screenshots!\r\n</fieldset>"
