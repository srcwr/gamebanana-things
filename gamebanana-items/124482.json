	"_sText": "This map is a bhop_orbital, bhop_celestial and bhop_dimensional merged together (in that order, zone orbital as the start and dimensional as the end). Only has a couple of cps because I wanted to keep the linear feeling of the maps and I personally find them easy to run anyway, I know there won't be a lot of players that want to run this, but I'm publishing it anyway because I think a one shot run would look cool (if you do get a nice run pls show me ty xx)<br><br>Some parts of Celestial/Dimensional have been removed/changed to suit the high-speed gameplay (you dont lose your speed between the 3 maps)Â <br><br>Be sure to play with a maxvelocity of at least 5k."
