Basically, one team is chosen to defend the a tower, while the other team is trying to attack it. The team defending the tower has a scout and 100hp. The team attacking the tower has a choice of 200hp or a USP.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 minute, an afk killer will activate and after 3 minutes the team defending the tower will be allowed to leave the tower. \r\n\r\nThere are about 10 guns scattered around the map on different buildings (all pistols and 1 AWP). And many smoke grenades all over the place.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid on how the gameplay will be, but if the teams are too uneven, then I will simply make a v2."
