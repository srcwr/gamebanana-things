I am still working on it.\r\nI uploaded this polished version of my beta cause I felt it was good enough for now to get a bit of criticism and then see what other people thought before continuing a bit further. The soundscapes don't end at the end or start 'cause I forgot to insert a 'null' sound in the spawn room or another song at the end (which is a black room anyway).\r\n\r\nI'd say it's about a easy-medium/medium map I dunno really though...\r\n\r\nAlthough tested on autohop, it was originally meant for normalhop/legithop. Hopefully I didn't screw up at all.\r\n\r\nNot sure whether I got that many people in the testing section there's probably more I forgot about T.T\r\n\r\n(P.S. I run a gmod bhop server and some of my friends tested it that way, gmod is sorta like ezhop.)"
