Comfort was originally designed to look like Super Hot and/or Mirrors Edge. This map has taught me a lot about mapping, although keeping motivated to finish it was a struggle. I'd like to thank everyone that helped me out in the creation of this map, this map would be terrible without you guys.<br><br>Average No Fail Run: 3 Minutes and 30 Seconds<br>Difficulty: Mediumish<br><br>REPLACED Trailer:&nbsp;<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpimOrZbI7U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
