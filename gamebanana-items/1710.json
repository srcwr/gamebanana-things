Reduced from 6 to 4 digits. \r\n\r\nPassword is 1-5-3-7. can be changed and edited very simply, just look at the keypad.\r\n\r\nCan have up to 9 numbers (but then it doesn't work). Very simple, very basic, does not provide duplicate numbers and does not make you restart if you press the right number twice.\r\n\r\nMade in about 10 secs XD\r\n\r\nYou don't have to give me credit for it, but it would be most welcome if you did so.
