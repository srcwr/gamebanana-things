VERSION 2.0 WILL BE UP LOADED SHORTLY. . .\r\n\r\nfy_Ice World - Redux Read Me\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n 1.Whats in the .zip file?\r\n 2.Installation\r\n 3.Description\r\n 4.Notes/errors\r\n 5.Author and acknowledgments\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n1.Whats is the .zip file\r\n\r\n 1x ReadMe.txt\r\n 1x IceWorld_redux.bsp map file\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n2.Installation:\r\n  \r\n      Just place or extract the cstrike folder into your Counter-Strike: Source directory. For    example place the files in these directories: \"C:\\Program Files/Steam/steamapps/\"your user    name\"/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps/.../models/...materials/\" The \"...'s\" being each sub folder inside the the main folder tiled \"cstrike.\"\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n3.Description:\r\n\r\n    I spent around, um...I don't know, like 5-6 hours making I think. Its a remix of the classic and SOURCE map called Iceworld. I just wanted to make it a little bit more interesting. I started out not wanting to add so much to it because I wanted to retain the original look but in a more SOURCE kinda way. I started by just making the basic layout but ended up with a hell of a lot more stuff. So, it basically turned in to a rocket silo with four(4) rockets in the middle acting as the original four(4) snowy square pillars that where centered in the middle of the original map Iceworld. The map is square like the previous one expect I added some buildings, a watch tower, a loading dock, the missile silos(obviously)and then I added a lower office level(which is only for appearances and is not enter able.) The lighting is way off, not intolerable but, its just a lot dimmer then I would of like it to have been. Unfortunately, the SDK crashed suddenly on me and the map won't load...at all. Some weird error having to do with \"Out of memory loading solid.\" Yeah, I have no clue what that means ether. Especially since I was just working on a map that dwards this one. Like comparing the Earth to Jupiter! Any ways, this is the reason why I'm uploading this map as of its 25% only completion. Like I said its playable and some what fun. Fast past though, on a count of it being slightly smaller then the original Iceworld version(still getting used to the SDK ya know:)    \r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n4.Notes/errors:\r\n\r\nAs I said the SDK crashed on me which means the map is DEAD! To explain in more detail..\r\n\r\n a.Lighting is way off\r\n\r\n b.Brushes and textures are not aligned and/or are slightly out of place and size.\r\n\r\n c.The gun placement is a little crowded. I was going to space them out but at least this way its    more cut throat =)\r\n \r\n d.There are 8vs8 CT and T spawning's, so there is 16 spawns in all, but the Bots where not given    proper info_nodes, well actually there are no nodes for them to use but they do work because I    did test it out(they bunch up and move together some times though.)\r\n\r\n e.There is most likely a lot more problems with the map then I can even think of right now so I    apologize for this, but the map, as it is is still very playable. So at least try it out and     see what you think of it for your self. \r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n5.Author and Acknowledgments:\r\n\r\n + Map by: Chase aka ArrogantOrange\r\n\r\n + Rocket Model provided by: PISNORONE \r\n\r\n + Tutorials and training provided by: 3kliksphilip You can find him and his tutorials on YouTube    at http://www.youtube.com/user/3kliksphilip\r\n\r\n + A big thanx to Valve(obviously)for their great games and the SOURCE SDK(and other versions) \r\n\r\n + and lastly to the viewers like you who make my learning the SDK possible(yea I did just rip       off PBS:)\r\n-------------------------\r\n-------------------------\r\n-------------------------\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nAlso: PLEASE SEE THE ACCOMPANING .TXT FILE LABLED \"Pertaining to the Rocket_silo Model.txt\" FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE ROCKET_SILO MODEL FILE'S, MATERIAL'S FILE'S AND SO ON!!!! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a video preview for your viewing pleasure provided by www.xfire.com \r\n\r\n<object width=\"405\" height=\"344\"><embed src=\"http://media.xfire.com/swf/embedplayer.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"405\" height=\"344\" flashvars=\"videoid=35db9c\"></embed></object>"
