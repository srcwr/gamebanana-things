	"_sText": "Map works fine on old machines as-well. All you need to do is to put it in your cstrike/maps/ folder, and add it to your map cycle.\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n1. Soccer\r\n2. Big Gun Toss / LR Zone.\r\n3. Pool\r\n4. Team Activator checker for the weapons door\r\n5. 2 Escaping cells\r\n6. One weapon (Glock-18) cell with 30~ bullets.\r\n7. 'red cell', you can get to it through the soccer (hidden area).\r\n\r\nI'm working on ba jail minecraft a2 right now, the next version will be much better, inclouding: Race, Better LR zone (shot 4 shot, etc.) and more activity zones.\r\n\r\n== extremely important ==\r\nYou need to install textures from this link: http://www.sendspace.com/file/nfjyj5\r\nin order to actually see the map as it is. Extract the .rar in cstrike/meterials."
