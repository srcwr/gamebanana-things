	"_sText": "A port of the classic Quake 3 DeFRaG map \"hangtime-df\" by NSW (NaturalSpringWater). Although most of the stages are at most sort of hard by themselves, the real challenge in this map comes from being able to establish a working route for a good time, as this map is extremely tight and rough to run. Keep in mind that in some cases it may even be faster to just walk forward and do one jump rather than trying to bhop it.<br><br>Casual length: 10 - 20 mins<br>Estimated record length: 5 - 9 mins<br>Difficulty: Hard - Very Hard<br><br>Because I started porting this when I didn't even have Quake 3 installed (I used to do defrag on quake live) I didn't have access to most of the textures that didn't come with this map, so I recplaced them with textures of my own or made by TopHattWaffle and Saspatoon, which, in my opinion, look a lot better. I also added a few extra jumps to help out with movement on some stages. On only one stage did I completely get rid of any elements (second to last stage), and that was because the boosters were really tricky to figure out.<br><br>Anyway, enjoy the map. I'm very interested to see what is humanly possible, and what can only be achieved with TAS.<br><br>You can find a complete Quake 3 run of this map here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDgVPgKI-s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDgVPgKI-s</a><br>You can find the original download for the Quake 3 file here: <a href=\"https://www.q3df.org/records/details?map=hangtime-df\">https://www.q3df.org/records/details?map=hangtime-df</a>"
