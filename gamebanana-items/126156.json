There are no shortcuts or secret places throughout the bhop parts. There are no bugs on this map. Good luck and have fun with it!\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n-fog reduced\r\n\r\n-there are more stages for unexperienced bhoppers\r\n\r\n-the final teleports has been fixed\r\n\r\n-there are checkpoints on the climbing part\r\n\r\n-the very dark skyboxe was changed to a ligher one\r\n\r\n-more spawnpoints has been added"
