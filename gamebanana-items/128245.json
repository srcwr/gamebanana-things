After 3 seconds, the blocks will start breaking when the player runs over them. Below the stage is deadly lava, so watch out! The overall goal is to be the last player alive.\r\n\r\n**Things to note**\r\nBlocks break 0.5 seconds after being touched, meaning speed will have to be accounted. Player's sprinting speed in stamina works perfectly fine. \r\n\r\n**Hey, the lava doesn't kill the player in the video!**\r\nThat's my dev server being weird, I double-checked on singleplayer to make sure I hadn't fucked the trigger_hurt and it was okay, but let me know if there's any issues!"
