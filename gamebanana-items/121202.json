	"_sText": "This is a map based on Metal Gear Solid's underground pass, which is where Snake first fights Sniper Wolf.  It's still not finished as I don't have time, plus I need some custom texture work done from somebody else.  Please tell me if there are any errors especially as far as texturing, lighting, and any suggestions in general.  I was planning to put several more effects, but my copy of Twin Snakes was borrowed.\r\n\r\nAbout the map:  It's essentially a huge hall.  Everyone gets a pistol, a Scout, and a knife.  The Ts spawn on two levels and they can hide using walls and barriers.  There is one grenade per team, the Ts get an HE grenade and the CTs get a smoke grenade, allowing them to advance.  Each team can easily find a FAMAs near their spawn.  Kill the other team to win!\r\n\r\nTHIS MAP IS 4 VS 4 ONLY!"
