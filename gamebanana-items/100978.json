	"_sText": "This is a defuse map based on a cs_hockey as some one asked for a defuse version, it is modified a fair bit to make it work but retains a lot of the original paths. I spent a year off and on working on this, it includes many custom textures and detailed brushwork. I further optimized this map and framerates are great, excellent for 32 player size server. Some features of the map:\r\n\r\n-Full HDR\r\n-40 Players\r\n-Custom textures\r\n-3D skybox\r\n-Custom sound and soundscape\r\n-Fully tweaked nav file\r\n-Overview and radar overview\r\n-All content bsp zipped\r\n\r\nThanks to my friend Furyo for help with render problems and areaportals, visit him at www.froughol.com\r\n\r\nStard00d for the snack machine model visit him at www.d00ds.com\r\n\r\nMy friends at Toronto Darkly for playtesting, visit www.torontodarkly.ca"
