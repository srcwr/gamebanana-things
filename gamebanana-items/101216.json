	"_sText": "Ive paid alot of close attention to the original Dust map, after much discussion between me, Ojos, and Error404, my mate. we decided to settle for the very popular dust style, remove the sea idea. and have a very gameplay based map.\r\n\r\nT's have a hight advantage and can access most roofs with relative ease from spawn. Giving the Terrorists a gain over CT. This will offer a very new take to CSS gameplay, as with adding hight to the gameplay. We have to be careful not to be an easy target from the ground, windows, or other roofs or balconys. Ofcourse, Terrorsists can take other routes at ground level. \r\n\r\nCt spawn very close to both bombsites. Yet bombsite B is ontop of a building. which is not easily accessable from near CT spawn, so CT cant sit around gaurding the bombsites too easily. Just to make it even harder. Terrorists spawn next to 4 extra C4bombs. therefore meaning Terrorists have a great chance of planting the bomb!\r\n\r\nThis is a new and experienmental take on the gameplay of css. and with abit of luck it may prove popular and a good bit of alternative fun from the usual gameplay."
