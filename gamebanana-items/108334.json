	"_sText": "Hey guys!\r\nI am releasing my first CS:S map.\r\nIt's name is aim_pillars_v1, a very small map for a maximum of 6 players - perfectly for playing with friends or using it on a small public server to keep the players aim well. :)\r\n\r\nThere are alot of pillars on the map, which makes getting shots on target a real aiming challenge.\r\nIn addition, in the middle of the map is a large gap that separates the two spawns and cannot be passed without dying.\r\nThis forces you to keep distance to your enemy and you'll have to aim very accurate.\r\nThe pillars offer perfect cover against all kind of weapons, even AWP's will not hurt you if positioned behind a pillar.\r\n\r\nEvery team gets all the important weapons (M4, AK47, MP5, Deagle, AWP, Famas, HE-grenades ect. ...).\r\n\r\nAttention:\r\nI plan doing more versions of aim_pillar maps for a larger amount of players (12-20).\r\nThis was the very first map I ever created and i would really appreciate CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. ;)"
