	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map CS_BOATHOUSE_HDR<br><br>Nav Creator: Meurglis3, Release Date: June 4 2018<br><br>Here is the Navigation Mesh for good twisted assault-themed map <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/119132\">cs_boathouse_hdr</a> by fenceareus / Patzilla (released December 2009). It's a totally created from scratch and manually optimized (hand-tuned) .nav-file because in original map author's archive was included slightly edited and almost unplayable auto-gen (embedded in .bsp).<br><br>More than 60% of all areas were created manually because during an auto-generation processing the majority of them were constructed incorrectly (especially doorways, windows and ladders).<br><br>Well... bots have opportunity to use all walkable ways and they surely move according to all areas of the map (except for the yacht standing on building berths, which has seemed to me a little excessive for smoothness of a gameplay). Especially as Charon is ready to take for a drive absolutely free of charge on the boat all visitors of this strange coastal corner :-)<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map author available to downloading with the <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/119132\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also all your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: fenceareus / Patzilla (for fine designed and high detailed bikini-styled map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>There's a little black spot on the sun today, it's the same old thing as yesterday :-)<br><br>"
