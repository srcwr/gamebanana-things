The four bouldings on the sides have stairs down to two halls, having some wheels for cover (don't worry, they're static :P). The two staircases that go down the holes in the ground leads to a small labyrinth. There's windows (with bars) between the labyrinth section in the middle and the halls.\r\n\r\nI didn't care much for adding proper light sources, so you will just have to cope with this\r\n\r\nI haven't played this on any server, this is the first release so I don't know how well this will play.. Anyways, have fun :D\r\n\r\nNAV FILE UPLOADED TOMORROW"
