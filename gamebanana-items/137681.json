I don't know, but you got it ANYWAY! Surf_cityscape. It's what a city would like if it was made for surfing! You literally have no choice but to LOVE THIS MAP.\r\n\r\nBOOM!\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, i just made this map for a change. It's dev textured, as you can see, which i'm not too thrilled about, but i'm more lazy than i am annoyed, so there we go. It's quite large, and i didn't really think about the layout too much. Take a look at the video to see how it surfs, or try it out yourself. I'm sure there will be a few problems, but my biggest worry is that people will find it too hard to surf, either in difficulty, or just 'cause of poor ramp placement (although maybe not; i find it fairly easy, as you will see on the aforementioned video). Have fun. Stay surfing. I want to see more combat maps. Boom!\r\n\r\n<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/7RtcXG_R0ZE&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/7RtcXG_R0ZE&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></object>"
