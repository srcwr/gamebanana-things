No bhop (On 66 tick, consistency is impossible).\r\n\r\n\r\nI made it. Could be bugs, dunno. Haven't really tested this version.\r\nIf you're falling through the platform on level 9, try jumping on the platform until it departs. (Thanks, Source.)\r\nPretty sure it's 40 max players. Could be 64. Could be 100. Dunno."
