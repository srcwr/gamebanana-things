But I did spend a fair while on it, so give me some kudos for that :)\r\n\r\nIt IS a bit dark, but it's really fun playing gg dark like that.\r\nBuyzones are there, but you can disable them if you want (?)\r\n\r\nIt's not textured, because I can't be bothered. If requested, I will release a textured version sometime."
