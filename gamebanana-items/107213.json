Revived it recently and decided to make it a aim map. \r\n\r\nNot completely happy about the result, but it's good enough for my shooting map ( not considering aim_skyfitaz then)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map has HDR lighting. If your pc cannot handle HDR, simply remove it by typing mat_hdr_enabled 0 in console.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAT IZ ALL!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this."
