Made in 1 day, less. \r\nI kinda was inspired by some skins I saw, so I made up a pack of \"Desert\" themed skins. \r\nAnd so the idea of this map was born. \r\nIt combinds Valves De_Dust2 & De_Dust. \r\nNote; I did not de-compile the maps.\r\n\r\nBeta;\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/148841\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\nThis maps features;\r\nLots of Decals.\r\nTwo Towers.\r\nMany many props from Dust2 & Dust.\r\nAi Noded. (Un intentionally.)\r\nMultiple spawns. 30+\r\nCustom made SkyBox.\r\nMultiple features from Dust2 & Dust.\r\n+ Lots more, as seen in images. \r\n\r\nServer using map;\r\n69.197.191.101:27015\r\n\r\nOKAY. \r\n\r\nThere are custom textures, I don't have the tools required to include them in the bsp. So.. I simply gave you the materials inside the \"Materials\"  folder.                                              \r\n\r\n- Requests - \r\nPlease leave some feedback on bugs here.\r\nPlease Rate this map.\r\nIf someone could, make a Video for this map and post a link here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks'\r\n\r\n\r\nEJHF\r\n"
