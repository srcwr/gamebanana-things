It contains 10 very short stages and a bonus(the bonus is not anything special, but I put in a basic one so servers can have the option for a bonus involved).\r\n\r\nI have done surf maps in the past for TF2 but this is my first CSS map and my first bhop map, so if I've missed anything or there are any bugs please let me know. Feedback is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis was tested with 1000 AA on a local server, so I hope it's enjoyable with autohop, but everything should be doable in scroll settings.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
