	"_sText": "quick map i made when i was bored.\r\n\r\nbasically you have to jump from platform to platform, as they will break shortly after being touched.  the idea is to cut people off and still be standing after one minute.\r\nif you fall, you go to the \"jail\" in the center, where you knife other fallers, if anyone outlasts the minute, then they will teleport above the jail with access to nades and a deagle, and can clean up the people in jail. quick gameplay, but still pretty amusing.\r\ntry it out, rate, and have fun."
