Great map for both long distance sniping and close range carnage. Weapons on ground at spawn in addition to buy zones at both spawns to keep the rounds very fast paced.\r\n\r\nAll polygons based on optimized dimensions to reach a very small download size. (only 2 meg unzipped)\r\n\r\nServerspy.net ranked my server #1 in Canada with much thanks to this map and my other customs. Look up -:{V!P}:- Cappys Playground at 69.9.38.164:27015 to try this and my other customs out for yourself. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and be sure to let me know if it gets additional props when you run it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAl_Capwned (a.k.a Cappy)"
