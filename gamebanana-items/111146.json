I decided to rename it because of the new layout doesn't really look like a prison.\r\nSo now I decided to name it EC_paint_ball_fight EC standing for Exaulted Chaos of coarse and paint_ball_fight because it reminds me of a paint ball field. It is almost complete I just have to make a few finishing touches, like more props and deciding if I want to put in some water."
