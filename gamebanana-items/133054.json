	"_sText": "This new version of the map is hardly altered at the request of the community responsible for presenting the notion of a re texture.  The idea of the map was to keep it simple as it was one of my first maps many years ago. Iâ€™ve made a few small changes to dramatically improve game play and add more balance to the map. I hope you guys enjoy the map.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n\r\nTopHATTwaffle Textures\r\nToxin Textures\r\nNote: this map is not an accurate depiction of my work as it is very old and lacks detail. Please do not comment or rate it low because of its appearance I will be releasing new maps soon for those who like graphics. \r\n\r\nThank you \r\n-Crazy[Virus]"
