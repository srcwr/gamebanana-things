CT spawns in the Cabin, T spawns outside near the gate or the guard building as I like to call it.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secret teleporters and there is a teleporter that traps glitchers in the fire room (aka the Jail).\r\n\r\nAlso in one of the rooms there is a back door so look out if you choose to camp there.\r\n\r\nUpdated Skybox and a few props. Also I made the roof higher in the jail room area."
