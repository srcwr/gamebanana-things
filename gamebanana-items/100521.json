	"_sText": "My second release, three weeks in the making (most of that because it kept crashing or hanging during the compile), I present cs_texture_villa!\r\n\r\nI wanted to try my hand at making a decent cs map ^^; there're four hossies that need saving from the terrorist stronghold, and two extraction points to choose from. The map supports upto 42 players, has two CT and one T spawn, and the rooves are accessible from multiple points across the map. \r\n\r\nIf you fancy it, it should also be good for GG as well!\r\n\r\nThe Radar - I did try to embed it in the BSP but it doesn't seem to be working that way; if someone would like to look at the BSP and tell me what I'm doing wrong, that'd be great; for now, it's included as seperate files.\r\n\r\nThanks to SmmS for the encouragement & positive feedback from my previous map, gg_hextower - give it a look, it plays quite well!"
