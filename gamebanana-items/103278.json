Contact Sk3tch at www.sk3maps.com.\r\n\r\n***NOTE*** THE NAV FILE IS PENDING FROM Chizbone\r\n\r\nThis map has been edited from the original due to the CS:S june23, 2010 update making the former \"de_cevo_nighthawk\"unplayable due to texture issues.\r\nThe following has been fixed or added to the map:\r\n\r\n-Made the environment daytime.\r\n-Removed unnecessary props that got into players paths.\r\n-optimized the map more with 10 fps gain in general.\r\n-made ramp on bombsite with jet longer and easier to access for future bot use.\r\n-fixed random errors.\r\n-removed the battle noises as it seemed to \"lag\" lower end users.\r\n-changed the ground dirt to sand. (easier to see players).\r\n-cleared props in narrow hallway near jet hangar.\r\n-Adjusted player spawns for more even gameplay.\r\n-Adjusted prop fade.\r\n-All files except NAV included in the BSP file.\r\n\r\nAny issues please contact me!\r\n\r\n"
