The addition of props also makes this map more bearable to some who are quality freaks.\r\n\r\nTo me, and my friends and to the people that helped test it, this map is a very fun and simple design. It plays flawlessly, the balance is pretty good as well.\r\n\r\n---->Support for 64 Players, Recommended is 16-24.\r\n\r\n\r\n*If you are adding this map to your server please let me know as I would like to try it out with other players* I will be running this level off of my own server as well IP - 63.215.74.166:27015.\r\n\r\nNote- my server 63.215.74.166:27015 has over 60+ custom maps, not including my own. \r\n\r\nCheers."
