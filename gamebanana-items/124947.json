	"_sText": "<u><i><b>If this map is very bright for you, disable high dynamic range.<br><br></b></i></u>Main map - 5 min seg, 10+ min casually<br><br>Bonus - 20 sec~<br><br>This\r\n is a map I have been working on for quite some time. Originally, parts \r\nof the stages were meant to be for the bhop 2020 tournament but I \r\nrealised I didn't have time to detail it to the extent i wanted to, so I\r\n decided to just go all out on what will be my final bhop map (besides \r\nmaybe a few collabs or something here and there)  This map consists of 8\r\n stages with completely varied gameplay. The difficulty goes up each \r\nstage, kinda like Sqee.  Never really used hdr before and it seems a bit\r\n weird on this map but nobody complained whilst testing so hopefully \r\nnone of you find it an issue either. I really did try to make this map something totally different from what I usually upload and I hope y'all like it.<br><br>Thanks, and have fun!<br><br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_sI-vN9244\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"
