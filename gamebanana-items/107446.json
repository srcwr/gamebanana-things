For each T is a deagle, a glock and a ak_47 and for each CT a deagle, a usp and a m4 available.\r\n\r\nthis aim-map represents for the CT's the Stargate Center, on the way to a mission.\r\n\r\nAfter all the CT's have passed the Stargate, it should close. This is untested. Should close the gate before all the Ct's have gone through, then contact me.\r\nThanks."
