I'm on my 4th fix. This is really pissing me off. Fall damage being disabled SHOULD be working now. If it's not, please tell me. For some reason it just wasn't working. Or maybe I'm fucking retarded. Made some of the traps more noob friendly, removed 64 unit jumps, removed unneeded textures, and something I'm probably forgetting to mention.\r\n\r\nThe lighting can be dealt with at another time as it really isn't that important."
