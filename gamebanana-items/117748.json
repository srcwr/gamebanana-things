I've released a few final versions of this map as a zombie map, but since i made a few changes to it so it'll work for dm, I need to know what you think about it. I'd like to have as many assessments on this map as possible and as much CONSTRUCTIVE criticism as possible to help improve this map.\r\n\r\nThis map does have buy zones for each team and turrets/projectile launchers all around the map.\r\n\r\nI will try and release a video for this map to help show what's in it everything like that.\r\n\r\nbut PLEASE assess this map and tell me any problems you may have with it. I am considering removing the rain i have in the map to improve fps and lower ping on the map."
