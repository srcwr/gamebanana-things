It's going to be a huge defuse map (complete with a NAV file and radar; the works!) with some custom textures and perhaps an edited HEV suit model. This is the most ambitious project I'm creating, and I need your feedback. More Alphas will be released in the future alongside development! I understand the landing bay is horribly bland. Sorry about that."
