	"_sText": "I made this a while back in a map called gg_zomg_ownt. I made the map for a friend and I thought the towers I used in it turned out really good. So I'm now deciding to put them in as a prefab for everyone to use.\r\n\r\nThere is a CT and a T fortress tower, T has red lights, CT has blue lights. \r\n\r\nIf you use this in your map PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT for making the prefab.\r\n\r\nTo install them for use, you just have to simply extract the file anywhere on your computer, then go into sourceSDK and click 'open' the browse to the spot you put them in and click on the file then open it. It's easiest to put them in this folder: C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\username\\sourcesdk_content\\cstrike\\mapsrc since sourceSDK opens from that folder on default, they'll be right there when you look for them."
