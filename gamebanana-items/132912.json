	"_sText": "This was the first map i had ever made. I wasn't very creative and didn't know where to start, so i decided i'd just remake q2dm1 from Quake 2. That was my favourite game, so why not? Map has a bunch of secrets, hold spots, and cade spots. It's not the greatest map, and i didn't make it very well at all. I was just procrastinating posting it here. Originally i had the plan of getting rid of the Plaguefest sign in one of the secrets and make a seperate release for the public, but it doesn't really matter. If you need to change it on your own, just message me for the VMF and i'll gladly give it to you.\r\n\r\nAlso, i don't know why the file size is so big, i probably used a rediculous model or didn't scale down custom textures.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- Can get stuck in some displacements\r\n- Water can reflect weird sometimes (cubemaps issue i think), couldn't figure out why at the time"
