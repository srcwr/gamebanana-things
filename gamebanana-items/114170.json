(In this case a high security one because for 46 lockers there are 2 offices and 2 guard stations)\r\n\r\nThe entire map is as mirrored as I could make it but it's off by a few small, unimportant inches. Of the 46 lockers the players can get into 6 of the 8 open ones. There is access to the rooftops but there is little cover there. In addition there are a few vehicles.\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\nI guess you can't have much of a story when it comes to FY_ maps but I can imagine that the Ts have broken into the compound in an attempt to steal something."
