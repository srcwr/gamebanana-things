Basically consists of three \"floors\" - a factory floor with ladders up to a rooftop where you can shoot down at the people below and a flooded basement underneath with multiple access points...  \r\n\r\nWe've run it on our servers and it's a lot of fun, so please try it out and let us know what you think.  As it is my first map, if I've done stuff wrong/badly, I would really like to know....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
