	"_sText": "ZM_ECHO_WAREHOUSE_BETA\r\nCreated By: £cho\r\n\r\nLast Updated: April 20, 2008\r\nMaximum Spawn Points: 64\r\nRecommend Player Count: 24-32\r\nAverage FPS (for me locally): 200-300FPS\r\n\r\nA recently abandoned warehouse has been suspiciously quiet after recent reports of undead activity. With little communication, the first SWAT units to arrive on scene were never to be seen again, and you are dispatched with a second battalion to find the missing units and rid of the zombies once and for all.\r\n\r\nNot the best plot, I know, but the map is actually quite detailed. I used a new lighting technique I've been absolutely dying to try out, and I think it came out really nice. The interiors of both buildings are covered in decals and barricading areas, while the outside receives the nighttime lighting and plenty of areas to climb. This is a beta version, and there's no 3D skybox as I didn't get around to making one yet, but you can be sure that it will be included in the next release, so please try not to complain too much again that.\r\n\r\nAs always, feel free to express your own opinion about the map!\r\nI'd love to hear what players have to say. ^_^\r\nIt's been a while since I've gotten around to releasing a map on FPSB. =D\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho"
