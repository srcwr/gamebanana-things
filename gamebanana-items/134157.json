I made this map over the course of 5 days on and off.\r\n\r\n   Of course, this map is very similar to my gg_churches_x map, but this is the updated and final version. You will find all the new features that have been updated below. I planned for more features but took them out due to many reasons. Gungame maps are about fun and not so much realism or details so I took out things like elaborate background scenery and buildings, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW FEATURES\r\n------------\r\n\r\n** Bomb site's items now explode!\r\n** Environmental sounds to add realism!\r\n** Interior high platform inside each church now destructible!\r\n** Destructible plants on outer walls!\r\n** More trees and other plant-life!\r\n** AND -- A whole new area of action on the sides with a gazebo!\r\n** Much more!\r\n\r\n\r\nFIXED BUG:\r\n\r\nI fixed the skybox leak/tear effect on the sides. It's 99% fixed. Not 100% but 99%. So when you download now, you'll have gg_churches_x_final_fixed -- I renamed it with \"_fixed\" because too many people don't know to delete the old map file if a server won't let them connect saying they have the wrong version.\r\n\r\nOTHER NOTES:\r\n\r\nThis map is very fun and is defininitely the last I'll make of churches. It's far superior to gg_churches_x in my opinion but let me know your thoughts. Thanks guys and have fun!\r\n\r\nAs awlays, come play with me on my server:\r\n\r\n\r\n72.26.102.140:27015\r\n\r\nWarmFuzzyLand - 100 Tick Gun Game\r\n\r\n\r\n-Air"
