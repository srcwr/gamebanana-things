They go through the channel crossing the map; in the tunnel; on the wall near bombsite A; they jump into the holes in the wall that leads to tunnel and walk freely on the water... Walk freely everywhere! :D\r\n\r\nAlso, added place names, so bots will tell you where the enemy is, where the bomb, etc. But to avoid confusion in the future, I recommend you to run on a map alone and learn how located the place names, then...\r\n\r\nJust have fun ;)\r\n\r\nUPDATE 17.08.2014: Accelerated exit of bots from both respawns. Bots getting stuck beside crates on bombsites - fixed. And some minor improvements."
