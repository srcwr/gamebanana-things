This is simple bridge prefab I did long time ago, found it today and I thought while it's not pretty it could be useful to someone.\r\nYou can modify, re-size, change textures... and so on but credit is a must. **You need to credit me if you use this prefab!** Made to CS:S and planned to use in Garry's Mod, but you can use it basically any source game, just change the textures.\r\nI guess I have smaller version from this bridge in my PC , I might put it here too. :)"
