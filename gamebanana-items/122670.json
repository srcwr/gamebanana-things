It's pretty good I think, had to change a few things, too many parts that didn't work etc. I have plans for v2, but for some reason, don't ask why, the file became huge at the moment (46mb uncompressed!) but don't worry, the .rar is less than 1meg! as I've heard from another map, if you put it on a server, you have to allow downloading size to over 46mb to allow them to download, but they might be there a long time (sorry) so i don't know whether I should put in a light environment or not...probably a bad idea, but I'll take your opinion!"
