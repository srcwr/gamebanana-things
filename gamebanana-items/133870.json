	"_sText": "This is a real fun gg map.  I use it for DM server.  Included a 3D skybox and a seperate texture for the CT/T sides to help with any confusion of team spawns.  One way glass on the platforms to help keep camping minimal.  Im a big fan of not geting to fancy with to much detail, I stick with the better fps and playable theory.  20 players max, includes nav file.  Open to all constructive criticism."
