So I spent time on it with my studio, and this version 1 came to fininalize. \r\n\r\nIncludes: \r\n\r\n- Buildings with Props, decals, lighting.\r\n- Breakable Windows, Vents.\r\n- Sounds.\r\n- Fog.\r\n- Various Camping Spots.\r\n- Optimization.\r\n\r\nSince this is only Version 1, I could make version 2 much bigger, or change alot of rooms and such."
