	"_sText": "This map takes place at night (map is really dark) and only uses dust maps textures.<br>This is a 35HP map, meaning a really little map.<br><br><br><b>Text updated:</b> February 2020<br>It was initially planned to put this map a few weeks before putting a really big map on CS:S (jail map) I took a several hundred of hours to make. Unfortunately, the map has not been finished so I didn't post the map and then I left CS:S. I am however proud of still seeing this on gamebanana, and I hope you'll like the map! Thanks for the downloads &amp; views guys &amp; girls!<br><br><b>Diablos</b>"
