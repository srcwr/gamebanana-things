	"_sText": "Hello all,\r\n\r\nTiny little update on de_westwood. I hear tons of people complaining about the annoying fog/dust. I removed it and now the map is much much better. \r\n\r\nAs I didnot have the textures I had to remake the textures for this map. They are slightly different but it's fine.\r\n\r\nAll the honor goes to the mapmaker : cc_nipper. You can comment on his map in the link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gamebanana.com/maps/12691\r\n\r\nHave fun and play fair!\r\n\r\nps; If you want to have bots on this map. Dowload the .nav from the original de_westwood (see link above) and rename .nav to de_westwood_no_fog. Voila, you've got your bots."
