In this Defuse map theres three houses in everysingle house spawns ct [there are 3houses] Terrorists spawn outside, terrorists have to break into one of the houses tru the door,cave,vent and plant the bomb. Max Counter-Terrorists count is 3, Max Terrorists count is 10. I recommend you play 3 vs 3 or 2v2 but of course play with real people because thats way more fun but if you can't do that just play with bots.<br><br>Known bugs:<br>Buggy vents<br>invisible ladder in third house's cave<br>Ct's can spawn into eatch other I don't know how to fix that [its rare]<br><br>Theres way more bugs but I forgot almost all of them so yeah.<br>Please have in mind that i made this map for testing and after like 2hours I made this map have a good gameplay and really fun i played this map with my 2friends and one bot.
