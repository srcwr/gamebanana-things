You should go to CGN surf servers if you want to play it, because as far as I know they are the ones that ported it_).\r\n\r\nThe map has been edited again to make it a bit easier, the purpose of this map was t4-t5 but it turned out t6 before, now it should be fine. The map has been renamed to surf_motion1 as I will propably create surf_motion2 in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, this is a linear surf map, surfing it takes about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThings that have been made in this version:\r\n#Green \"stage\"\r\n- Nothing has been changed,\r\n\r\n#Blue \"stage\"\r\n- Made the spin a bit easier,\r\n- Replaced the first bhop parts with ramps,\r\n- Made the last bhop part easier to do on high ping,\r\n\r\n#Yellow \"stage\"\r\n- Made the first jump easier,\r\n- Fixed the boost near the end so you can have more control on the ramp,\r\n\r\n#White \"stage\"\r\n- Nothing has been changed,\r\n\r\n#Orange \"stage\"\r\n- The whole stage has been remade (excluding the first ramp),\r\n\r\n#Red \"stage\"\r\n- Everything has been remade until the first spin,\r\n- Made the ending easier (bigger gaps between the \"columns\","
