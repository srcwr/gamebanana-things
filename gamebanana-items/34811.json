Use night vision and prick up ears... or wait while fog will dissipate :D\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Moroes (for his terrible and thrilled industrial-themed map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nStoneface dog, swirling fog, gates open on the dark dark night! :-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 26.11.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Place Names are changed (replaced on more corresponding to environment);\r\n- Some other minor improvements.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
