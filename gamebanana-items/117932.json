	"_sText": "This is just the first beta of a map that I made for my friend's CS:S server. \r\nYou'll definately want about...20 people playing for it to be really crazy. \r\nWe have been playing it with GunGame:Deathmatch. I would also recommend that you turn the servers gravity to about 500 to prevent death from falling too much. Oh, and as Screenshot E shows, that big black mass in the middle actually has water like properties. I was having alot of problems with getting the water to render right, it kept letting you see through walls and what not, so I placed that illusionary cover over it. \r\n\r\nHope ya enjoy ^.^\r\n\r\nPlease PM me any real problems you face, or if you have a suggestion to add into it. \r\n\r\nThe final version will not be released here, but on my website for the server.\r\n\r\nBots are dumb here."
