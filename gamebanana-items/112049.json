	"_sText": "This is the first map I ever actually completed that wasn't just one side versus another. I made this one a couple years back, hence the too short doors and general lack of detail. I have given up on it totally, having moved on to other, better looking projects.\r\n\r\nThe map itself has multiple paths for both teams to take. Both teams have access to a joined vent that leads up to a rooftop, bot have a corridor that leads to the center, CT has ladder access to the rooftops, and T has easy access to the sewers. The sewers link to the basement which has two other exits to the surface. There is also a couple hidden rooms in this map, but I'll let you guys find those yourselves. ;P\r\n\r\nAnyways, have fun with it. I did, even against bots."
