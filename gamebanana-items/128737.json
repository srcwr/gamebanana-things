	"_sText": "This is my new release. Was originally made for another clan, but the clan died out, and yea, I just had it lying around..\r\n\r\nThe map is a course map, with some easy and some hard obstacles. Made for a decent minigame player.\r\nIt has more than enough spawns. (Don't remember exact, but I remember it was more than 32 at least.)\r\n\r\nIn the end, all other players are slayed, except the winner. The winner can then choose between three prizes. 1: Invisibility all next rounds. 2: many points. 3: many points and teleport to a longjump bonus. If the player can do the longjump bonus, he is rewarded with even more points.\r\n\r\nThanks :)"
