	"_sText": "Gentlemen, I give you surf_timewarp, a new tier 6, 5 staged map.\r\n\r\nIt took me upwards from 8 months to finish this, and most agree it was worth the wait. The map has a general theme, you travel through time attempting to assassinate an evil emperor. Pretty generic as far as stories go but hey, I tried. Stages each have tangible themes: stage 1 is ancient egypt, stage 2 is medieval times, stage 3 is the 1800's, stage 4 is the emperor's palace, and stage 5 is the time machine.\r\n\r\nDon't be surprised if you get frustrated, it's a tough map. But a lot of people seem to appreciate that nowadays. It has no jail, but that's because I don't really care enough to make one.\r\n\r\nRelease Thread: http://forums.solidsurf.info/index.php/topic,3455.0.html\r\n\r\nDevelopment Thread:\r\nhttp://forums.solidsurf.info/index.php/topic,3241.0.html\r\n\r\nintox.
