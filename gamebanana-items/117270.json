I encourage you to give me any feedback (constructive only, please) that will help me improve this map and my mapping abilities.\r\n\r\na.) Two forts contain spawns for CT and T.\r\nb.) The warehouse is not very well-lit considering budget cuts that result in some failing light fixtures.\r\nc.) There are plenty of crate towers around, some barrels and a catwalk for those who like to be on top.\r\nd.) The terrorist base contains a switch that can turn on/off the lights for some eerie flashlight fun.\r\ne.) The lights are destructible themselves.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nJack Waters"
