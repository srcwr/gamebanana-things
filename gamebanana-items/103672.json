Workers are on run fearing police to arrest them from having printed money. As terrorist your task is to destroy evidence by starting massive fire from oil tank (A) or looting the money stash from safe (B).\r\n\r\nMap includes:\r\n-Custom skybox ( thank you komaokc :D )\r\n-Custom decals made by me\r\n-32 spawns\r\n-3d skybox, fog, and rain effects + ambience\r\n-Some details also and much more\r\n\r\nI made map in hurry and it's not exactly perfect but I tried my best. Feel free to comment, rate, ask, report bugs... have fun!"
