	"_sText": "Hey ! I'm back with new sauna map ! It's been ages since I published a map but here's the new saunataikuri ! Some people may ask why its v3 since there's no v2 in banana , but there's simple explanation ;  I haven't published v2 but I will in future. I thought that v2 will be the last version but this map has turned into trilogy and hopefully this final version is the best of all\r\n\r\nNew features : \r\n\r\n1# More outdoor action.\r\n2# You can climb on the roof. YAY !\r\n3# I made just one bombsite for reason that two sites don't fit in saunamaps. But that's only my opinion and it still has balanced gameplay\r\n4# And last but not least there's 4 secrets to find !\r\n\r\nPleaaaaaase leave a comment and rate of course !\r\nThanks and cya in the future ! (hopefully)"
