	"_sText": "Well this was a project that i started about 3 months ago, i started this project because of a friend who kept bugging me to make a jail map for Garry's Mod. But it quickly turned into a CS:S map, although i might come out with a version for Garry's Mod if their is a big enough request.\r\n\r\nWell here are the details for this map;\r\n- Large cages\r\n- Fully Stocked Armory\r\n- Realistic feel\r\n- Vents\r\n- Soccer\r\n\r\nAnd other thing that you can find by your selves.\r\n\r\nAnd FYI i did add the decals with Pakrat and there are NO VIRUSES\r\n\r\nAbout 75% into this map i decided to make this map for one of my favorite server.\r\n\r\n{TG}\r\n\r\nHere is their IP if u want to check it out.\r\n\r\n69.162.88.108:27015\r\n\r\nWell that it about this map I hope u enjoy it as much as i did making it!"
