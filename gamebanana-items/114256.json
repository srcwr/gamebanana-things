Merge the maps folder with the maps folder in your cstrike folder.\r\n_____\r\nI noticed there isn't much cover in the center of the map (if you are playing with guns, not knifes that is). I'll improve upon it and make more cover points in V2. This isn't nearly my best effort, but it's a theme for a map I've really wanted to make! I'll probably make one not as seizure inducing.\r\n______________________\r\n\r\n<fieldset><center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/I16Ms.gif\" /></center></fieldset>"
