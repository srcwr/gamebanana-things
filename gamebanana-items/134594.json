	"_sText": "This is a map that consists of 2 perfectly symetrical bases that. The CTs and the Ts both spawn in different bases away from eachother and can make their way toward the middle. The best way to beat the opposing team is to rush their base and attack them from the inside. \r\n\r\nIn the middle of this map is water which goes down very deep. There are HE grenades at the bottom. You can risk going down that, but you'll start getting hurt on your way back up. You will end up healing yourself from the health taken from nearly drowning, so the risk of drowning is good if it could mean getting a multikill with a nade. \r\n\r\nI would recommend about 30 people to play on this map at once, anything over 50 will lag the map, but anything over 30, and the maps tends to get a bit crouded. \r\n\r\nThis map was made for Gungame style game play, but would also work excellent as a Deathmatch style game. There are no weapons on the ground (other than nades) and no buy zones, so this map is not any good for normal game play unless if you want to have pistols and nades only."
