	"_sText": "A simple gun game map based in a shopping center with no shops. The doors are automatic, and open before the player reaches the doorway, so you dont bump into them.\r\n\r\nVery easy map to make, took me 10-15min, but thought I would release it anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is also a custom prop on the map for the fun of it. A Tooheys Extra dry beer bottle.\r\n\r\nEnjoy"
