	"_sText": "So this is my first map i have ever bothered to finish and my first release. \r\n\r\nI have \"made\" some maps before, but 90% of them were just tests for skyboxes and so on.\r\n\r\nPeople who have played CS 1.6 will know this map immediately. I got a lot of inspiration from the map cs_mansion.\r\nok to be honest. this is almost like a remake of the map. it looks a lot like it, but it still isn't completely the same.  \r\n\r\nAnyways, i hope you will enjoy the map as much as enjoyed it while making it.\r\n\r\n- Chickenchief\r\n\r\nPS: this map is not final. if you have any tips and so on to make it better, please tell me."
