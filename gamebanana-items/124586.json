	"_sText": "Hi, this is the 4th map in my \"bhop_insertcolorglow\" series, in this one i focused more on making the map longer as well as adding some fairly difficult shortcuts for more advanced players, this involves multiple 64 unit shortcuts, some shortcuts along the walls like in previous maps for both advanced and mid level players.<br><br>The map is like always possible on scroll as well as auto, as for other styles i dont really care too much about, for example low gravity. (rly silly imo) So for low grav or \"unreal\" you might hit some player clips above you, but the map is intended for auto/scroll so if you decide to play low gravity or something similar then you will just have to deal with that.<br><br>The map should be around 50-60 seconds if all shortcuts are used, however i dont have any proof of this cuz i havent seen anyone actually complete it all in one go during play testing which people did during previous maps, so hopefully this one will be a bit more challenging, and if its too difficult or too simple, please let me know in the comments below.&nbsp;<br><br>Other than that, hope you enjoy the map, have fun bhoppin' :3"
