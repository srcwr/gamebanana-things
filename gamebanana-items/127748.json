This will work on any server, with any settings.\r\n\r\n6 Points per win, Ball starts on CT side and Terrorists can get into position before ct start.\r\n\r\nThis map contains Custom Models as well as Custom textures and 60 player Spawns... 30 Per Team\r\n\r\nSoundscapes, Visual effects, and a Tallyboard display the points each team has. This map is relatively small in file size and big on visuals. I hope you all like it\r\n\r\n****CTS SERVE FIRST**** \r\nJOIN THE CT TEAM TO TEST MAP BY YOURSELF"
