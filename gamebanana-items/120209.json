(No long distances/small holes etc.) Too lazy to change the name :P\r\n\r\nI think that the map is pretty good looking, even I finished it in a hurry, out of the way for my brilliant idea in the next map. \r\nThe map is symmetric, and theres a SECRET ROOM.\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n-Buyzone\r\n-secret room\r\n-24 Spawns (12 Each, not sure maybe more or less ;D)"
