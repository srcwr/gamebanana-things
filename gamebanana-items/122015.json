Stage/part 1 is max speed most of the time and stage/part 2 is a bit slower with more obstacles. The map was made for timer servers so there isn't much to do after beating it other than learning shortcuts and getting better times. I may release the full version in the future with bonuses, secrets, and extras at the end but it's very unlikely since I don't have much free time anymore."
