These will give you an advantage against your opponents, because everybody spawn with nothing but a knife. But it isn't easy to get these - you get them with your life as effort.\r\nThe map is created by \"Ritter\", \"Yuggi:D\" and \"twistedVoid\", who's name is abbreviated to \"tV\" on the map's credits wall.\r\n"
