I loved the map, and I thoungh it had A Lot of potencial. So I decided to come with this version.\r\nThis was my biggest project to this date\r\n\r\n<b>DIFERENCES:</b>\r\n\r\n- Re_Textured;\r\n- Players can go on the roofs;\r\n- Added 3D_Sky Box;\r\n- Coveres all the map and blocking brushes with PlayerClip tool;\r\n- Little diference in the layout;\r\n- Added Props;\r\n- More detailed;\r\n- Tryed to optimize the map so much has I could to get higher FPS;\r\n- Realistic effects;\r\n\r\nI Hope you like this version, credits to Pingo_Tinto for letting me remake his map.\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE</b>: The rar. file is now on! (Credits to ma bro Chizbone.)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
