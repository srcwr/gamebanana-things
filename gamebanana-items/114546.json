	"_sText": "Welcome to Fight Yard Taboo!\r\n\r\nThis secret Prodigy training yard was buried amongst the endless tunnels and passage ways beep in the Prodigy military compound. Due to the small size and relatively close contact with the enemy a sharp eye and lightning fast reaction is needed to survive, everyone must constantly be on the move with very few places to camp this training yard will test your skills and your endurance!\r\n\r\nYou will be dropped into Fight Yard Taboo with only your side arms, scattered around the yard are 7 HE nads. Hold on to these and make good use of them. If you chose to offer your participants alternative weapons let the noobs have there sniper rifles they’ll probably never get to use them! ;)\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nAny way blah blah, foo bar…\r\n\r\nThis map was created and intended to be run with CS:S DM (http://www.bailopan.net/cssdm/)\r\n\r\nHow ever being a Beta release this offers me and the larger community to decide if weapons should be dropped into the map like normal \"FY\" maps or if buy zones should be added or leave it alone.\r\n\r\nI am open to any constructive criticism that improves this maps playability, I know CS:S DM is popular but not on every servers so if weapons are desirable please chime in!\r\n\r\nI can't get bzip2 to do it's thing right now vista has gone crazy so no .bz2 file right now, at 3.54Mb this map is small but a .bz2 does come in handy! I'll include this when I release a final map but most should know how to make it!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nInstalling is simple copy or move fy_taboo_beta.bsp and fy_taboo_beta.nav to your map folder, normally found at:\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\STEAM_ID\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nProject page: http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/projects/view/20680\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nJason, AKA GrayTap, The Black Llama\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\"><ul><li>Edit 1<ul><li>Here are the bz2 files for those that would like them!</li><li><a href=\"http://www.graytap.com/index.php?module=Downloads;sa=dlview;id=35\">fy_taboo_beta_bz2.zip</a></li></ul></li><li><font color=\"red\">Edit 2<ul><li>Here is a random spawn file for CSS: DM/SourceMod!<br />58 spawn points!!!<br />Enough to disorientate anyone!!!</li><li><a href=\"http://www.graytap.com/index.php?module=Downloads;sa=dlview;id=36\">fy_taboo_beta_cssdm_ran_spawn.zip</a></li></ul></li></ul></font>"
