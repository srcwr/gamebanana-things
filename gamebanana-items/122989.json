I figure there may still be some fun left in this map for others.\r\n\r\n-PULLED FROM README MADE 2 YEARS AGO-\r\n\r\nSurf_Skyworld_Fire\r\n\r\nThe Orignal maker of \"Surf_Skyworld\" is unknown.\r\nI (Olaf \"ClanFever\" Flesch) have made this map. The things I have done are:\r\nSmoothen ramps\r\nMake a hole in the triangle with a buyzone in the middle\r\nA sun, and proper lighting\r\nTMP's and M4's at bottom of surf.\r\nA whole retexture\r\nOptimizations\r\nFire replaces brokensurf, and \"Clan Fever\" above spawn.\r\n\r\nThis request was made by Fire.\r\n\r\nKnown Errors:\r\nHammer hates us all, and it has decided two surf plates shouldn't be even. This should not affect your surfing."
