	"_sText": "This is a map with 6 hidden teleports behind boxes that break. It has two long skinny basements and two long wall slots, but best is the two launchers that literally launch people to the other side of the map. Plus, two of the portals lead up to the sky sniping spots. but no worry to get down all you need to do is jump into the water. the map made some of my members lag so i changed the water to \"cheap\" water but if i get requests for \"expensive\" water i will upload that.
