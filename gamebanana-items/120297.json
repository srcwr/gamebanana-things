	"_sText": "Just a new breakfloor map with earths layers insted of glass blocks if you break them all you fall into the earths core :). Made this map to fix some problems like spawn camping and flashes over the wall a sound will go off if someone is spawn camping after 30 seconds into the round to let everyone know someone is up there, works well with rpg mods because you cant survive the fall even with 500+ life."
