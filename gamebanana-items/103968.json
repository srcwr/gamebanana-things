	"_sText": "Well, de_silica is a bomb defusal map for 32 players. It is my first attempt to make a map with dust theme, and probably the first decent map I have made to Source engine.\r\n\r\nThe map is almost ready, but I will upload a beta version soon. Suggestions and comments, even based on the screenshots, are welcome.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, forgot to mention.. There is a tunnel network below the ground, I'll add at least one more exit after Hammer finishes compiling."
