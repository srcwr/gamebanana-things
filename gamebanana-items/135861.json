Overall time spent on it was about 12 hours across 2 days. Tried looking at different curving techniques, which i liked with mixed results and overall i think the map plays good and has alot to keep players interested.\r\n\r\nDev textures from FPSBanana http://www.fpsbanana.com/ by Chris528. Thanks for the textures.\r\n\r\nCustom Textures added with Pakrat.\r\n\r\nSpawn Points: 32\r\n"
