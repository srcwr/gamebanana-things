When releasing it, I decided to rush it's completion and I left it at a state that after all these years, I'm still unhappy with. I've been planning on making a remake of this but in the mean time, I've decided to give the original map the polish and care it deserved back then, and I hope to do the same for all future works of mine.<br><br>This new 2024 update includes a buncha goodies such as a working radar and better visibility! All the changes are documented in the changelog, so make sure to look at that!<br><br>The original 2019 version will still be available for download. I hope you enjoy this new version!<br>"
