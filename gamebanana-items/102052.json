I know this theme has been done before, but i hope i that once i add to this map it will be unique and creative. Please for my future reference please provide suggestions to what i can add to the map to make it more along the lines of an AIM or texture map, and i know this will never be a TRUE AIM map b/c I'm going to keep the bomb/defuse. Maybe if the i convert this map good enough into a texture map I'll take away the bomb/defuse aspect. \r\n\r\nThanks"
