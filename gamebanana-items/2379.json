In addition, since I made this prefab for someone else and do not personally own CS:S, the ladder doesn't actually work. If you use it, simply tie the actual ladder to a func_ladder before you run it in-game.\r\n\r\nLastly, if you use it, please let me know at the very least. Credit is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThat is all."
