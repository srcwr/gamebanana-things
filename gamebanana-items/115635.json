The last thing you remember was being knocked over the head HARD.  You awake in a dark room with only a pistol and a knife...\r\n\r\nBasically, this map is one big puzzle/race. =)\r\nThe puzzles are challenging, but not super hard, so everyone can solve them.\r\n\r\nThe puzzles are as follows:\r\n1st room: a lightswitch and a dark room, and a door\r\n\r\n2nd room: a locked door with a keypad\r\n\r\n3rd room: 7 teleports... pick the right one, or you might face certain death ;)\r\n\r\n4th room: Completely WHITE room, with a door hidden... somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe 5th and last room: A buyzone and a teleport to the other team's spawn...you know... to sneak up on them from behind ;)\r\n\r\nSo you want to be the team to get through the puzzle first and get to the other team and slaughter em :P  \r\n\r\nHave fun =)\r\n\r\n**If you find any bugs/glitches be sure to let me know, and yes I did already do a test on the map.**\r\n\r\nThanks =P\r\n\r\n\r\n"
