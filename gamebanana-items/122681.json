When the map is completed the timer will be disabled. The player that has finished the map receives a machine gun and low gravity. The choice is his to either rape face or leave the others to practice.\n\nsurf_orbion X is the timerless version. This map has been optimized for servers that use a timerscript and therefore do not need an endjail.\n\nMany, many thanks to the mappers for creating their stages. The result is amazing. Thanks guys!\n\nVideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEK6DNSy-hQ&amp;hd=1"
