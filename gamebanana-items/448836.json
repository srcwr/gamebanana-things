	"_sText": "The map contains 4 stages based on movies (5th last one planned). It is also divided into 2 modes:<br><br><b>Easy Mode:</b> Default settings the maps starts with. The 4 main stages are playable, some of holds are simpler, the layout is generally intuitive and doesn't necessarily require a leader. Some of the traps are modified or removed. There are also 2 items available to assist humans. This should make the map playable during normal hours.<br><br><b>Escape Mode:</b>&nbsp;The layout is the same, however stages would get locked upon completion. Holds are more challenging and the map requires a leader and good player base. The human items are also disabled (although they can be easily added with a stripper). Once the main 4 stages are completed, the last one would be unlocked (that's the idea).&nbsp;<br><br>Escape Mode can be activated by shooting the trigger box in the spawn area, or from the admin room. The trigger scales with the player base and requires at least 20 active players.&nbsp;<br><br>The main stages are based on the following movies:<br>&nbsp;- \"Willy's Wonderland\" (2021)<br>&nbsp;- \"As above, So Below\" (2014)<br>&nbsp;- \"Harry Potter\" (years 2, 3)<br>&nbsp;- \"Sphere\" (1998)<br><br>There are also some other movie references:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrWkLOneHqMPD0uOdY2YATVZqEaUObmy<br><br>Each stage is about 9-10 minutes. There are also NPC-s and zombie items. Thanks to the GFL and Nide communities for testing and suggestions. There is entwatch and bhud included in the archive (tested on Nide)<br><br>Good luck!"
