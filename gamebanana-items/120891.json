Every 15 seconds, one terrorist, in the middle box, is let out of the cage, as a ghost with a knife, to attack the counter-terrorists who are defenseless. The goal of the Ts is to kill all of the CTs. The goal of the CTs is to destroy all of the \"yellow squares\" put strategically around the map, by pressing up against them. When all 168 \"yellow squares\" are destroyed, all  players CT and T are killed, the round ends and CTs get 10 points. Enjoy."
