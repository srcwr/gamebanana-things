	"_sText": "<hr /><b>Details:</b><br />\r\nWell, here is my remake of Halo 2's Zanzibar. After sitting on this map for months trying to fix the problems with it, i have given up lol. Since so many ppl kept spamming me with requests to finish it (you know who you are), i decided to just release it as is and be done with it. i may recompile it in the future, so feel free to make suggestions <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/wips/30411\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nKnown problems: 1 Bad CT spawn, very open and somewhat empty, shadow issues on 3 prob_dynamics, dead water, a few black textures, 1 compile glitch (stairs, t spawn)\r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b><br />\r\n40 spawns, working turrets, spawned weapons and grenades scattered around the map, hidden specialty weapons, buyzones.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />Please visit <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/studios/2377\">Clan 5k3's studio</a> for more Halo css maps and materials."
