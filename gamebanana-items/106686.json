	"_sText": "This is simple map that is made of 9 romms interconected in a 3x3 form, like a computer's numpad. It's 1vs1, so only 2 players can play at the same time, CT is spawned in the 9th romm and the T is spawned in t 1st room. No light are made on the map, so it's preferable to enable the flashlight.\r\nThe \"fun\" fact of this map is the lack of lights, which makes it harder and even scarier xD. In the updated version both players start wit a deagle and a knife.\r\n\r\nThere is a new up to 4vs4 players version here: http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/156557"
