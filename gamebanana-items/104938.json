If you have *constructive* comments, feel free to post one.\r\n\r\nIf you have dumb comments, don't post it. Just remember I've done the map all by myself (expect props/materials from other people), and with very few help (80% of the forum pals tells you \"google it\"...).\r\n\r\nIf you feel you can do better, I've included the *.vmf, so feel free to make your own version ;).\r\n"
