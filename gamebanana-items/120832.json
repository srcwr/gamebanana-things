	"_sText": "This is fun map I made. You spawn with just a TMP and Knives in a dust like area. Theres the outside open shootout level and the underground dark level. Theres also a grenade in the middle to make everyone rush for it. And a campfire in the middle of the underground level, shoot at it to light it up.\r\n\r\n2/26/07 - I will be working on a newer more optimized version and overall better looking version of this map. This was one of my first maps and I look back on it today seeing how bad it was and lacking in details. Expect a new release. "
