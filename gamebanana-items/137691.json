	"_sText": "This is the second version of an older map of mine entitled <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/163568\">surf_library</a>. <br><br>It has many secrets in it for the player to find. Most of them include getting special weapons, like the previous version. There is also a teleport to a hidden buy zone, a place to choose any weapon of your choice.<br><br>The main difference of this map for the previous one (hence the 2 after its name) is because of the extra room I added right below the wall clock. Now it shows a broken wall, and beyond it there's a corridor with a single ramp that can boost the player through a deadly challenge. <br>When beaten, the end of this corridor might lead to some cool features! :)<br><br>For more information, please refer to the older version of the map, in the link mentioned above :) Also watch the video, because many of the secrets weren't changed!<br><br>Happy surfing!<br>"
