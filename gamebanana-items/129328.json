	"_sText": "This map is an edited version of the ba_jail_electric_large jail break map.  I have added light to it which makes it look better (in my opinion).  I have also created more secret spots in this map which I think makes game play much more enjoyable.  A big thing I have done in this map was create 2 mini games.  One is a race where the first person to press the button at the end kills the rest of the T's and gets last request.  The other one is a jump rope game where when you touch the bar you will get teleported to a small cage where the ct's could let you go free or shock you to your death.\r\n\r\nPlease rate and comment I want to know what you guys think.  This is my first time editing a map and I want to get better at it."
