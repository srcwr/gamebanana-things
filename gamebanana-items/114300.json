	"_sText": "This is the final edition of \"fy_smig\", the map only uses MP5's along with Scouts, and is pretty fast paced. There are two routes, one that leads to the main portion and one that leads to the out-lying tunnels and rooms, from the symmetrical bases. The first route, to the middle, is pretty straight forward. There are a couple of boxes, but it's pretty close, there is also a ladder to the top of each base. The second route leads to a tunnel which wraps around the map with a large room on either end behind the bases. The positioning of these doors, each being closer to the back rooms of their respective bases, means that you can either rush the opposite room, through the narrow and sparsely-covered tunnels, or get a jump on the enemy in your own base. In addition to these two routes are two canopies on opposite sides of the middle, which you can access through ladders in the tunnels. This map also uses a couple pastel textures I made, all of them are this style accept for the water. Enjoy!"
