THIS OUGHT TO BE THE FINAL VERSION\r\n\r\n**UPDATE AND NON-BETA:I have now made several changes to improve the map. I made a new jail from scratch(old one sucked) and made several small changes/improvements.\r\nThere's a secret nade in every stage now, go find them :)\r\n\r\nStarted at this map in December '08.\r\nIt is now bug-free(hopefully)! I hope you enjoy it.\r\nThe map consists of 5 stages and a jail.\r\n\r\nThe map was intended to be a pro surf map, and you've got 6 minutes to surf it before getting teleported to jail. The player(s) who surfed longest get weapons. If you complete it, some fancy slay methods become available.\r\n\r\n*NOBLOCK IS REQUIRED\r\n\r\nNEW VIDEO BY HELLRAISEDSURFER AND NITRO!
