	"_sText": "This is an arena out in the middle of no where. Competive teams teleport from the ships to the arena and commense battle. The teams are locked in the teleport room which has an afk/camper fail-safe system. The glass is a special high density glass that does not crack or shatter due to bullet strike, uneven pressure, and subzero temperatures. The floor has the latest artifical gravity technology giving earth-like gravity evenly over the etire surface. This might make an okay place for a death match; however the fail-safe system will still activate, although it will only do so once. Please enjoy this enjoy this map, and dont forget your vaccume suits. :P\r\n\r\nPlease see the README for additional information about the sky textures"
