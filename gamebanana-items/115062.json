	"_sText": "This map has been in production for some time now. almost 12 months since its conception. \r\n\r\nWith the need of my studio to have a map that they could call their own i created this on a whim. \r\n\r\nCreed is a mixture of ground fighting with a flare of light from my personal lights rad file. light emitting textures.\r\n\r\nthe layout is in the traditional, buy zone in its center but no guns at spawn for those that want to use the gun game feature. \r\n\r\nlight effects and models are used for most of the eye candy. i have added occluder brushwork to help the f-rates, hint brush work to help the compile time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must thank Ramaq for continuous ideas. and Lost, Sgt.kickurass for the help in the time it took me to complete this release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map holds 16 per side. 32 max.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=''http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/projects/view/4225\">This is the Project for Creed</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n"
