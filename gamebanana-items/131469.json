	"_sText": "Since I've been unable to find the original Moo's b4 release of this fantastic map CBBLE, I decided to re-release it while adding a bit of eye candy.\r\n\r\n--version 4.5--\r\nSpecific changes include:\r\n\r\n- More optimization!! (Is that even possible?)\r\n- Tweaked lightning in interior zones\r\n- Added HDR for extra eye candy\r\n- Cubemaps for your everyday reflection\r\n- Environment changes such as new skymap, sun color, sun sprites...\r\n- Adjusted some spots a few inches to make them more challenging (specially the MOO place)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! Feel free to point out whatever you want."
