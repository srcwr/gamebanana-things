Over all I myself spent a week with a little over 100 hours into the map. 20 of those were me trying to figure out the custom soundscape which everyone should enjoy and learn from. It has sortof a HALO 2 feel to it if you've ever seen the video of \"CAPN SLAPAHO falls alseep\".\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><b><font color=\"cyan\">Features:</font></b></legend>\r\n<br />\r\ncustom soundscape<br />\r\n<br />\r\nhighly optimized/higher framerates<br />\r\n<br />\r\nlots of brush fixes/texture fixes/ladder perfectioning<br />\r\n<br />\r\n300+ beta testers<br />\r\n<br />\r\nwell over 1000 hours of testing amongst the players<br />\r\n<br />\r\nstill slightly ct sided<br />\r\n<br />\r\nincludes some very difficult moves while newer players can still play the old way<br />\r\n<br />\r\nnon-green radar's<br />\r\n<br />\r\nsame sky, but correct lighting leaving players more distinct and visible<br />\r\n<br />\r\nstandard texture map 1 blacklight :p<br />\r\n<br />\r\nyou decide how creative you can move throughtout the map<br />\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend><b><font color=\"cyan\">SPECIAL THANKS:</font></b></legend>\r\n<br />\r\nMoHax of course for putting all the pressure on the diamond, i just cut and polished it ;p<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 100's of testers sharing their ideas and dealing with the downloads (13gig of bandwidth in that week), about half said they'd wondered what it would have been like. I think i've done a good job. They also nicknamed it \"The Cabana\" :D<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSUPER SPECIAL thanks to <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/153908\">bigmach</a> for making me register cuz he took the map,named it mach_city,said someone else made it, forgot half the files, and posted it on fpsb :)<br />\r\n</fieldset>"
