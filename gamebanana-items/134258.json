	"_sText": "Gg_corkscrew, a uniquely shaped building with curved ramps leading up. Each floor has a set of ramps going the opposite way than the previous. A 3 story building with distinct features on each. Fit for even the most heavily populated servers with 36 slots. The main building is surrounded with blocks and little towers that can be used as sniper posts. Can also be used as ka, or just regular map because i included a buyzone. Please comment!"
