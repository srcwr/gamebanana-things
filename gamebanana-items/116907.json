All credit goes to him and Rareware for originally designing this level in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis DM Version has:\r\n\r\n- A Nav File\r\n- Spawn Text File\r\n- A Radar Map\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n\r\nPut the 007_facility_dm.bsp into cstrike/maps and put 007_facility_dm.txt into cstrike/cfg/cssdm/spawns to install the map.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThis map was made for Death Match, nothing else.  The default CT spawn area doesn't even have a buy zone, because you wouldn't need one in Death Match so don't complain about things like that.  If you have any other questions or comments though, please let me know.</font>"
