Quite a few things are still missing, but unfortunately the engine wouldn't allow any more detail. The map is quite well optimized. A couple things here and there could be done better. A lot of the restrictions of the engine limited what I could do...<br><br>Anyway, here is a new CSS ZM map for you all."
