I tried to make a map around a theme, that of a dungeon, and I think it turned out alright.&nbsp;<br><br>Also this map has some hard longjumps, the first 250 unit longjump can be skipped if you're fast enough.<br><br>Even though I would love to have a CS:GO port out today, the map is really dark for some reason and it won't be posted until that gets fixed. (Any help would be appreciated.)<br><br>Don't have CS:S? Get it for CS:GO <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/194483\">here</a>.<br><br>Posted on February 18, 2017."
