The map is a huge hill of breakable blocks where you can dig traps and tunnels.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't know who original mapper is, but I like his map and that's why I did this remake. I hope there will be more servers with gg-break-hillbreak or gg-break-hillfresh, because I  couldn't find one yesterday.\r\n\r\nAlso I provide no video today, only screenshots.\r\n\r\niPlayer, URC Team, 2012\r\n\r\n[Steam profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/its_iPlayer](http://steamcommunity.com/id/its_iPlayer \"http://steamcommunity.com/id/its_iPlayer\")"
