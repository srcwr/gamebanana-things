There are ramps connecting the upper areas of the towers to the center fort and hedges and other brushwork for cover on the ground. Custom textures by {cDS} winnebago_warrior.  This is my first attempt at creating custom textures and I am aware that they are.....cheesy =).  thanks to {cDS} peanuts and {cDS} The Black Rose for tips and pointers along the design path."
