	"_sText": "This is my third map release. I just threw this together semi-randomly, like all of my maps. This one has sort of an \"aztecish\" feel to it, and should be good and even. This map has 32 player support, though i have not tried it with 32 bots, because my computer cant handle it, so I dont know if it will be too crowded.\r\n\r\nThis map is made for the Gun Game mod, but can really be used for straight Deathmatch aswell because i have included buyzones.\r\n\r\nI have play tested it and it seemed to work fine, but if you have any issues, please let me know, so i can attempt to fix them.\r\n\r\nPlease provide *CONSTRUCTIVE* criticism.\r\n\r\nENJOY!"
