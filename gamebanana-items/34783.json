Besides there was a set of inaccuracies in connections of areas.\r\n\r\nI made this NAV at the request by [Tikal The Echidna](http://gamebanana.com/members/967635) (thanks for his interest). Personally this map not really is pleasant to me, but... if people play on it let play with the maximum pleasure! :-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   bloodsugarTW (for his diligence to make the good map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks ;-)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 04.03.2014**\r\n\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n- Improved movement through a window at second floor (near the Bombsite B);\r\n- Improved movement through a doorways (overall);\r\n- Some other minor improvements.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!**"
