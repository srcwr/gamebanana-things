I took my previous map, gg_chapel, and fixed some of the mistakes I made as well as added two bombsites. Change log is in the DevNotes.\r\n\r\nThe map's theme is a small European chapel that gets invaded by Terrorists. It's a very beautiful and fun map to play on.\r\n\r\nIncludes a level overview/radar image, opening level text, and an edited *.nav file so that bots don't get stuck and places in the map have names recognized by the game.\r\n\r\nPlease download and tell me any suggestions! Thank you!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed missing texture and radar not showing up. Enjoy!"
