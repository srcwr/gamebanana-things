	"_sText": "This map is a re-upload of my original Dogz Arena 2 map.  I got tired of having to fix and edit the same file over and over and I'm sure it was confusing a lot of servers because i kept the same name which was fucking around with compatibility and so forth.\r\n\r\nAs such, I've tweaked it one last time.  all the textures are properly packed, all the problems have been solved.  Everything I can do has been done to make this the pristine, final edition of this map.  Sorry for all the confusion.\r\n\r\nI urge those who've downloaded this map as the old version to remove and delete that file and add this version to their map list and servers.  Anyone who plays it will re-down load this do to the name change as steam will recognize it as a brand new map.\r\n\r\nThank you, guys, for all your tips, comment, and support in making this map as it was my first, and inspired me to continue making maps.  I hope to entertain you guys with fresh ideas in the future.\r\n\r\nWith that, I bring you the new, fully fuctional, completed, and (so I've been told \"bad-ass-ier\") version: gg_dogz_arena_ver2\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\n\r\nBailey"
