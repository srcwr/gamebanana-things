	"_sText": "Hey! This is my first map I've ever made and I worked hard on it. I designed it for sniper and ground battles, since I like both, and I added some neat lighting to make it feel like it's morning. No music/ambient sounds yet, but I might include that in V2. if anyone can show me how, please PM me. Also thanks to 3kliksphilip for his awesome tutorial to help me make my first map.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n\r\n-Some parts of the map are messed up/floating (will fix)\r\n-Bots commit suicide a lot (will try to fix)\r\n-Ladder's width is too much (easy to fix)\r\n\r\nConstructive critism is welcomed"
