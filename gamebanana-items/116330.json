Hang out, takes some pictures, and enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis map is built from the ground up to show what kind of graphics the episode 1 source engine is capable of. Centered around a long section of highway based on real locations in California mountain ranges, there is plenty here to see.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this map IS NOT INTENDED FOR GAMEPLAY. While I've included spawns and buyzones, the map is not designed for balanced play. (Although, I could see a few of snipers having some fun maybe)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<fieldset><font size=\"4\">Features</font></fieldset>\r\n<ul><li>dozens of new models and textures\r\n<li>huge size\r\n<li>NAV file\r\n<li>custom content zipped to the bsp.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAll custom content is made by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/103053\">Dr. Spud</a> and may not be re-used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>More by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/103053\">Dr. Spud</a></legend>\r\nCheck out my bomb/defuse map,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/28393\"><font size=\"4\">de_glacier</font></a>\r\n\r\nFor a casual fight yard map, check out\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/75639\"><font size=\"4\">fy_highrise_09</font></a>\r\n\r\nAnd for another fight yard map, try my remake of fy_snow,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/31363\"><font size=\"4\">fy_snow_07</font></a>\r\n\r\n</fieldset>"
