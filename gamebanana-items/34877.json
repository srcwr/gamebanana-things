How transient meetings with them in back alleys! :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original mapauthor's .nav-file included in archive with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/113280).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks. ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Hakk1tus (for excellent misty and stelth-friendly map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nHow long the night is - why is this passage so narrow?\r\nHow strange my body feels, impaled upon the arrow.\r\n\r\n:-)"
