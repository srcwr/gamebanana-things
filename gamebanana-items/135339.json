	"_sText": "This is my first counter strike source map. I hope you like it. It is basically a remixed iceworld with a 3d skybox and a bit of finish and detail put into the map such as some nice ambient sounds, lighting, and fog. \r\n\r\n36 player spawns with high narrow passages make it feel a little claustrophobic (purposely) and give people who like to knife some good opportunities. Almost all spots on the map have 3 points to cover making it difficult to camp too."
