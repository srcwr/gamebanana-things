Progress dropped as soon as the deadline hit in January 2019. 7 months after that, I took over using the files I had in order to uphold the promise made to the mappers that their work would be released.<br><br>This work is released with <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/1b9022e0a112a5e6899b8dbee7f6ae90\" target=\"_blank\">the permission of Krazy</a> (the lead host).<br><br>Lastly, I'd like to say sorry to the people who's work didn't actually make it. The LSD bonus made by 111112oo had to be removed due to genuine safety concerns and iNooVa made a stage which didn't make it due to late submission and the map being at 96% limits.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who participated and worked on this. On behalf of the hosts; sorry it took so long.<br><br>If you would like to port this to CS:GO/TF2, add me on Discord (pretzL#0001) and I'll give you the files.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9Difx3pFZw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
