	"_sText": "This is my second map. I hope you guys like it.\r\nIt is a map with close battles. The T's can either choose to camp behind a corner or run for a better weapon. The counter-terrorist can choose to stay high and keep the T low, or enter the secret tunnel in ct spawn. If a player wants a good weapon he has to take a big risk, because you have to go to spots where you can get easily killed. Also, T's can get a scout, however, they are likely to get killed by nades if they get there.\r\nI really tried a lot of different ways to keep the t vs ct fair and let them take risks for better weapons or hide with a weaker one."
