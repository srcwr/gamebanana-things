	"_sText": "This is a training map that was made for my clan upon request.  There are four areas of the map:\r\n\r\n1st: A basic area for knifing\r\n2nd: A maze intended for using sound and little light to find opponents.\r\n3rd: A balancing platform for more knife practice.\r\n4th: The large building which is intended for one on one gun fights.  There are buyzones in the building (Counter-Terrorists to the left, Terrorists to the right).\r\n\r\nThere are only two spawns due to the style and layout of the map, so is intended for improving skills for one on one combat.\r\n\r\nThe map has HDR lighting available as well and a 3d skybox for better scenery.\r\n\r\nWell I hope you enjoy the map."
