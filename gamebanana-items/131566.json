Anyone wishing to play on the map before downloading it should either contact me by xfire at natalyaaf to set something up, or to simply go to this server, where the map is in rotation:\r\n\r\nN/U's Zombie Mod Server\r\n74.86.102.230:27015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant:\r\nSome people on said server reported that a lot of textures are missing.  Now, the textures are paked into the map, but if for some reason you don't get all the custom textures, I've created <a href=\"http://www.Aura-Forums.com/natty/materials.zip\">this</a> pack of textures used in the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's about it...  Feel free to leave any questions or comments!!\r\nNatalya[AF]</font>"
