	"_sText": "Surf_infinity is a combat/freestyle surf map designed with fast paced ramp combat in mind.\r\n\r\nThis was designed and tested on 66 tic and 150 airaccelerate, though should be fine on other settings due to it being a combat map.  This map was not designed specifically for deathmatch, but it should be great for it.\r\n\r\nmap created by Rscar\r\nskybox by Shini\r\n\r\nThanks to all those who helped test and to paper cut and other solid surf members for advice.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)"
