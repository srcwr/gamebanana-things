	"_sText": "This is a fun, short, basic map that takes place during snowfall.  Players have no body armor to give more of a \"Real Damage\" feel to the map which allows for quicker game-play.  Grenades lay in the trenches on both sides.  A cat-walk runs across the middle with 2 AWPs at each end.  Get the AWP and if your team wins, keep it next round and dominate!  Choke point is in the middle because for each side, there's only one way up the cat walk so beware.  Of course, anyone can walk underneath the cat walk to the other side and hide behind boxes and posts as well.  I've only played this with bots and it flows pretty well.  Can't wait to play it with real people!  Enjoy!  "
