	"_sText": "Simple Glass map that isn't to visually impressive, but tons of fun to play. Testing it was a bast. Consists of two houses constructed completely of pressure sensitive glass, along with the floor below. There are steel supports for the glass allowing the player to have some mobility after all the glass is broken, below that is a pit where everyone dies....\r\n\r\nYou are allowed a knife and a P228 Compact Pistol in this map, nothing else. In the middle is a concrete and bullet proof maze leading to two kill switches. Each button demolishes one of the houses in the map potentially ending the game as it kills everyone inside. It may be a little CPU intensive, but the lag subsides quite quickly on older systems. The roof collapses crushing everything below it....\r\n\r\n<div><b>Author:</b> Silent Ricochet\r\n<b>Beta Testing and Support:</b> Specialist</div>"
