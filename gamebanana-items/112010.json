	"_sText": "    This map is my first full Counter-Strike: Source map. I'm mainly a single player Half-Life 2 mapper, but I decided to make a css map. I feel I was pretty successfully. My friends and I had a lot of fun playing it, and still do, and I hope you do too. Please excuse the bad texture alignment and low detail in some areas, I haven't mapped in a while. Concentrate more on the actual game play itself.\r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\nBuilding that can be entered, and has a sniper spot. \r\nThunder storm with randomized thunder and lightning.\r\nBig layout.\r\nVery fun with 20+ players/bots.\r\nDark night time atmosphere. \r\n\r\n"
