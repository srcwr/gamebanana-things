There are some new areas to go into. Models are everywere in the map. New ladders, peak hole for ct team, new bunkers, scouts are now laying on the ground for more ammo, new cage lights, better places to hide, bots fully work in the map, Trains and elevators were going to be added but they dont work in the map becouse of player lag."
