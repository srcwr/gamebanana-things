After a run in with the forgotten tenures in the end, this cancer is <i>back</i> and <i>worse</i> than ever. This map was made to be a joke and should be taken in no way seriously. This map is possible though, if you watch the video above, you will see me doing the map in 1:36, which is definitely improvable, but I wanted to get a \"walk-through\" out. This map took about 6 hours to make, across two days.<br><br><i><a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/197643\">PART II </a>OUT NOW!!!</i><br><br>Re-Uploaded November 6, 2016.<br>Updated description November 6, 2017."
