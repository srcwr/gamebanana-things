Cts spawn outside, Ts spawn inside - a little like cs_assault\r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\nThis is my first map and I am aware of one glitch with the hostages - they don't follow you out of one of the doors, if anyone can help It would be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nI have since noticed a few glitches and Chizbone shed light on some too so I'm fixing those at the moment.\r\n\r\nI put heaps of effort into this map - I hope you enjoy it"
