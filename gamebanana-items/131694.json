	"_sText": "Ever feel like your zombie server could use a little change up?  This map is a visual breath of fresh air.  Plenty of camping spots all over the map to explore and try out.  No impenetrable spots (like 1 way tunnels with couches nearby), but plenty of difficult to attack spots.  It's a good sized map, but not too large or elongated, which tends to separate the action.  It's pretty open, so you should have a good amount of zombies in your view to shoot at and keep from getting bored.\r\n\r\n*** BETA VERSION 2 ***\r\n\r\nComplete rework, and improvements to some of the spots thanks to Robin.  This newer version is much better, almost every spot has been reworked to balance it out.  Please send constructive suggestions for improvements, I will work everything into Beta 3."
