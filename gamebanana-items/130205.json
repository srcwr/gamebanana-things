	"_sText": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInspired by Lila's addictive map, zm_lila_panic, I have come across of the thought of remaking it.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know there are many remakes out there, but I wanted to test out my skills on remaking it. New textures and bug fixes will be added on the next version!\r\n\r\nCREDITS ARE AT THE BOTTOM!\r\n\r\nEven though its textures were not changed, (yet) I have added many things:\r\n-Lighting \r\n-More props\r\n-Decals (graffiti, blood)\r\n-Secret room\r\n-More realistic\r\n-More fun!\r\nI have blocked some parts of the map to prevent \"vent camping\", such as the cement cylinders. \r\n\r\nEven though the textures aren't that great, upon request, I will make a new version with good textures!\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nSparta (a.k.a timmysdf) - Remaking the map\r\nLila - Making the original map\r\n\r\nOther credits:\r\n\r\n3kliksphilip - Awesome tutorials\r\n\r\nI AM THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THIS REMAKE! Don't believe the others who say that it's theirs!\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
