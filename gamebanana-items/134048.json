This map took the better part of three weeks to complete, but I've learned a lot in that short time (figuring out how to embed images into the bsp took a while hehe). I tried to focus on dynamics. That is, a fair amount of cover while retaining multiple access points across the map. Maybe I just read too far into it. Either way, here it is."
