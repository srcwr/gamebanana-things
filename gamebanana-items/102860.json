	"_sText": "This map takes place in a Russian naval submarine station in some god forsaken place. The Terrorists begin just inside the compound and must make their way through the frozen barracks and storage areas to reach their targests. Both targets are Submarines. One is in a drydock while the other is in a pen in the water. The bombsites are parallel to each other and relatively close. Even with their close proximity, reaching either of the bomb sites can be a chore if the Counter-Terrorists create a proper defense. Barrels, crates and ammunition lockers give excellent cover to the defenders. The bomb sites are in open areas, so long range weapons will be important for anyone attacking/defending them. The quality of the map is great, the effects that give the heat generators their blurring effect hint to the player that is it very cold at the base, even though that is one of senses that is absent in the video game experience. The interiors give the impression that the facility is a barren outpost. Lots of contrete, tile, fogged glass and dim lighting set the stage for this map, which by the way, can hold up to 64 players. For a map this size, the battles could be insane with that many players.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: yellow; font-size: xx-Small\">Review by Milkman.</p>"
