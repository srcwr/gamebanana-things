	"_sText": "This map is similar to fy_iceworld except with a few changes.  There are reloading catapults that launch exploding watermelons across the map, along with a watermelon dropper on the tops of 4 center columns in the map.\r\n\r\nThere is a buyzone in the middle, over some breakable ice that covers an underwater tunnel.\r\n\r\nI recommend using sv_turbophysics \"1\" so you can push the melons around. (Especially at the top, you can push them off in any direction with turbo physics.)"
