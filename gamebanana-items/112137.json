This is one i made in about 1 hour its simple, but you have no weapons, and theres two sides, one for the T's and for CT's. People cannot cross over the line but the grenades can!\r\n\r\nEnjoy This Map (Lots more coming)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/dodgemod - Download Kit Kat's Dodgemod (Highly Recommended.)\r\n\r\nhttp://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/NadeTrail - Download Nadetrails (Very useful for some nice effects on your grenades.)\r\n\r\nhttp://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/DeathSounds - Really Fun To Have While dodgemod (funny death sounds when you die =D)"
