The map alternates the player between two timelines, and it includes a lot of rarely seen features in Source Engine maps, like moving clouds, dynamically changing skybox, color correction and expensive water on more than one Z axis at once.&nbsp;The map was made for a KSF mapping contest, where it has not won any prizes, but got an honorable mention. As a note from me, I started working on the map around 3 weeks before the contest's deadline, so I unfortunately did not have the time to polish the map and it feels unfinished to me, but I had&nbsp;no&nbsp;other&nbsp;choice than to release it - I hope you enjoy playing it anyway :)<br><br><b>FOR SERVER OWNERS:</b><br>- designed for <span class=\"GreenColor\">66/64</span> tickrate, <span class=\"GreenColor\">150</span> sv_airaccelerate, <span class=\"GreenColor\">5000</span> sv_maxvelocity<br>- in order for all of the map features to work properly, do <span class=\"RedColor\">NOT</span> remove any entities using plugins like stripper etc. on your server<br><b><br>FOR PLAYERS:</b><br>- client-side, make sure HDR and color correction are enabled and mat_specular is 1<br>- if the map appears too dark in some parts, I recommend raising the brightness settings, and if that doesn't help, in worst case you can also disable HDR which will make the map way brighter (but also uglier)"
