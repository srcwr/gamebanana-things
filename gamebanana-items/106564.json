My first map actually.\r\nIt took me a few days to finish the map.\r\nThis map provides room for 2 to 24 players, there are several ways to get into the opponents fort.\r\nWhen you spawn you can choose ak-47 or m4a1, if you wont die your weapons will be kept.\r\nThere's an awp on the roof which is a bit tricky to grab.\r\nEach fort got a door which can only be opened from inside.\r\n\r\n***Changes with vers. 1.1***\r\nThe lamps inside are now gray/white colored.\r\nBoxes have been added to the roof.\r\nThe windows on the first floor are now bigger.\r\nFixed the textures.\r\nThe button which open the door have now been moved to the center where the guns are located.\r\nThe fire have been moved from the bridge to pillars in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest version is here:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/56742"
