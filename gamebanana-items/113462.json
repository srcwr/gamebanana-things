	"_sText": "The idea is the same as fy_iceworld but this is set indoors, inside of an office building. There are some filing cabinets and other misc objects placed around the map to give the players something a little different from the original and MANY other fy_iceworld style maps. There was only one hostage killed, and he was then hung from his waist from the ceiling right in the center of the map... There is also a few hidden secrets in the map, one of which is the -=]619[=- clan tag windows on the ceiling, the other I will just say \"start left›look up›spray-n-pray\""
