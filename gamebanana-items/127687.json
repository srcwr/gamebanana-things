[This is not working on cs:s i wish some day someone make a port so we can dance in cs:s<br><br>Info about the weight:<br><br>239MB this means if you will upload this map to a webhost (for fast download in a public server) remember to not compress the map to bz2 because the csgo/css limit is 150mb and your clients will not download the map.<br></span><span class=\"GreenColor SelectedElement\"><span class=\"RedColor\"><br></span><span class=\"RedColor\">About the CS:S Version:<br>this version has some small changes to adapt to cs: s.</span></span><br>"
