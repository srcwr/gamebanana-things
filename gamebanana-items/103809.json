The townspeople are very proud of the town's Egyptian heritage.  There is great history here.  \r\n\r\nThe people work very hard to keep the town's structure solid, even though they realize their demise is soon - whether it be from the impending doom of the slowly moving sanddune, or the unending war which damages the city streets.  \r\n                                          \r\n\r\nTerrorists are an evil kind, and willingly destroy sections of the town, even bomb limestone blocks that the city dwellers \r\nuse to try to rebuild their homes and walls.\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nSpecial Map Note:  qUiCkSiLvEr spent many hours preparing the NAV file for this map, and re-textured the clouds so they would look like sand blowing across the sky. He also spent a great deal of time working the sounds through the map.  His work is, as always, superb, and I want to thank him for all he did for the success of this map.\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\nCONSTRUCTION:\r\n\r\nbase map:     \t\tNone          \t\t \r\neditor used:            Worldcraft 4.0 Hammer\r\nutilities used:        \tnone\r\nknown bugs:            \tnone\r\ncompile machine:    \tAMD Athlon 64x2 Dual  5600+ Core Processor\r\n\t\t\t3.12 Ghz  2.00 GB of Ram\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nRun Winzip and unzip de_Sandstorm.zip \r\nPlace the de_Sandstorm.bsp, de_Sandstorm.txt and de_Sandstorm.nav files in:  \r\nC:\\Valve\\Steam\\SteamApps\\email\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\nOTHER LEVELS BY DOCROCK:\r\n\r\nplease refer to my webpage for all of my maps\r\nhttp://docrocksmaps.homestead.com/docmaps.html\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\nBETA TESTERS:\r\n\r\nbabykitkat\r\nqUiCkSiLvEr\r\nSilly\r\nSuZi-Q\r\n[WAM]Olrik\r\nDarth Sailor\r\nsubzit\r\n[FF]Assn.BtK,.:|K2L|:.mike007\r\nAxel\r\nS?lentRunner007Â®\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n- babykitkat -\r\nfor everything!
