I was going to create level 4 & 5 but i had ran out of ideas + tried to keep orignal with the surfing. Alot of people told me to add a jail system in the map so there would be a time limit so i chucked in a random jail. Also level 2, the skybox is a bit dodgy as you can see through the wall on 1 side LOL! :) Hope you like my map\r\n\r\nVideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm-Q-ACow9I"
