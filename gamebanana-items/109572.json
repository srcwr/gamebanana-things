	"_sText": "An awesome map for any number of players, a hidden gun bonus on each side of the map to make it a bit fair, shoot through the middle wall to get to the enemies side faster but watch out because there may be a camper watching you from one of the 2 towers on each side, the towers are spacious enough to have a bunch of people in them and then they also have a balcony/bridge thing with a glass shield that will take some of the damage away from the shots being fired at you if that is what you need. 2 pools (mainly for aesthetic reasons =D) that you can jump into from the tower bridges so you dont get hurt.\r\n\r\neven if you disable weapons and just want to have a knife fight, this map will be a great choice\r\n\r\n\r\nhappy gaming and happy new year!\r\n , copenicaz"
