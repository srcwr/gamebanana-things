	"_sText": "This is my first map, and is alright I think. The detail isn't too great but it is just a Beta, and the gameplay is really good. There are many different passageways, and lots of different strategies to use. The bridge down the middle can be quick escape, but there is no cover from many sniping spots. Sometimes the games can last quite a while with all the different routes (especially if the bots get stuck in the water). There are two ladders to get out of the water on the wall of the little  platforms that stick out from the side, and another two vines to climb up on closer to the center (all vines are climable on this map). The hostage rescue point is the top floor of the side that the Counter-Terrorists spawn on. That rope like thing is also climable, but the AI seems to just disregard it. Overall it is a great map for medium/large size groups."
