	"_sText": " I'm finally mapping for Source again! This is probably my first source map in like, 2 years. It's a simple, COD4 inspired map I made to just fool around in, nothing to extravagant. I had to do a lot of re-compiling before this release.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I would have put HDR in, but every time I tried, the map would look <b>terrible</b> (Yes, I built my cubemaps. Once with HR on, and once with HDR off). So, I guess I'll just have to put HDR in my next releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.nav, .bsp and .txt are packaged in the <b>rar</b> file. Also, cubemaps are built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny issues, please tell me about. These can range from visual blemishes, to gameplay issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun."
