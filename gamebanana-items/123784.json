	"_sText": "Ok ya'll, I finally finished my long awaited xc_ratrace, I fixed all the textures so it would fit the map. There are no leaks/errors at all, everything has been tested and looked over by 3 different people and none of them could find any errors at all!\r\n\r\nIncludes textures and .wav files in the .bsp so you don't need to download all that crap and figure out where to put it. Just put the .bsp in the maps folder and you are all set. Isn't it nice how I just helped many souls out in the world to get this map?\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\nThere are now just CT spawns so you can play it 24/7 even if you die, no round time to wait just play fun fun fun! Also the teleporters are fixed to go to the right destination and if you fall on level four you won't be teleported back to level 1, you will be back at level 3 so you won't get that mad.\r\n\r\nThanks to -=][-][=- for testing the map.\r\n\r\nThanks to Eraser for helping me figure out how to get custom textures in it to pimp it out.\r\n\r\nThanks to all servers hosting it and making it a success.\r\n\r\nThanks to CSB for allowing my map to be published, I hope ya'll enjoy it!\r\n\r\n~JP~"
