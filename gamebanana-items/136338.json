This is a simple map intended for fast gameplay and fast rounds.\r\n\r\nYou can jump from almost every part of the map without damage so you can do your favourite Ninja attacks from the sky :D\r\n\r\nPlease download and access. \r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nEDIT: added the nav file by Chizbone, thanks mate ;)\r\n\r\n"
