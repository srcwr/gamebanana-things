There are no known bugs, fps stands around 100+ with 12 people (hasn't been tested with more than 12, but fps shouldnt drop more then 10-20 at max), sounds that loop every round, added details, the missile is now a physics object, improved explosion look (with fires and extra explosions, and a very even map.\r\n\r\nIf you want to check that map's final version out before adding it to your server, it will be on theserverspot.com's server #1 in a couple days. Simple map, awsome textures, and one hell of a killer time.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to {WTF}Kinky who helped with the phyisics missile and a big thanks to {WTF}< niT > who did all the optimization. Some of the custom textures were found on thewadfather.com and aother big thanks to whoever originally made them =P."
