This is my first attempt at a zombie map, and my first completed map overall.\r\n\r\nAny comments are appreciated.\r\nAlso, if you like the cabin itself, you're free to use it in any map.  It can be found without an elevator <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/503\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n04/27/07\r\nConcerned by comments from people who downloaded it, I took time into working on optimizing the map.  I went over each area and wrote down the average FPS.  Then I did tons of work trying to up the FPS on each area one by one.  The result is a faster map that should be playable by people who are accustomed to more than 20 FPS.  (My comp is seriously so bad that I had forgotten about optimizing because I'm accustomed to lag.)  The map still has some slow spots, but many areas saw major improvements.\r\n\r\nI'd much appreciate it if someone with a faster comp could look over it and tell me if it's doing allright now.\r\n\r\nAlso, the new filename is zm_cabin_v2b.bsp</font>"
