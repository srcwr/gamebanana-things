Because it's for Counter-strike Source. And why Counter-strike Source ? Because there's too many people that asked me to make a CSS version.\r\n\r\nThe map is exactly the same as the HL2DM version, with 2 bomb targets and 2x24 spawns for T's and CT's. CT's begin the game behind the huge rock and the T's behind the little bunker, they cannot see the other team at the beginning of the game."
