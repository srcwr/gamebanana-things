I'm keeping the other version up because big servers might like that one better.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n-Fixed various issues with players getting stuck\r\n-Fixed a rare bug in the joker card\r\n\r\nMade by: SmOoth.nl\r\nInspiration:www.cardstacker.com (I do realise it looks nothing like what he makes)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\nSmOoth.nl"
