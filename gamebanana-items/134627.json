	"_sText": "This is my first map :D So be gentle :P. Anyways, constructive criticism is encouraged. I made this map because I found that funtimes wasn't as fast and close quarters as I would like it to be. Ladders add an extra dimension of gameplay :). This map supports 24 players, it can get a little hectic, but this map makes for great endings, often suspenseful. Anyways, Enjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog: June 16th: Added Skybox, changed ladder textures, added a couple props, changed lighting.\r\n                 June 17th: Added light_environment"
