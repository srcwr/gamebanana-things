I immediately set about planning the map, and figuring out how to create the REAL cel-shaded effect. This map was then born.\r\n\r\nI worked on this for only 2 or 3 hours, and it is quite small. Only mp5s are available on this map, but they all have 300 ammo.\r\n\r\nThe map is non-decompilable, so no-one can steal this little trick.\r\n\r\nI know that Lost has a similar map in production, or finished, but this map was in no way copied from him. In fact, the method for achieving the outlines maybe different, as I know two ways, and I think I did the more difficult way.\r\n\r\nWell, enjoy =)\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size: large;\">Please favourite if you like!</p>"
