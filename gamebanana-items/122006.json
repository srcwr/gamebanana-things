(^;*)\r\nI used pretty damn long time on this, and i rly hope you like it as.. Well, it's my first map i actually cared to finish lol.\r\n\r\nI think the deathmatch mod should fit in quite smoothly on this map, and the noblock mod would also be pretty handy some places.\r\n\r\nWell this is the first readme i've ever written i think, and since i pretty much made the whole map myself, the Credits list wont be long :P.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nPro...in mapping xD for fixing some technical problems\r\nthe rest of the members at eni.community.org for trying out my map, and just being kewl ^^\r\n\r\nWell.. that was that, enjoy my map.\r\n\r\n"
