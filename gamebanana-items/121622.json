(It is meant to be difficult!)\r\n\r\n- Both teams spawn together without any weapons (no pistols or knives).\r\n\r\n- The screenshots shown are NOT the best. I tried to get the overview of each level but they came out a bit sloppy.\r\n\r\nHow the jail works:\r\n- The jail timers start counting once a player has beaten the first stage.\r\n- After it the first stage has been beaten, the jail is active and the players that spawn in it are released every 20 seconds.\r\n- After 9 releases (3 mins) it will count 20 seconds before the auto-kill engages.\r\n- Also, after 3 mins, jump rope is disabled (The timer for this starts at round start).\r\n\r\nUpon entering the jail you receive...\r\n- Stage 1: Nothing\r\n- Stage 2: A grenade\r\n- Stage 3: Nothing, but your level of jail has grenade spawners\r\n\r\nI'd rather not ask for constructive criticism cause I honestly don't care, this map is the way Faj & I like it. Although, compliments are welcome.\r\n\r\n-- Buck Nasty\r\n\r\nhttp://waspnest.net/\r\nhttp://solidsurf.info/"
