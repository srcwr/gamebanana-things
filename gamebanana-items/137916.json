Surf_summer is a map published under the newly formed level design team, JSurf Studios, which is led by Hardex and Tioga060.<br><br>Welcome to the sun-soaked bliss that is surf_summer. In this map you’ll get to experience everything you’d want out of the perfect summer. From a trip to the beach, to a skatepark, to a waterpark, and even deep sea diving, we’ve got it all.&nbsp;<br><br>At tier 2 difficulty, surf_summer is a map designed for beginner surfers, but we also had experienced surfers in mind! They will have a fun time discovering all of the shortcuts and optimizing their route to perfect a speed run through the map.&nbsp;<br><br>When Fnatic contacted us to create this project, we knew we had to come up with exciting ways to promote their new summer product line, so the map comes with an in-game reward system that will let you unlock different player models for progressing through the map.&nbsp;<br><br>The map also has lots of easter eggs to discover, so look closely as you surf!\r\n<br><br>The map includes awesome artwork from Ferry Gouw, a graphic designer most widely known for his work with Major Lazer. OWSLA has agreed to let us use their music in the project, so check out the groovy soundtrack throughout the map!<br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Gc0sD9W.png\" title=\"\"><br><br>Note: surf_summer_ksf is a much lighter version created for KSF CS Source servers. It is about 200mb less than the complete port. <br>"
