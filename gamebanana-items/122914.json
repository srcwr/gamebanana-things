	"_sText": "This map is my pride and joy. I spent countless hours working on it, and for the first time I am proud to release something. I spent a lot of time in making exciting jails as well as the surf.\r\n\r\nThe timer is set at 5 minutes. If you fail to beat the map in the given amount of time, the map randomly chooses from three combat jails\r\n\r\n- Deagle arena\r\n\r\n- Highspeed knife arena\r\n\r\n- Awp arena with breaking glass platforms\r\n\r\n----\r\nThe \"win jail\" is a jail with two alternatives. Either you can press the blue button for a m249, deagle and knife. Or you can press the red button and blocks will start falling randomly from the roof, smashing everyone.\r\n\r\nJail explanation.\r\nIn the win room, you enter the pyramid. There you will find 4 sprites.\r\n\r\nBlue sprite - Knife arena\r\nRed sprite - Deagle arena\r\nPink sprite - Awp arena\r\nGreen sprite - Punishment jail. (See: \"win jail\" above)\r\n----\r\nI'd like to thank Ryan Sterner for being helpful. I would also thank cloud and Esel for testing my map a lot.\r\n....\r\n\r\nI hope you have a lot of fun playing this map, and I would be very happy if you gave me a rating.\r\n\r\n- razEr"
