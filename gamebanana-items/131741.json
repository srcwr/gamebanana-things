	"_sText": "== ZM_DUSTPANIC_B3 ==\r\n\r\nB3 release of the map.  Fixes all the exploits from ZM_dustpanic_b2.\r\n\r\nThis is a loose remake & remix of the classic ZM map \"lila_panic\".  It doesn't follow the original design or layout very closely, so while the map is obviously inspired by Lila_panic I've given it my own twists.  \r\nAlso, as the name suggests, this map is made in the theme of DE_DUST.\r\n\r\nThe map has been designed with balance in mind!  It should not be dominated by CTs or by zombies - both teams should be able to move around fluidly throughout the map, and camping spots are not impossible for zombies to reach up to.\r\n\r\nFeatures full HDR, Colour Correction (new in B3), Cubemapping, 64 Spawnpoints, and Net Optimization (this map should not lag).\r\n\r\nSimply extract this to your CStrike/maps folder.  No additional files are needed!\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Jb_gamble, Eastsider and Gargantua for feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n=== Map by SAXON 2009 ===\r\n-------------------------"
