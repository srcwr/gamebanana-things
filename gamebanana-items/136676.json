	"_sText": "Here's a second in a possible series of \"smooth\" maps I've made. Only a few sharp corners and nice neon lighting to finish off the smooth, clean visual effect I like in my gungame maps. Since the last one was blue, I wanted to go with a different color, but warm colors seemed to make the map a little more hostile, while the green was a nice medium color with a little edge to it.\r\n\r\nThere are buyzones. Gungame turns them off, I believe. If not, I guess you can buy stuff.\r\n\r\nIn the next version there will be monster truck sounds. Maybe."
