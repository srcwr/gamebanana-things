	"_sText": "I'd like to introduce you our latest map for zombiemod, zm_valais. It is a medium-sized map intended for fast rounds in which you'll find a big house in the highlands. And what do you find in a house? Plenty of barricade spots for you to use! But i nthis map you also get some classic, box-based climbing spots.\r\nAll of this, good-looking and optimized for low-end computers!\r\n\r\nMain features of this map are:\r\n\r\n- 64 spawnpoints, for your average big-server owners.\r\n\r\n- Plenty of barricade spots, from very easy to hard.\r\n\r\n- Climbing spots in house courtyard (box-based)\r\n\r\n- Detailed house with cellar included.\r\n\r\n- Ambient lighting.\r\n\r\n- Optimized for low-end PC's\r\n\r\nI hope you like it!"
