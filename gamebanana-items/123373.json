The tiles that need to be broken to get to above mentioned area is now much more obvious, seen in Screen shot 3 as the newer looking concrete. Re-textured everything but the main walls, and the breakable blocks. The \"shield\" at the base of spawn can now be shot through, this IS intentional. That's about it.\r\nHave Fun"
