The early typo error made it to his final name.\r\n\r\nBig thanks go out to:\r\n\r\nChizbone for yet another great nav file\r\nPhqnix for his toon textures\r\nKaratekaefer for the best toon skybox around.\r\n\r\nIt works great on gg deathmatch servers, and is atm very popular on our server too.\r\n\r\n32 spawns and a fair size. Typical gg map so no buyzones unfortunately. 2 tunnels to rush the other side fast."
