This is Javier aka Revanger the owner of www.fe-gaming.net Gaming Community. I’ve created my second map and I got inspired of the original aim_deagle however my map is made from the scratch not just texture changes/copy pasta. I’ve added one secret teleport or well not really secret but now really seen either, I’ve added water you can fight in as well.\r\n\r\nThis is a medium sized aim deagle map for people that like these kind of maps, please post what you think but do not flame please. This took me a day to create so it’s not a big project but I believe you can enjoy playing the map. If you’ve added the map to your server then feel  free to share the IP-Adress in a comment below.\r\nCheck the map out and tell me what I could’ve changed, feel free to edit the map and re-make it how you want it, this map is made for www.fe-gaming.net, a Counter Strike: Source & L4D2 Gaming Community + CS:S Support Forum.\r\n\r\n<b>[TO INSTALL]:</b>\r\nDownload the map and simple put it in your maps folder. Copy the name aim_deagle_fe and put it in your mapcycle/maplist or whatever your server uses. If you are using a fastDL server you have to convert the file to bzip using 7zip program, put the converted file in to your webhost folder (cstrike/maps) and the original .bsp file in your server cstrike/maps.\r\n\r\n<b>[OTHER]:</b>\r\nPlease remember to visit and register us at www.fe-gaming.net. You can find our sourcebans at www.fe-gaming.net if you are interested of getting our IP-adresses quicker. Please comment and share opinions about the map and what I could’ve done better!\r\n\r\n"
