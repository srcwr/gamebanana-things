	"_sText": "I suck with glocks, so I made this map quick to work on them.  The middle is mid-range and the sides let you get into tight spaces to fight.  This map is no masterpiece by any means :D but I at least have another fast-paced map to practice on.  BTW CT's have USP's because for the life of me I can't remember how to strip weapons.\r\n\r\n**Updated** Better glock spawns, added g7g to the wall.  No major changes but a little more organized."
