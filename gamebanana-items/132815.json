	"_sText": "In this remake of the famous zm_cbble_b4,one of Moo's masterpieces; while keeping the original gameplay, we added a new theme to it: space.\r\n\r\nIt also got new rooms, a mech warrior-like robot and trough the skybox you can see the ominous space ring from Halo games.\r\n\r\nIn this revamped version of cbble, you will find:\r\n\r\n- 64 spawnpoints.\r\n- Original gameplay that made cbble_b4 famous among zm maps.\r\n- Some spots tweaked for balance.\r\n- More rooms, with more cbble-like box spots.\r\n- Complete new theme: now cbble is some sort of spaceship with a containment breach.\r\n- Revised lighting for realistic looks.\r\n- Optimized for low-end machines.\r\n\r\nWe already tested it ingame and the map is reported to be 100% bug-free!\r\nEnjoy!"
