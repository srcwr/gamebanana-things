If you want people to be able to\r\ndownload the map directly from your server, you must use this command:\r\n\r\nnet_maxfilesize 60\r\n\r\nDefault 16mb. 4way_spacetunnel is 54mb.\r\n\r\nWithout this command changed to 54, people will not be able to download it and will get\r\nan error message like \"Map zm_4way_spacetunnel_idm_v1f.bsp is missing\".\r\n----->If your server BZIPs the map you're ok.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nMap Information:\r\n\r\nFilesize: 54 mb\r\nSpawnpoints: 72\r\nSpecial Features: 2 spaceships (1 drivable), no fall damage\r\nCustom Textures Used: yes\r\nCustom Sounds Used: yes\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nCopy the cstrike folder into your \"\".../steam/steamapps/username/counter-strike source/\"\r\nfolder. Click yes to all and you are done.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This map uses a point_servercommand to set sv_turbophysics to 0. Otherwise\r\nyou won't be able to fly in the little spaceship. When your server has banned \"point_servercommand\" then use the cfg file that is packed into the rar file.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA couple of features:\r\n\r\n* 2 Spaceships! And one of those you can drive yourself!\r\n* No fall damage!\r\n* New elevators\r\n* New buildings.\r\n* Well balanced spots, not impossible for zombies and not to easy\r\n* 1 \"secret\" where you can blow up the drivable spaceship with. \r\n(opens 3 minutes after someone got into the spaceship\r\n* Totally retextured.! Lot's of custom textures used,\r\n* 72 (!) spawn points for big servers\r\n* Much bigger spawn area\r\n* Advanced Teleporters (make the map faster)\r\n* New elevator system in stead of the old crane\r\n* And much much more.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n=======\r\nCREDITS:\r\n=======\r\n\r\nOriginal map by: Neko_Daisuki\r\nRemake made by: [ZFC] idm\r\nSome of the most used textures in this map are made by: [ZFC] Satch\r\nThe drivable spaceship is made by: Fox (got it here from fpsbanana)\r\nEdits to the spaceship made by: [ZFC] idm\r\nMost textured are edited by [ZFC] idm to implement them into the \r\nmap and make them look shiney and 3d like.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\n\r\n[ZFC] Satch, made some really really nice textures which fit very good into the scene. Without him I wouldn't even have started building this remake.\r\n[ZMoD] Spelworm, helped me a lot with debugging and testing. Thanks!"
