The map also goes a lot like de_nuke, with the bombsites on top of each other. Have fun!<br><br>From now on, this map will receive updates whenever all of the \"to do's\" are checked. I will add a few \"to do's\" whenever I am working on an update, so you can make an idea how it's going to be.<br><br>This map is still in its beta stage. I thought some feedback would be useful at this moment.<br>"
