The map's theme is loosely based on de_nuke, and is basically a hybrid between ultra-realism and unbelievability. The map contains 2 (large) jail cells, a wall, a gun pit, t spawn (complete with rebel way), gun toss, a pit for chicken fight/knife fight/western shootout, and a shot for shot arena. Also included with the map is a radar overlay. Note: The radar has a small bug where it stretches once outside of the boundaries of the map (you'll see what I mean). From what I could tell, it's nothing to worry about.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nInstall: Put the bsp into cstrike/maps folder.\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nThanks goes out to:\r\n\r\nRyan Sterner, for help with optimization.\r\nTAG Servers, for hosting both betas and providing various feedback from the playerbase\r\nEtrigan, for ideas and testing along the way.\r\nTurkey Eater, for ideas and testing along the way.\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.solidsurf.info\r\nhttp://www.interlopers.net\r\nhttp://www.tagservers.com</font>"
