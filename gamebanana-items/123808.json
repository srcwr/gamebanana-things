	"_sText": "A mario jump map I made. \r\n\r\nHas multiple jump courses to jump on, the ? Boxes at the beginning of the map can spawn weapons when jumped under.\r\n\r\nMusic is played throughout the map, from the theme of super Mario.\r\nCustom sounds are included to add to the experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason why the map is in fullbright, is because lighting looked really ugly and looked more of a mario theme if it was in fullbright.\r\n\r\nAs a mapper who is against the idea of floating jump platforms, I used some only because Mario games actually have stuff floating in mid air.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy this map\r\n\r\n-Disturbed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to iconic . for the Mario Textures "
