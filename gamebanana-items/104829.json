T has always had unfair advantage over CT with sniper on roof of T spawn. so now CT can get their revenge with their new sniper tower. Also added a \"secret\" walkway directly from bomb zone to T spawn. (look down!) and a not-so-secret sniper location, but to get there, its a secret.\r\nIt could properly be better, but i haven't mapped in a very long time..\r\n\r\nHave fun !\r\n"
