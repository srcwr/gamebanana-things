Old version was awful (bugs, no lighting, shitty textures) and in Hammer editor it was far worse.\r\nSo I erased the nearly 100% of the entire map and built it again.\r\nAll bugs are (I hope) fixed. \r\nThe main plot of map is now set in spooky old mines.\r\nWho will win the map, can open the mine for zombies and let them kill all players.\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\">\r\n<td nowrap>\r\n<font size=\"3\" color=\"yellow\">\r\n<b>Contains:</b></font>\r\n<font size=\"2\">\r\n<br>- new levels\r\n<br>- dark atmosphere\r\n<br>- new traps\r\n<br>- music, minor sound effects\r\n<br>- HDR lighting</font>\r\n</td>\r\n</table>"
