They smuggled the money down to their hideout, but only a little of the money was taken before an elite counter-terroist unit was dispatched. They have to stop the terrorists while being careful about other people since the terrorists already killed one innocent...\r\n\r\nTIPS:\r\n\r\nThere is a ladder above the crashed trailer which makes a good vantage point\r\nThe fruit boxes make a good bridge to the trailer if you crouch jump to the trailer\r\n\r\nHELP IN:\r\n\r\nIf any one can help me about making the car alarm sound go on through out the game, pls tell me :)\r\nAlso, if anyone can pls help make a radar image for this map, i will be very thankful :)\r\n\r\n "
