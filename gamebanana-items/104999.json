	"_sText": "There are three secret doors.  One is in the abandoned room (lower floor by T spawn).  There is a button to open it behind the third shelf from the left (you will notice sparks).  If you run straight through it, there is a teleporter that will return you back outside the door.  To pass it, jump to the edge inside, or sit on the box, shoot the button, and enter on the right side of the secret door.  The second secret door has a similar button just beyond that point, which opens up right into the bomb site.  The final secret door isn't as secretive--it takes you from the warehouse to the bomb site, and is textured in a way that you will notice it anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is my first map--hope you enjoy!"
