(infinite ammo/health)\r\n\t- Cash area - need money? get it HERE! an automized system will set your cash to 16000 and back to 0, repeating this process until you reach the cash achievment. (uses mani admin and still not tested)\r\n\t- Props hole - Shoot the crates inside to get an achievement.\r\nExtra areas:\r\n\t- Healer\r\n\t- Buyzone</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend><b>Achievement_bombing</b></legend>\r\nEather join T if you want to plant the bomb, or CT if you want to defuse.</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend><b>Achievement_easyround</b></legend>\r\nAdd a CT bot automaticly win as many rounds as you want, just leave the server when you are finished.</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend><b>Achievement_linedup</b></legend>\r\nWhats the best way to get weapon kills?
