	"_sText": "This map is a simple map based on my previous release fy_stonehenge, but this time, stonehenge has been rebuilt!\r\n\r\nThis map is a quick paced and balanced map. Players can easily get around and hide for cover around the structure. This map uses buyzones to lower the fps of the gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe lighting in the game is dark, but not too dark for players to see eachother. The lighting isn't bad, you just really can't see that through a screenshot or two.\r\n\r\nThere is a small campfire in the middle of the whole structure that deals damage, so watch out.\r\n\r\nPlease comment or advise, as I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUpdate!\r\n\r\n- Players now have a hill to walk up before entering the battlefield, to reduce or stop spawnkilling.\r\n\r\n- Small spikes have been reduced in size for players to walk over.\r\n\r\n- Play area is now round.\r\n========================================================\r\nCredits - Dark age people\r\n\r\nThankyou and Enjoy playing."
