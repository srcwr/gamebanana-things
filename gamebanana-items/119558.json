	"_sText": "This 1v1 arena is set atop a tall building, within a city, at sunset. There are two knives partially hidden in the map, and a hidden grenade. To step over the edge of the building is to leave a blood splatter on the street below. Also, try to find the Godzilla secret. \r\n\r\nIt actually holds 2v2, because of the spawns. There are custom models bspzipped within, as well as many effects, such as wind, falling off the building, and multiple blood splats on the street below as more and more ppl fall off."
