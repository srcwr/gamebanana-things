	"_sText": "This is the 5th and  final version of my\r\nattempt to convert the original cs_italy into a bomb defuse map. This process\r\nstarted relatively simple but over the months I found it necessary to change\r\nmore and more about the map to make it work as a fair, competitive and fun\r\ndefuse map . Besides gameplay and layout changes I also slowly\r\nadded more and more details to make the map feel a bit more fresh and up to\r\ndate. <o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nIm now finally happy with the result. It\r\nlooks good enough and it plays very well in my opinion. But most importantly, while\r\nmaking quite significant changes, I think, I still retained the feeling of key\r\nareas of the original map as well as the feel of the map in general. But that’s\r\nultimately for you to decide. <o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe map has 50 slots – just for good measure.\r\n<o:p></o:p><br><br>\r\n\r\nHave fun.  <o:p></o:p><br><br>"
