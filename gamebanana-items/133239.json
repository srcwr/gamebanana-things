Not much else can describe it.\r\n\r\nUpdate Notes:\r\n\r\nV2:\r\n- Removed outer walls and replaced with a fence to show a more desolate location.\r\n- Added volumetric lighting for the towers.\r\n- Added lighting in middle room.\r\n- Added dust clouds.\r\n- Made the secret room less desirable to camp by having it deal 5 damage per second to anyone in there.\r\n\r\nThings to do:\r\nNothing I can think of."
