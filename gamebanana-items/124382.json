	"_sText": "For the longest time I wanted to make a map themed around hell/the underworld, this is how it turned out, pretty fun to run imo. About a minute fully routed for good players, high 50 possible. Tried to make the gameplay different from my usual style. Make sure when you zone the bonus start you only zone the red area I have marked, because the bonus isn't possible without the ability to prespeed.&nbsp; Was originally going to spend longer on the map but decided I wanted to work on a much bigger project now so I'm releasing what I've mapped so far, in what I consider a pretty good state. Have fun!<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqpimzh5z4o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
