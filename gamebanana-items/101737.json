(higher elevation) \r\nSo if you want a challenge, Join the T's.\r\n\r\nThis map has:\r\n\r\n-40 Spawnpoints\r\n-HDR\r\n-Buyzones for GunGame version.\r\n-Reduced gravity to 0.8 (1 being normal gravity.)\r\n\r\nI've spent a month (procrastinating included) making this map/getting the layout right.\r\nSo if you say anything about there being not enough props \r\nI'll slap you across the face then kill you in your sleep. (Not really.)\r\n\r\nYou can find this map on: 209.247.83.162:27015"
