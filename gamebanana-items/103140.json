	"_sText": "Second map, \r\nits only alpha.\r\n\r\nIt's a militia map. \r\nBut i wanted to make it more like a dust map.\r\n\r\nIts a bit of both. And its to give the feel of some eastern terrorism type thing. \r\n\r\nI have not actually tested it yet, probs some errors. \r\n\r\nIf i get good feedback, Ill make it look pro.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking. Hope you like my idea. \r\n\r\nAnd yes the map is darkish, But i want the gameplay to be hard. It's bright too! where it should be! So dont complain\r\n\r\n"
