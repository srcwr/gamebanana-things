They are especially hate a places of public catering - Baltic Cafe and Restaurant Hungriges Schwein... as it's right: came to watch football, so isn't necessary to fill a belly any rubbish!  :-)\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by mapauthor included in original .bsp and available to downloading with the [same map](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/50898).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also always will be grateful for your remarks and feedbacks ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   Dukeblooders (for nice designed and fun playable indoor map).\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nHail to Zidane, Knockdown for Materazzi! :-)"
