	"_sText": "<fieldset>\r\nA medium sized Gun Game Map, Very straightforward gameplay here, no real easy way to hide from people or for very long.\r\n\r\nSimple three level system here, ground floor, a few things to stand on and 4 walkways at medium hight and two parralel platforms at the very top in the middle.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset>\r\nMap concept time for this didn't take too long, neither did construction or compiling so this was a pretty quick release here. Next maps for this game type will be same size or smaller for quicker rounds as its been requested many times by people here and also on our GG server.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset>\r\nNav file and any other nessasary files are included inside the bsp so don't say I forgot it cause it is there heh. should be no problems on that end.\r\n\r\nJust note that bots rarly if ever use the upper floors which is nicer for people because that would just slow the game down if they are stuck agaist only bots :P\r\n\r\n\r\nwell, enjoy the map, going to probally finish up another one this weekend,\r\nLost,\r\n\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<div><center><a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" property=\"dc:title\">wmd_conduit</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/109641\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Logan Dougall</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike 2.5 Canada License</a>.<br />Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/109641\" rel=\"cc:morePermissions\">Here</a>.</center></div>"
