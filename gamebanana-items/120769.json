	"_sText": "Hey all, this is my first serious map and I'm quite proud of it. It's a small, fun map based on one simple idea...blow s***t up!\r\n\r\nThe only objective is to blow the enemy team outta the sky. There's also 2 \"hidden\" guns in the level although be careful as each gun has only one clip, so shoot wisely.\r\n\r\nThe design was purely improv so it's not the best design in the world and it's a little off centre. But to make up for that theres a massive bit of fake DMM glass right in the middle of the map seperating the two teams, just waiting to be blown up.\r\n\r\nIf you use it in a server be sure to send me a message, I really want to play this with a full 16 players!\r\n\r\nP.S. gf stands simply for \"Grenade Fun\" :)"
