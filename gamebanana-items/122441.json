	"_sText": "Well, in the last day or so, I've been working on ths map, surf_lineatric. It's not meant to be particularly hard, but some bits will frustrate you, quite a lot. I have built the cubemaps, but it doesn't appear so. I have removed fall damage, and have included both lighting and fog. All textures are default. The only bugs so far are on the 2nd ramp, going to slow will cause you to stop, and on the 2nd last ramp, there is a small mesh failure, but it will not stopyou. I am currently fixing these now.\r\n\r\nConstructive Criticism would be greatly appreciated. "
