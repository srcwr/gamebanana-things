	"_sText": " Two teams on either side of a big glass wall (which can be climbed on the edges). The glass wall has 3 holes in it, 2 of which are blocked with glass which must be broken. Theres a secret buyzone, but getting there, hurts, and getting out is even more painful! All the water is acidic, and all the wood is breakable - but BE AWARE: it IS possible to get up onto the wood, and it is possible to climb around, just dont expect textures ;)"
