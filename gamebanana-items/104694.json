For now, it is only available as a bomb/defuse map, but I shall try in future releases to improve the quality of the map and also the gameplay of the map.\r\n\r\nFixes/updates\r\n\t-->Rain sound should now continue to play throughout the game.\r\n\t-->Whole map has been retextured from Nodraw, which should increase FPS.\r\n\t-->Improved lighting.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n\t-->Map has only been compiled in Fast VVIS becuase it's only a beta released at the moment and I can't leave \t   it compiling for thousands of hours.\r\n\t-->The .nav file isn't custom, so bots sometimes will camp in one spot and sometimes a terrorist will tend to \t   use a fence as a bouncy castle.\r\n\r\nIf you spot any other bugs/improvements, please comment and/or message me on Steam ( J4CK8 )\r\n\r\nStill have not compiled the map with vvis on normal, so please, if you can, help!\r\n\r\n.BSP and .NAV file to go into your CounterStrikeSource/Cstrike/maps folder.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"445\" height=\"364\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_rRf2U8Vt5o&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_rRf2U8Vt5o&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"445\" height=\"364\"></embed></object> (Video made be me and Beanz, edited by Beanz)"
