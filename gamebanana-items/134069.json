Gameplay is centered around the map's isometric, \"figure of 8\" design and features a good blend of long and medium ranged combat.\r\n___________________________________\r\n<h2>A few Features of this map:</h2><b>+Constant, high FPS\r\n+HDR\r\n+90 Spawns (you can never have too many :P)\r\n+Volumetric lighting in spawn points\r\n+Isometric, \"Figure of 8 design\" design.\r\n___________________________________<h2>Like this map?
