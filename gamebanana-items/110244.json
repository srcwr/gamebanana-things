	"_sText": "This idea started out one night while playing on my clan S.]A[.U's server. We were playing football with a deagle that some how had low gravity when we didnt. We figured out how to make the deagle have low gravity then my friend said hey, MAKE A FOOTBALL MAP! And i was like...fiiiiine. Its not perfect, its not amazing, but it can be fun.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to play football with the gun gravity, heres how you do it.\r\nsv_gravity 150\r\nchangelevel ka_footballbeta_fix\r\nsv_gravity 800\r\nType those commands in console in that order. (Obviously wait til the map loads to type gravity 800)\r\nOr you could hop on S.]A[.U's server which is on my profile and i could set it all up. If you took the time to read this, thanks! "
