A doorway to get out, rocks and trees to give the enviroment a very nice look, together with a waterfall in the middle.\r\n\r\n The 2 Teleporters at each spawn has been removed, the \"cave\" has no ragdolls anymore nor are there any weapons there, instead boths sides has been replaced with some crates.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPreview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFMc1oIme0k\r\n"
