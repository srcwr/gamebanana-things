	"_sText": "This is the second version of de_mallpark\r\nthe most significant change would be that the terrorist team now has easy access to the roof via a climbable pole and short ladder. I've added 4 busstops and several obstacles on the roof. ive also added another truck in the back area of the mall. last of all i added plenty of light props. please tell me what you think of this map as opposed to the first version."
