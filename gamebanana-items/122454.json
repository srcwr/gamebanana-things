	"_sText": "This map contains 9 stages and a bonus.\r\nIt's made for surf-timer servers, so there isn't any jail.\r\n\r\nThe reason I, silverlol made this map is show that a map doesn't need to be detailed and beautiful to be a good map, so I didn't give a shit about textures or lightning, I played with textures and the lightning to see what might fit each other, but I didn't care about if it looks good or not.\r\n\r\nI've got a lot of positive responses on the surf, which was what I wanted to achieve, I hope you think the same thing and you enjoy the surf and the environment you surf in even though it might not live up to your expectations - so please judge this by the surf and not only on the looks! Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nThe bonus is not dark, not if you turn up your brightness and put CS:S in fullscreen, then there shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks to the beta testers and Skittl35.\r\nHope you enjoy the map.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There's a little \"easter egg\" inside.\r\n\r\nKSF Surf Timer Server, up 24/7, most popular!\r\nJoin at: 184.172.22.240:27015"
