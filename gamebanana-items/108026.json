I have build all symetric, i think its better for the Fair Gameplay. I have add volumetric Sun and breakeable Lights (thats a lot more realistic). Test it i hope you like that Map. If some body put the Map on his Server ;), tell me plz i like to play my Map online. (The Hammer Editor Files are in the Pack too, maybe someone like to costum the Map). There are NAV Files into the Pack so you can play offline with BOTS.\r\n\r\n And now have FUN\r\n\r\n\r\nMap made by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/229015\">skillor</a>\r\nNAV Files made by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/55178\">chizbone</a>"
