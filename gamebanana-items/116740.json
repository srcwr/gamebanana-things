I learned to create through trial and error, as I found most places don't really help that much, they allready expect you to know a great deal.\r\n\r\nSo I do still have more to learn, and I definatly need to get to grips with taking advantage of the physics engine, but honestly I don't have much time anymore.\r\n\r\ncubensismagic@hotmail.co.uk"
