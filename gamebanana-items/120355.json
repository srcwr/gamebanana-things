	"_sText": "At this map, I decided to show you some traditions of my country Spain.\r\n\r\nAt this bullring there are 2 bulls (Terrorists) and \"x\" bullfighters (counterterrorist).\r\n\r\nTerrorists have got a \"skin of a bull\" with a funny face and horns to catch bullfighters. They have to kill to the others before of 105 seconds or the bulls will die!\r\n\r\nCounterterrorists have to dodge the other team. Jumping on the bulls or doing \"cuts\".\r\n\r\nThe name of my map is the name of my city and the bullring of my city is a bit similar.\r\nAt the beginning of a round, you could lisent a sound of the bullring like in the real life.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit similiar to the bullring of my city.\r\nDo not worroy about the time of the round becoause I add the commands to change it.\r\nThe round start with 1.45 min to left. No autobalance and no limiteams. After 1.45 min the bulls will die.\r\nHF and remember the vocabulary because if you come to Spain, you can need it XD\r\n\r\nVOCABULARY:\r\n\r\nOl√©: If you do something nice to the bull.\r\n\r\nToro: Bull.\r\n\r\nEh toro!: If you want that they see you.\r\n\r\nMap wtih COPYLEFT. Have fun!\r\n\r\n(I do not why but the web side delated my map)\r\n\r\nThanks to !PosTi85"
