	"_sText": "I originally created a map named aim_pitfall for 1.5 CS about 5 years ago and wanted to sort of \"recreate\" it.  I'm actually excited about this one because you have to have some nerve if you want to get to the other side in a large firefight.  Or just luck :D  I changed some from the original unreleased version I made.  This map holds 18 on each side with AKs and M4s.  There's an AWP \"prize\" in the center on the middle beam if you have the nerve.  Grenades are also on the beam as well as in the pit.  If you fall into the pit as you're crossing because you get distracted, too drunk, or too high, well, your health lowers 76 points if you hit the ground and not the boxes below.  Grenades are in the pit to give you a fighting chance.  Buyzones for both sides are on the center beam if you don't die.  Good luck!  "
