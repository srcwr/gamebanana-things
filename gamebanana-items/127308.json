York\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE FINAL VERSION!\r\n\r\nIf you've played the beta versions you will notice enhanced gameplay in the final version a new trap and a new area for spawn and it all was thought of by Alvin C. York. I appriciate all the feedback and if you have the time add Alvin to your friends list. Bryttonmp5 is his name. Looking for themes and new traps so if your feeling like you have a great simple trap email it to Alvin at Bryttonmp5@yahoo.com!\r\n\r\nDeath run is a type of game play that includes traps that the CT must overcome to reach the end of the run. The terrorists are the ones controlling the entire event, they have complete control over the traps that the CT must trick by. \r\n\r\nThese traps are allowed to be recreated on another map. It is forbidden and dishonorable to decompile this map decompiling this map is only acceptable if you do it to learn how to create something you want to know how to do. \r\n\r\nGoodluck CT happy running"
