Thanks.\r\n\r\nIt is just a small map I have made in the past 2 days. I put a lot of work into this one. It has around 6 different sounds in it. 1 wind, 1 thunder, 1 rain, 1 train, 2 gun sound(s)\r\n\r\nHave fun with it.\r\n\r\nNote: the second screenshot is one of the compile before. I could not get one with the thunder in of the latest compile."
