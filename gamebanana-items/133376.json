	"_sText": "This is a pretty basic remake of textured city advanced. I readjusted the lighting (added some colored lights as well) all around the map, made some small adjustments to the blocks, added glass to the windows and retextured it with my custom, simple textures. I wanted to get rid of the orange/gray and just go for the gray shades so it would be a bit easier on the eyes."
