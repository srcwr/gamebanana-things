Intelligence suggests the terrorists may be in possession of an explosive device. Caution is advised, especially around windows.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Dynamic layout, making for claustrophobic and fast-paced bomb defusal gameplay\r\n- Airlocks!\r\n- Custom skybox depicting Kepler-22b\r\n- Radar Overview\r\n\r\nPlaytesters with different computer specs did not report framerate or crashing issues.\r\n\r\nAuthor's Note:\r\n\r\nAfter about 30 hours work over a hellish month, 6 hours of 4v4 playtesting, final exams, large coffees, and about four listens of Rise Against's entire 2010 Rock Am Ring concert, here it is.\r\n\r\nI hope you have as much fun playing this map as I did making it"
