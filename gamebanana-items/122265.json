	"_sText": "This was a quick build for my friend in the clan HoF, which for short, stands for Hero's of Faith.  Hopefully they, and all who choose to play this will like it.\r\n\r\nIt's a medium size surf with different choices of paths to take, due to the great amount of air that is possible from the main drop.  It is a continuous surf, in that you can basically keep surfing the map without stopping to often, and just keep gaining more and more speed. \r\n\r\nI know some will criticize it, but it was a very quick build.  Enjoy."
