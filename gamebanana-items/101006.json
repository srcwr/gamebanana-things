	"_sText": "This a dust style map,it has 64 spawn points. I made it with just one bomb site because I observed that on the majority of defuse maps,the players prefer one bomb site over another,so why bother with two bomb sites?!Also i made a \"safe house\" for the terrorist team,just in case the CT's are to obnoxious. \r\n Being a Beta 1 version the map has not yet:radar view,soundscapes,a proper 3D skybox and too much detail.\r\n \r\n I would like some feedback if you please,tell me anything you like or you dislike at this map,because a lot of changes may be done to improve it.\r\n "
