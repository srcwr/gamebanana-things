The Ts are the spies and are trying to steal the \"intel\" from the CTS. The Ts have 5 mins to do this.\r\n\r\n***Spies***\r\n\r\n- Smoke grenade\r\n- Spy suit (black)\r\n- Night vision goggles\r\n- Low grav (80%)\r\n- Health Regeneration\r\n- USP\r\n- Partly invisible\r\n- Body Armour\r\n\r\n***CTs***\r\n\r\n- USP\r\n- MP5\r\n- 150 HP\r\n- Grenade\r\n- Body Armour\r\n\r\nThe spies have to first steal the keycard that's in a conference room, and then bring the keycard to the vault door. Then they have to take the briefcase from the vault and bring it back to their spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Generator: Found in back of basement and when the button to it is shot, all the lights will shut off for 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n- 2 Splinter cell songs \r\n\r\n***PICTURES***\r\n\r\n 1. Lobby of building\r\n 2. Conference room (keycard in middle)\r\n 3. Bathroom\r\n 4. T spawn\r\n 5. Intel/Inside of vault\r\n 6. Layout of map\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n***FIXES FOR V2***\r\n\r\n - Change briefcase to brushes\r\n - CTs get MP5s instead of UMPs\r\n - CTs get grenades\r\n - CTs don't get night vision goggles\r\n - The generator can only be shot out once\r\n - Everyone gets body armour\r\n - Added weapons scattered around the map\r\n - Music is louder\r\n - Other small stuff\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI've changed they system so that you drop the bomb into a hole to open the vault and end the round. This should fix  it from being so glitchy.\r\n________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPE YOU LIKE IT!"
