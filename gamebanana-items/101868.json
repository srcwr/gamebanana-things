Battle through the streets or the hallways.  Two bombsites, one is at CT spawn, the other in the middle building.\r\n\r\nAlthough this map is based on the MW2 map \"Skidrow,\" I made it all from memory, did not look at the actual map at all for like a year.  Worked hard on this for 3 days to get accustomed to hammer again after a long break :D"
