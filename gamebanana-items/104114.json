	"_sText": "<p>This map is a Cylinder like station (On the outside) that is being attacked by some raiders (Terrorist) that are trying to invade. It's dark, gloomy and with a lot of secret passages this map has some good techniques. Either the CT's can approach the tunnels with full force, or re-arrange themselves in a good defensive situation. While the terrorists can either go full-on force through the tunnels, or take sneaky passages under the station to get to places within cover. Up to you to decide.</p><p>This map does have some simple rooms; but this is an old map that I just simply never published. I will most likely do an improved version within months time or so. But for now I hope you enjoy this game =)</p><p>I've timed the walk distance to each team; and they both clash at the tunnels!</p><p>Hope you enjoy! :)&nbsp;</p><p>-- I love feedback and opinions!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
