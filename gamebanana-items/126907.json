There isn't much left for me to say about the map except that I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. =]  \r\n\r\nNote: Ts must push the last trap on a floor to advance to the next, and yes this is intentional.\r\n\r\nV3 update-\r\nFixed some bugs and added breaking glass for players who take too long. \r\n"
