Boosters give speed u need, bhop is used to keep that speed when no any other way for that (surf ramps etc.)\r\nRamps u used get higher when needed ofc, with high speeds walkable ramps turn into surf ramps.\r\n\r\nTheres no teles everywhere cause displacements, i wanted keep much many possible ways as possible.\r\n\r\nMap is short but this is just test map for this idea. More levels maybe will be made.\r\n\r\nMap doesnt have much hard strafes, as i said just test map, but i make harder strafes to next levels then.\r\n\r\n\r\nwell, dont have much more to say, that should enought.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nleave some comments and ideas if u have. Help to develope this concept better.\r\nEven \"bad\" ideas are wellcome, everything can be developed better.\r\n\r\nI will use all anyhow usable ideas and creadit those who gave me those ideas to be added to concept. Also theme or other ideas are wellcome.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead and tell if u have any ideas, now u can actually make difference and get some features to map what u want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThx to all beta testers.\r\n\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnote: color correvtion is used and it is on in screenshots. without it map isnt dark at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkybox texture by komaokc:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/1867\r\n\r\nWaterfall texture by topHATTwaffle:\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/textures/2665\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nUPDATE; fixed missing color correction file problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDont affraid to post =)\r\n\r\n"
