You must try to make it to the end of the map which has a tele that goes\r\nto the beggining of the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S In The Next Version, I Want Two Spawns And At The End Theres A Button That Kills The Other Team. But..\r\nI Dont Know How To Do That. If Theres Anyone That Knows How To Do This It Would Be A Big Help.\r\n\r\nThx, RayzaK^"
