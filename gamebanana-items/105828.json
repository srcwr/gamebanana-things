I was drunk at the time.\r\n\r\nBasically, both teams start out at opposite ends of the map (Duh), and there is a raised platform for snipers, but so people don't just go up there and camp I made the middle wall (Which has 2 doors on either side) high enough so snipers on the ledge could not hit people on the ground, only people on the other sniper tower. There is also a ledge about half way up from the ground to the sniper tower that spans the sides of the arena."
