	"_sText": "My take on the Left 4 Dead 1 Apartment level. The architecture is the same but the layout and flow have been redone for play with Counter Strike Source Zombie Mod. Added in several teleports and hidden walls plus couches and soda machines for making barricades. I went for this location for this map as most ZM maps seem to be too bright and I wanted something a little darker. This map has 50 total spawn points, 25 for each side. Originally had a lot of the L4D artwork and signs/graffiti in here but removed them to keep potential copyright problems from popping up.\r\nI made a video highlighting most of the hidden stuff. Some things I added in after feedback from friends so not everything is in this video.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01RbmFUxuhI\r\nAny feedback or ideas, let me know.\r\nThanks in advance!"
