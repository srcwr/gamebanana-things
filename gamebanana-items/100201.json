So I published it hoping it will be played by someone else.\r\n\r\nThis map differs from cs_newoffice_final because:\r\n- there are no weapons;\r\n- hostages are in different floors;\r\n- there are 45 spawns per team;\r\n- there is a great fps improvement, thanks to a lot of time spent in optimizations;\r\n- there are some layout modifications (wider stairs & new alley).\r\n\r\nGood frags.\r\n\r\nzzdd"
