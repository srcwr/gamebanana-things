	"_sText": "This is my attempt to make the most realistic map that i could make. This is based off of a fake desert location. I tried to make it as even as possible but in war there is no such thing as even. This is a realistic map T's have to go and FIND the money no marks nothing. Same for Ct's.\r\n\r\n<b>STORY:</b>\r\nThe terrorist have come into a small area and taken it over. An elite group of CT's have been called in to stop the T's in their track.\r\n\r\n<b>INTEL:</b>\r\nThe T's have bought weapons from dealers but were caught in the act and had to scatter in the scatter they accidentally misplaced the money. With dirty money and illegal ammo and firearms they go back to blow it up. \r\nT's: destroy the money or eleminate the opposing CT's\r\nCT's: Protect the money to bring under further investigation for the FBI\r\n\r\nThere is your mission now go out there and get it done!\r\n\r\n(this is a beta 1)\r\nThanks to Kirby's Playhouse for the beta test help.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n-Jarhead"
