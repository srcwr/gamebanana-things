Once in the city, dodge buildings, and others.\r\nYou'll have to walk in into a large building to get acces to the airplane. There are several alternatives and holdspots.\r\nOnce inside the plane, humans should go inside the cockpit, zombies inside the cargo.\r\nA bit later, they will crash into a snow area and they will have to make their way to the sea where the ark is.\r\nThe ark is the final fight.</fieldset>\r\n\r\nPrograms used:\r\nPhotoshop Cs4\r\nVtfEDIT\r\nSourceSdk\r\nAudacity\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<font color=orange>This is the newest version, with added difficulties and a by far better optimized cityscene.
