There are good sniping spots as well as tight gun fights. I suppose you could also use this map for gun-game mod also as there are no buy zones. by the way high fps!\r\n\r\nCredits to Hamster for the large Automatic Door prefab.\r\n\r\nwatch out for the death traps....\r\n\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\nplease provide your feedback.
