In recent years it has been the center of many skirmishes between Terrorist and Counter-Terrorism groups.    There are Scout Sniper rifles on the roof of all 4 buildings, Colt M4A1 inside the blue base, and AK47 inside the red base.    Inbetween the red and blue bases are a series of other weapon drops including M3 shotgun, sg552 assault rifle, MP5 Navy, TMP, mac10 and Famas.\r\n\r\n** END TRANSMISSION **\r\n\r\nThis is the 11th beta, but the first one I have posted on FPSBanana.   If you have any suggestions please feel free to comment."
