	"_sText": "This is a pratice map I did a while ago and I just found it back in an old USB drive. Like some people asked me for this map in the past, I'll publish it here. This map contains :\r\n- LongJump from 250 to 280 units\r\n- Runboost from 530 to 600 units\r\n- Sky from 350 to 600 units\r\n- MegaHigh flash from x1 to x5\r\n- MegaLong flash from x1 to x10\r\n\r\nNote : Some of the distance may be impossible (such as 600 RB) or wrong (such as x10 ML distance calculated with an algorithm).\r\n\r\nEdit : It seems like the triggers in the MegaLong room were all removed when I compiled the map, but it's now fixed. (Redownload it if you'd the first version - Sorry)"
