	"_sText": "Map : de_gardensbeta\r\nMode : Defusal / Bomb\r\nMax Players : 16\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated by Devlus\r\n\r\nThis is my first released map and for the most part, my first map (I made one before this but it was mainly to get used to Hammer). It's a small defusal map designed for quick fights and even quicker rounds. I apologize for the small map size but, like I said, it's my first map. The two bombsites are the large Oak Tree in front of the Tspawn, and the Micro Maze to the right of the Tspawn.\r\n\r\nThe design idea behind the map was a gentle, almost relaxing map with bright colours and pleasant surrondings. That being said, I included an easter egg that is less than pleasant. I may come back and do extra work or details on the map, but for now, I present de_GardensBeta! Please enjoy!\r\n\r\nIf you have feedback of any kind, please drop me a message at selphinwolfe@aol.com.\r\n\r\nUses textures from HL2 and CS:S"
