Terrorist must destroy ammo squad on square beyond the gate, which is open and close by two buttons inside the fort. To bombsite is one more way. It's small map, so there is only one bombsite.\r\n\r\n-Radar included( But not green, because i don't know graphic programs and i can't do this :<)\r\n\r\n-Place names and navigotion mesh included\r\n\r\n-HDR included\r\n\r\nIt's 32 spawns, but this is map for rather less players.\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad english."
