The main idea was to make a map with nice flow and no interruptions from start to finish.<br>Most props in the map are made with \"Propper\". I hope you will enjoy playing this map as much as I enjoyed making it. <br>Let me know if u like the map or maybe find any bugs.<br><br><br><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9O5kiZeuyY\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<b>\t\t[CS:GO] Version </b><br><pre><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1286766098\" target=\"_blank\">bhop_temple_ruins_go<br></a></pre>"
