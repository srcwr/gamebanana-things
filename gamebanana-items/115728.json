	"_sText": "Duckhunt2 is a mildly upgraded version of cs_duckhunt:\r\nhttp://css.gamebanana.com/maps/172577\r\n\r\nHow to play Duckhunt: The Terrorist team are the Ducks and the CT team is the Duck Hunters. The Ducks must use the Druid of the Talon race and prevent their opponents from rescuing the hostages. The Duck Hunters must use a shotgun (not the knife) and attempt to rescue the hostages. Specific race rules are provided in-game and may be adjusted as seen fit.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n    Regeneration zone for use by the Ducks (may be switched off by Admins via teleportation)\r\n    Shotguns provided at CT spawn with 1000 ammunition\r\n    Spawn killer activated after 60 seconds to prevent spawn camping\r\n    Kevlar provided for all players\r\n\r\nMajor improvements in this version:\r\n\r\n- Increased regen zone\r\n- Hostie zone changed\r\n- Added buildings\r\n- Trees changed to be far less obstructive (trunks are the only parts that clip now)\r\n- Hosties are withheld for 2 minutes before they can be rescued\r\n\r\nPS: People on my server have made a plug-in for the duckhunt game mode, if people are interested I'm sure I could pass it along."
