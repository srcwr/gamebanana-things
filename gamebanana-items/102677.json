	"_sText": "In this map, I wanted to recreate the atmosphere of the classic fy_iceworld of CS1.6 in a de_ map with some uniques ideas, like an intrusion \r\ndetection systeme on one of bomb spot and a blizzard. I take my inspiration in some COD map and movies for make an coherent map.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version of the map is an alpha non textured map with some bug but totally playable.\r\n\r\nThe map is only make with wall and entity require for the final gameplay. (decoration object will be add in textured final version)\r\n\r\nYou can play with bot if you want. But the bot reaction is very stupid in some case (like rush only middle)\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: for installation, a txt file is in the zip\r\n\r\n/!\\MAP BY DIABL0/!\\"
