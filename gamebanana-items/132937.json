This will be the final version of this redux. Hope you guys enjoy it and thanks for the support.\r\n\r\n*********************!!!!!**********************\r\n*********************!!!!!**********************\r\n*********************!!!!!**********************\r\n\r\nEDIT #1: Working on a better and more optimized version. It seems that 64+ player servers will experience FPS lag when on the tower. New version will be uploaded when it is fully tested on a 64 man server.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n+ Removed a lot of the railing brushwork which was causing fps lag.\r\n+ Broke up func_detail brush work so it wasn't one huge func_detail.\r\n+ Added a lot of hint/skip and removed some unnecessary areaportals.\r\n+ Removed some excessive lighting.\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: I love the classic zm_towers but I decided it needed a face lift and this is the result. Please let me know your thoughts! :) Thanks!"
