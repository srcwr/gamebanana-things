This is simply a beta version of the map to see what people think of it and the way I set it up.\r\n\r\nI changed the lighting signifactly from the origonal cs_militia map, I made it much brighter since shadows don't matter as much in dm.\r\n\r\nI know that the map has cs_ in it, which generally means a hostage rescue scenario, but that is not the case with this map, I removed the hostages and the hostage rescue zones from the map in order to make it better for the dm mod.\r\n\r\nHere's also a video that you can watch to preview the map:\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YAQCygl4KNk&hl=en\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YAQCygl4KNk&hl=en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>\r\n"
