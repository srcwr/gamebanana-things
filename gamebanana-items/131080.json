	"_sText": "Hi this is my zombie escape map set in the Umbrella Corp HQ and their research lab! its up to beta 2 already! had to make some changes to some doors that were bugged. | beta 3 mor fixes D:\r\n\r\nLatest version b4. Fixed buyzones. Changed properties of some of the props so they can be used as barracades now!\r\n\r\nb5 fixed elevators so they can go back down\r\n\r\nb6 added some more graphics and a camera to the end of the map. fixed elevator bug (thx to Glad its all over, Crazeman and Crack Spider for testing!).\r\n\r\nOptimized graphics abit and fixed the zombies in stacis tubes. \r\n\r\nb7 - added teleporters under lifts for people who are glitched out. added stairwells next to elevators so people can bypass them. doors to the stairwells open automatically soon after the elevator is used. made the doors to the research lab more noobproof.\r\n\r\nb8 - fixed elevetor 4and 5 where the doors would shut but not move. Added more time between elevators moving and stairwell doors opening to give humans a better chance"
