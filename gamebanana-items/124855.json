	"_sText": "Port of my most recent map bhop_distilled. There are some changes in velocity for the boosters because CS:GO is garbo when it comes to boosters, so if you routed it on GO expect some slight route changes on this version. Fixed the booster in start of map from the CS:GO version. Tell me if there is anything wrong with the map so i can update it asap."
