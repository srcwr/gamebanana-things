Also added two more spawn\r\npoints for a total of 34 spawn points.\r\nAlso included a nav file.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a map I created for my gg server.\r\n\r\nNote: Nothing fancy here.  No arches, rounded corners\r\nor anything that would hinder fps.  This map was built\r\nas simple as possible to promote a high quality of\r\ngameplay but yet tried to give the map an appealing\r\nside also.\r\nStrategically placed crates and designed for close quarters\r\ngameplay and also a few sniping spots.\r\n\r\nI did a test run on my server and players really liked the\r\nway they were able to maneuver smoothly and freely from\r\none area to another.  Makes for a fun round of fragging.  \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOpen to all constructive criticism.\r\n"
