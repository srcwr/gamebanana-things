All of them balanced.\r\n- Volumetric lighting and cubemaps for you eye candy lovers.\r\n- Featuring a \"foggy morning\" sunlight setting, for ambience.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, glitch-free.\r\nI hope you like this map and do not hesitate to flame me if you find this map stupid!\r\nMaps will keep coming from Marioâ„¢ and me, so stay tuned!"
