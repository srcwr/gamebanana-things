	"_sText": "<h1>DE_CONVENT_PRO by Palrom</h1><hr>Detailed and improved version of the map for CS:S. There were so many changes  that it can't be called a simple update. The map inherited several features from CS:GO, new unique models, got its own soundscape script, optimized grass, beautiful 3D skybox, modified lights and much more. Weak PCs may slightly lose fps compared to the original version. Have fun!"
