	"_sText": "GG_Resol_Gz3_1 Map Info\r\n\r\nSize: Larger maybe even big \r\nBots: Nav file included. \r\nSpawn Points: 12 for each side \r\nDiscription: T and CT spawn in Different rooms which mirror each other and have 2 Hallways to get each other.  These hallways are large and long with both Flash and Granade. \r\nCreators Thoughts: I havent really tested this one with bots much.  I like the setup and the nad mechines but feel this map is just too big for a GG map.  Might make a good DM map.\r\nBugs: None I am aware of other then I could see people geting borad waiting for the last few players to find and kill each other, but that happens."
