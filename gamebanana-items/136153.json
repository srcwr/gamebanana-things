It is symmetric to provide an even battlefield for both sides.\r\n\r\nInside the what I will call the \"maze\" is a hidden trapdoor that contains a keypad. When the correct sequence is entered a single grenade will be dispensed. The bridge that stretches over the lava is actually breakable, so watch your step or you will fall into a death trap.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback on issues or problems surrounding the map."
