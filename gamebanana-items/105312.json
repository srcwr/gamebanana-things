Nothing will affect physical gameplay, but yes the fog glitches and yes it does snow inside the houses, i do know how to fix this but my computer doesn't like compiling and i cant be bothered to stop the snow. the fog i cant fix, i have tried but it has failed, sorry.\r\n\r\nYES there are buyzones, this works for both normal gameplay and gungame - without deathmatch enabled.\r\n\r\ni hope you like it this is a REPLICA of the AMERICAS ARMY map BRIDGE CROSSING.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nsuoiveD"
