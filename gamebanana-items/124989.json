If you notice any bugs on this map, please tell me and I will fix it in the next version.\r\nIn this map, you already born with scout, in stage 1, there's no difficult, it is easy and good for new \"bhoppers\", after stage 1, you'll go to a mini-xc and some bhop, after , a factory who is medium ( difficult ), and good designed. when you finish this stage, there is a hardened stage, but is really little. After you end the map, you will receive a cool awp.\r\n\r\nMap made by <b>Arroba</b>\r\n\r\n"
