You can access the level via tunnels in the walls, vents, skirting boards, under the bed covers, clambering over furniture and you can also snipe from the ceiling lights.\r\n\r\nUpdated \r\nAs requested I've added 2 bombsites; one in the computer and another at the CT spawn point blocked the terrors from sniping immediately an alarm sounds when someone enters the main lights to snipe CTs can now access the main lights via a tunnel on their side of the room more bridges/ladders (on all bed legs and shelves above computer) a few small objects on the floor for cover some minor audio & visual improvements Hopefully it should be a bit more enjoyable to play now :)"
