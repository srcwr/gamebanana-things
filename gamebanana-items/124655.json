If you don't like fun then you'll enjoy this map.<br><br>Difficulty: Literally barely possible, if possible at all<br>Length (Perfect Run): 1 to 2 minutes<br>Length (Casual): At least 5 minutes, maybe even 10+ minutes.<br><br>I'm fairly certain it is not even possible, but maybe somebody out there will finish it.<br><br>Update: renamed to bhop_challenging because bhop_challenge was already taken."
