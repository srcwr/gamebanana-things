	"_sText": "This is a remake of surf_ny_resistance; which was a homage to the original surf_rebel_resistance by ArchAngel. The map is 100% scratch built, but the borrowed themes and design are obvious. The idea was to have a similar design, but give it a quicker gameplay with more surf options. \r\n\r\nThe map has a small problem with people camping jail once they have won. This is common with this surf maps with a terminal jail, but that is no excuse. There are a bunch of secrets, which is against my usual anti-secret creed. The map is not lit.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nVisit solidsurf.info for our mapping forum\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI had uploaded the wrong bsp earlier. I apologize for the buggy version."
