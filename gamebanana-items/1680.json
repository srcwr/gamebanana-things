	"_sText": "This is just a little prefab I made for ZM. It's basically a building with a little window but zombies can't get in. You press the button and the roof lifts up so you can go in then you can shoot out the window at zombies. It's a very risky camp spot though because after 60 seconds the button is useable once more and zombies can come get you."
