	"_sText": "Devious Methods is a Counter-Strike:Source defusal map set in an industrial storage facility. A team of terrorists has infiltrated the base, intent on disrupting their foreign enemies at any cost. A team of counter-terrorists has been dispatched to protect the facility and to eliminate the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\nThe map is built for teams of 5 or more. It easily supports 16+ players and encourages organized teamplay above other maps. The map is built in such a way that no matter where you are, youâ€™re never safe from attack. Most locations in the map that give players an advantage over one location are vulnerable from another. This forces players to be vigilant, and to stick together to cover each other.\r\n\r\nGameplay is a mix of short- and long-range combat, though rifles seem to serve players better overall. There are plenty of sniper spots and flanking opportunities.\r\n\r\nFor comments or questions email cesig.moreis@gmail.com.
