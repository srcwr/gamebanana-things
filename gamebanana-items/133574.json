	"_sText": "Well, i'm pretty sure you know were to put counter strike source maps so i'll just give you the low down on it. This is my first ever attempt of making a counter strike source map, i just called it a gg map because it dosn't have buy zones.\r\n\r\n i was wondering if someone could do me a favour and take screenshots for me, my computer has very shit performance so the quality of the images as you can see are crap, oh and don't expect high quality mapping here, but its still pretty fun because of the various 'death' things around the place.\r\n\r\nwell thats about it, i hope to get some feedback because i wont to hone my skills alot, as you can see if you download the map, ahahaheeehoohweehaaa... aheeem, anywho. thanks for bearing with me. If you want me to, i can put up the pic of my sketched out planes, yes thats right, i sketched out plans so i knew what i was doing, if anyone request for them to be up i'll get on doing that!\r\n\r\nOH, IF ANYONE WANTS TO, YOU COULD ASK FOR THE VMF FILE, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW THIS MAP WOULD LOOK WITH GOOD DETAIL, SO IF THERE IS ANY GOOD MAPPER OUT THERE AND HAS SOME SPARE TIME, PM ME!"
