The Box's are sized according to their class be it pistol, shotgun, smg, rifle, machine gun, or item.\r\n\r\nThe spawners are designed so that weapons cannot be taken from them when the lid is closed giving a realistic feeling weapon box.\r\n\r\n\r\n/////////////////////USAGE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nPart one: \r\n--------------\r\nArmory mode and spawner mode.\r\n\r\nThese weapon spawners can be used to replenish their supplys per opening or used as armourys by making it so the lid never closes.\r\n\r\nIn hammer set the \"Delay before reset\" in the properties of the lid of your box to -1 so that the lid only opens once and never closes. \r\nAlternatively go into the outputs tab in the lids properties and delete the \r\noutput \"Onfullyclosed\", \"Weaponname\", \"Kill\" \r\nand in the output \r\n\"Onopen\", \"T_Weaponame\", \"Forcespawn\" to only fire once.\r\n\r\nThe alternative measure will cause an unrealistic effect when the box closes though because weapons can be grabbed from inside the box while its closes, to prevent this effect its wise to also set the delay before reset to -1, and in the flags tab check the toggle box so that the lid can still be closed if need be, however weapons can still be granned from inside.\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nPart two:\r\n---------\r\nResizing the boxs.\r\n\r\nThe boxes can be resized by simply editing the dimensions of the sides to whatever size you want longways sideways and upwards. Then select the displacement inside the box (The hay) And stretch that to fit the box. You will need to do the same with the lid of the box.\r\n\r\nTo reshape the hay if it looks weird, go to the face edit tool (it has a blue red and green face on it in the tool bar).\r\n-Click the top of the hay\r\n-Go to the Displacements tab\r\n-Click paint geometry\r\n-Use mouse1 to rise the hay and mouse2 to lower it)\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPart three:\r\n-------\r\nAdding additional weapons.\r\n\r\nAfter resizing a box it might be a good idea to add more weapons to it, to do so just simply select a weapon already in the box and hold shift while dragging it, when you release mouse1 it will clone that weapon which will already have all the material needed to spawn when the lid opens.\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPart four:\r\n---------\r\nParty boxs\r\n\r\nIt is possible to make different weapons all spawn from the same box, for instance if you wanted to make a box spawn an AK, 2 flash bangs, a He, a Smoke, and a Deagle then you could do so by simply placeing all the items in the box. \r\n\r\nThen Go into properties of each weapon and make sure they are all named the same thing.\r\nEG: AKpartybox\r\n\r\nThen in the Point_template sitting above the box go into its properties and select template 1 and enter the name AKpartybox\r\n\r\nThe point_template should already be named and working when the lid opens, but if you wish to rename it then you must also select the lid and edit the outputs.\r\n\r\nFor instance the output\r\n\"Onopen\", \"T_deagle\", \"Forcespawn\" should be changed to something like \"Onopen\", \"T_AKpartbox\", \"Forcespawn\"\r\n\r\nNo matter what the output\r\n\"Onfullyclosed\", \"Weapon\", \"Kill\" has to be changed to \r\n\"Onfullyclosed\", \"AKpartybox, \"kill\".\r\n\r\nThis way weapons can't be grabbed when the lid closes, and when the lid reopens it won't spawn weapons inside weapons.\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nPart five:\r\n-----\r\nRetexturing the resized boxes\r\n\r\nThe best way to do this is use the face edit tool and just click fit on the four sides and the top. There are 4 extra faces which are part of two side pieces. If you want to make these fit in then you need to select the middle side face and click fit, then apply, then use the x and y axis toggle bars to move it to a good postion, then use mouse2 on the faces next to it to make it seem like one face.\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nPart six:\r\n------------\r\nEditing Secondary Ammunation.\r\n\r\nIn properties of a weapon go to smart edit and click add value.\r\n\r\nName the value Ammo and for the value put the amount of ammo you want.\r\n\r\nEG:\r\nWeapon_m249\r\nAmmo 800\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nThese Weapon spawners were inspired by tophatwaffles works including the hay effect used in BA_jail_xtreme_uprise, and his Grenade box.\r\n\r\nYou can veiw more of his works at http://www.tophattwaffle.com/\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\r\nThe original TGA files for the texutures have been added if improvements wish to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
