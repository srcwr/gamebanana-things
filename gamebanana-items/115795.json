	"_sText": "Ok, this is a new type of map, a new game play, and one I hope to make preety popular. It's called Deer Hunt. The point of the game is for the deer (Terrorists) to kill the hunter (counter-terrorist) and make it over to his side before the round starts over to steal some weapons for an advantage for the next round. It might sound crazy, but give it a try. There is an invisible wall keeping the deer and the hunter from shooting at eachother when they spawn - to open this wall, press one of the buttons, they are preety easy to see as they stand out. I have ideas on a fort one, where deer start outside the fort and the hunter is inside, and the deer must get in the fort and steal the weapons. \r\n\r\nHave fun and leave feedback.\r\n\r\nOh and one more thing, could I somehow get my own category is I keep making these kinds of maps? Such as Fight Yard and Prepared Assault maps did?"
