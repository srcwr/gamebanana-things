	"_sText": "This is Version 3 of de_apathy, my Third ever FPS Map. There will be bugs, there will be newbie techniques. Provide constructive, helpful criticism and help me get better. A full list of changes is availible in the Readme.\r\n\r\nde_apathy is a Spiritual Successor to my Second Map, de_supercede. During production of the Third Beta, the Map-File became corrupted. I didn't feel like replicating the Map again, so I took the theme and expanded on it, making it better than I could of possibly imagined.\r\n\r\nThis map was made entirely by me, Nexolate. Special Thanks go out to Woo, who taught me the basics of Portalling, and my other Beta Testers for helping discover the obvious bugs. You may not copy, edit or redistribute this Map without my explicit permission.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated Version added with a small fix. Redownload if you want access to the Hidden Easter-Egg Area."
