It bears mild resembelance to cs_italy, very much in the T-spawn in the house, and also some in the building surrounding the map. It is very small and action starts right from the second you start the round. It's good for large amounts of players or just you and your friends on LAN servers, I made it and I know i'm being a bit biased, but trust me when i say its the most intense, fast played and camper unfriendly map since fy_poolday. it's the cat's pyjamas baby, merry christmas or happy hannuka \r\n\r\nif you have any mapping requests, contact me on \r\nsteam :   katteneleger\r\nGmail  :   kamikaze.fallafel@gmail.com"
