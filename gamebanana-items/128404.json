Inclusive a relaxing and carefree spawn with nice accordeon music and around the map are like 10 easter eggs.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">Additional Information</b><br></font></legend>\r\nThe file itself (.bsp) is quite big, we're talking 180mb. Not only does this map have a lot of custom content (models/materials/..), also 10 songs were added. I strongly recommend using fastdownload since the bz2 file will only be around 80mb.\r\n\r\nA detailed list of songs used in the map can be found <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/XT1bFHmX\">here!</a>\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt took me a while to make this map, I started end december 2013.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><font size=\"3\"><b class=\"blue\">A sincere thank you goes to these lovely people:</b><br></font></legend>\r\n<font size=\"3\"><ul><li><b>[SG] Paul</b> - Great advice and offering his server to test.\r\n</li><li><b>Tomgreen</b> - Level advice and giving me the waterlab idea.\r\n</li><li><b>zaCade</b> - Amazing guy who helped me out a lot, especially at the end.\r\n</li><li><b>Cuniczek</b>- Made the lovely counting system.\r\n</li><li><b>Steamgamers.com</b> - Beta testing and simply the best MG server\r\n\r\n</li></ul></font></fieldset>\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish, this was my latest map for CS:S. I started mapping back in 2008 and ever since oaks laboratory was released, I became addicted to mapping. Life changed now, got pretty busy and don't have a lot time left. \r\n\r\nEnjoy this latest map and let me know how you liked it :) <br><br>\r\n<b>Oak</b>"
