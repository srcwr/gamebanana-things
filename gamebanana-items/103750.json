	"_sText": "Rooftops is a bomb/defuse map. The plot is about 2 witnesses about to take the stand against a drug cartel. The Cartel plans on eliminating them using c4. Kind of like in \"Traffic\" when the guy says, \"I want to use a bomb. You shoot a guy in the head and they have doctors keeping him alive.\" So 2 penthouses in the witness protection program are under attack, and it's up to the counter-terrorists to stop the terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe map features:\r\n\r\n2 large bombsites\r\n64 spawn points\r\nVERY tall buildings\r\n\r\nI hope you're not afraid of heights!\r\n\r\n*note* - When you fall you get teleported back to the top.  You still die, but this makes it to where the bomb will teleport as well, so the T's won't get screwed if the bomber falls.  Not great for realism but great for gameplay."
