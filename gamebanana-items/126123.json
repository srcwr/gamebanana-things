	"_sText": "Hello again fLume here with bhop_stronghold, This is my 3rd map made for legit hop and easy hop alike this can be played in any gamemode so feel free to send it to any server you like! This map is minecraft themed mainly centered around a general stronghold from minecraft feel to it. Although it is minecraft i did not make it vanilla, there are blocks that are cut/less than scale. Has a great deal of climb and bhop in it fun for the whole family. If you hate climb dont worry! there are no anti prespeed triggers so grind to your hearts content. The map is the stronghold part and it has a \r\n**-BONUS MADE OF CLOTH THIS IS NOT PART OF THE MAP THIS IS A BONUS-**\r\nthe bonus as you will see is inspired by bhop_yonkoma and is NOT PART OF THE MAP its just a bonus. Feel free to put the end zone right after the first teleport. As always if you have any problems with the map just message me on steam or here and I will fix it as soon as possible."
