	"_sText": "This map is a modification of the original GoldSrc 2Fort from Team Fortress Classic, retextured and modified for gun game. It is only the bridge and the 2 forts.\r\n\r\nDue to my converting the GoldSrc version of the map to a Source-compatible .vmf there are quite a few small leaks in some of the brushes, a lot I have fixed. Nothing bad and not too noticeable unless you look for them. I will try to fix some of these in future updates.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW VERSION RELEASED. http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/76352"
