Happens quite often.</p><p>I made most of the map on stream (http://twitch.tv/dreeeaam), check out some of the past broadcasts if you are that interested in watching me make this. I plan to do more streams with more maps for the future but my internet is not stable so the viewers do not have much enjoyment from it.</p><p>NOTE: the start is where you spawn, when you reach the \"go back\" section, you turn around and go back through the map a little. Just trying to experiment with some new gameplay that has been used a lot recently.</p><p>I will try and make my next map textured, I have been trying a &nbsp;lot recently to use realistic textures but my style of mapping just makes it really difficult for me.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
