Lying around \r\nin the dusty pockets of my old HDD I have \r\nressurrected it and completely remade it from \r\nscratch using basic layouts of the old map.\r\n\r\nNow with Hl2 I have built the map up again\r\nusing the basic structure of the old map I had.\r\nNoticable difference, if not so obvious to \r\nmake the map look like an archive. Most\r\npeople thought it was a Goldeneye remake.\r\n\r\nSo delve into the deep unknown map which is\r\nDE_ARCHIVE\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n\tI dunno... The terrorists don't like\r\narchives, reading or paper. Man, I hate paper so\r\nbad!\r\n\r\nnotes:\r\n \r\nThe mp3 radio station will disappear if you leave \r\nthe radius of it. No idea why, there's no fix without\r\nchanging it to a 45 meg wav file :]\r\n "
