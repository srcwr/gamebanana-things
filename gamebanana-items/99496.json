The strong winds \r\nhowl around people who trespass on these hallowed grounds.  Some terrorists have \r\ncaptured some prominent scientists and are try to extort large sums of money for their safe return.\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n------------\r\nCT Team: Move swiftly to the other side of the map & enter the ancient mountain fortress to rescue the hostages from their jail cells. Then take them safely to the \"Knight's Temple\" or \"Alter of Time\".\r\nTerrorists: Your objective is to keep the CT team out of your fortress.  Kill them all!\r\nNote: This map has 6 medical boxes & the \"Alter of Time\" which will heal you. They respawn after 75 seconds.\r\n\r\nTitle\t\t\t: Ancient Arctic Ruins\r\nAuthor\t\t\t: Redclaw\r\nRelease Date\t\t: August 6, 2008\r\nFile name\t\t: cs_ancient_arctic_ruins_v1.bsp \r\nIM/Email Address\t: tachyonrays@hotmail.com\r\nWebsite\t\t\t: http://home.comcast.net/~redclaws/\r\nMax Players\t\t: (32) 16 vs. 16\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n------------\r\nBy way of introduction, I am \"Redclaw\" and I have spent the last 4 years mapping for AVP2. I also served as a map reviewer for PlanetAVP. \r\nAbout 6 months ago I jumped in the Half Life 2 and CounterStrike arena feet first. It's been a total blast and I love the HL2 world. \r\nIf play AVP2 and would like to check out those maps please PM me.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUnzip the files cs_ancient_arctic_ruins_v1.bsp:\r\nSteam\\Steamapps\\<>\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\\\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n------------\r\nChanging the map name from \"cs_ancient_arctic_ruins_v1.bsp\" to anything else will cause\r\nall the special visual effects (specularity) to stop working as the cubemaps have been compiled \r\nfor this map filename only. Basically the map will look like crap if you change it's name.\r\n\r\nHL2 Deathmatch Maps by Redclaw:\r\n------------\r\n\r\ndm_larkhill_detention_cntr_V1.bsp\r\ndm_narnia_hunting_grounds_v5.bsp\r\ndm_forest_vendetta_V1.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_Vendetta_snow_V3.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_vendetta_sun_v3.bsp\r\ndm_arctic_vendetta_war_se_v1.bsp\r\ndm_narnia_llw_winter_storm_v1.bsp\r\n\r\nCounterStrike: Source Maps by Redclaw:\r\n------------\r\ncs_forest_inssurection_v1.bsp\r\ncs_ancient_arctic_ruins_v1.bsp\r\n\r\nCredits:\t\t\r\n------------\r\n\t\t\t: Custom skybox texture by Robert Briscoe, changes by Redclaw\r\n\t\t\t\t* Make sure to checkout Robert's amazing de_forest map.\r\n\t\t\t: Custom tree models by Stene, skin changes by Redclaw\r\n\t\t\t: Custom blended textures & med box skin by Redclaw\r\n\r\nThanks:\t\t\t: Chizbone for suggestions & pointers on the NAV mesh, & all the people that give me feedback on my maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Notes:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me (tachyonrays@hotmail.com) with suggestions and bugs you might find in my maps.\r\n\r\nI run a dedicated server called \"Redclaws Dedicated Source Server\", please come join anytime.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n* COPYRIGHT/PERMISSIONS *\r\n<hr>\r\nAuthors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels.\r\n\r\nYou MUST NOT distribute this level UNLESS you INCLUDE THIS FILE WITH\r\nNO MODIFICATIONS. \r\n"
