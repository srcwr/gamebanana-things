I used less cubemaps and more nodraw textures than in the original version for reducing its data usage. I provided a story for everybody who cares.<br><br><i>In a metro station for the transport of dangerous materials close to a power plant a group of terrorists captured hostages and locked them in a main area of the place. The hostages do not have any protection against the radiation so hurry and free them before they wither away.</i><br><br><b>Planned changes (ratings &gt; 6)</b><br>•minor texture improvements<br>•major texture additions and fixes<br>•soundscapes<br>•better 3d skybox<br>•balance fixes if required<br><br>I hope you enjoy it ^~^<br><i>[it could be used as a fight yard as well]</i>"
