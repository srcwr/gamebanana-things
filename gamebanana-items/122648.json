	"_sText": "This is a bit of a tribute map to surf_greatriver, my favorite map. It has a similar flow and has some obviously similar attributes. it has more ramps and is faster though, and emphasizes surfing more than sniping. It is playable by all skill levels, but it takes a bit of practice to get to the bombsite on top of jail; it was added to truncate long rounds.\r\n\r\nvisit solidsurf.info"
