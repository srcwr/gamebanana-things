Take a break from all the dull \"texture only\" aim maps that flow out these days and play a *real* aim map, brought to you by r0ze.\r\n\r\nMap takes place in a dark \"secret\" plant of some sort that terrorists have captured. The terrorist room has a pit with water and a couple places for cover. The counter-terrorist room has lots of crates and plenty of cover. The second grated floor (reached either by crates or ladder) has vents that lead to the other room.\r\n\r\nMap is pretty small so not recommended for many players."
