	"_sText": "//EDIT: I have added a .nav file to the .zip file, so that you can practice with bots. The are some minor bugs in the nav file, but the bots do their job as they should mostly.\r\n\r\nThis \"story\" takes place in a random place, random scene. It's a fairly small map, but there are enough places to go to. There are no AWP's in this map, nor para's, nor autosnipers. Players will spawn on two sides of a window (ct's on one side, t's on the other side). They will be able to see eachother, but not to shoot eachother.\r\n\r\nI have set the \"max players count\" to 48, because there are 48 spawn points. The map will be the most fun when you play it with not more than around 24 players though, I guess. Bigger servers (32 man) can use it, but it may get a bit crowded. I haven't tested it with 32 players though, so you never know.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy my map. Please post feedback! :)\r\n\r\nInstall instructions:\r\nExtract the fy_lively.bsp file to your ...\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps folder."
