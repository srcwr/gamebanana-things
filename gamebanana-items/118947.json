I, and a few other members were asked to create a custom awp map for the server.  a few weeks later, I have finally finished the map. \r\n\r\nThe fog is a little heavy at times but not bad enough to effect game play.  You can still see perfectly to the other side from either spawn and it fixes to be a fun map with any amount of players."
