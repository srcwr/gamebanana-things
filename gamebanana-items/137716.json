	"_sText": "Dr. R Cade has kidnapped the famous arcade machines of history, distorting their levels for his own pleasure and gain. Enter his world and save the arcade machines from their cruel fate.<br><br>surf_arcade is my submission for the Fall 2020 KSF Mapping Contest. The map sees the player surf through a variety of retro arcade-style environments each with their own unique surfing style. The map is my take on the theme of \"adventure\" and is my fifth full-release project for surf. The map is tier 2 with plenty of skips as well as a bonus. A big thanks to the judges and the KSF owners for putting this contest together, as well as the KSF community for contributing to the generous prize pool. I hope you enjoy the map as much as i enjoyed making it :)<br><br>3500 maxvel, tier 2"
