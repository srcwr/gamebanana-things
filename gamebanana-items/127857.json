	"_sText": "A mini game where you spawn with a knife and a target box and you try to eliminate the other team using teleports. Aim your box onto an enemy or a friendly then right click with your knife and it will teleport them in front of you. You can use this system very tactically to gang up or snatch weak enemies, or you can use it to save your teammates out of a fight they are going to loose. Many different tactics are possible using this teleport system and experience with it does matter. Its a lot of fun if you know how to use it. [REMEMBER Right Click to teleport anyone touching your target zone] Set up for 10v10. Please comment on how the game play is and rate it if you enjoy the map. Thanks to Tran for testing the map with me."
