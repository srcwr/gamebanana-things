	"_sText": "This is my gungame sewer arena map. Yay.\r\nThis also happens to be my first map. I picked up hammer for the first time about a week prior to this map's release.\r\nDon't think that's a reason to go light on it though, if you see a problem, tell me about it. It's the only way I'm going to keep getting better.\r\nThe arena was designed for gungame, but it works great for a normal Csunter Strike game, Battle Arena, and single weapon games (grenades only/knife fights/etc).\r\nThe two teams spawn in opposite rooms, separated by a center chamber. Below the rooms is a sewer system that connects to each of the spawn rooms, and the center chamber. Above, there is a balcony, also connecting the spawn rooms and looks down on the center room."
