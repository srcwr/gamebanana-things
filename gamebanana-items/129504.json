	"_sText": "Pistol spawns random jail every round.\r\nDoors open 1 min after spawn.\r\n\r\nSo after CS:S update I decided to fix 418 missing textures in my map, however I edited map even more and now its more like remake. I did not add anything big just 1 secret and few new areas, and 1 extra vent.\r\n\r\nI may or may not release later the old version with fixed textures.\r\n\r\nI hope this is the final, but If you have some suggestions, I would like to hear them.\r\n\r\nOld version: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/64389"
