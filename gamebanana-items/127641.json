So you can just create a server on this map to create the .nav file! Please send any glitches/bugs/suggestions to me at hybodo@yahoo.com for this map thank you. Doesn't work well with BOTS better for online gameplay. You DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO RE-UPLOAD THIS ANYWHERE! I don't care if you give me credit or not, you can't upload it anywhere else."
