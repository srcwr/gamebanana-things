I'll be compiling the true final version in about a week, after taking suggestions and acting upon them.\r\n\r\nThis is still a fully functional surf map, with 4 levels and 1 finish. All players spawn with an m3 (pump shotty) and a knife in the spawn-kill proof spawn area (see screenshot D). The surf ramps resemble a double helix which span 4 areas. Mayhem and fragging ensues on the ramps and the jail.  Players are teleported to jail with weapons and locations equivalent to how far they got, heres that list:\r\n\r\n<div>Fail on first level - Bottom of jail with only knife.\r\n\r\nFail on second level - 2nd tier of jail with glock and knife.\r\n\r\nFail on third level - 3rd tier of jail with deagle and knife.\r\n\r\nFail on fourth level - 4th tier of jail with m4 and knife.\r\n\r\nBeat fourth level - Top of jail with Awp and knife.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAlso included (in the bspzip, only one file ;P) are some custom decals I made for the spawn. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"
