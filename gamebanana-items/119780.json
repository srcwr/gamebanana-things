	"_sText": "This is my first jail map. There are a couple of secret passages and stuff... And a pool.. I also like the control room, from where you can see all the cells and control the cell doors and other doors. But the map is definitely not finish yet. I have only tested it with bots.. And they are not very good at jail maps.. :P But I would like to see it used on a jail server.. So if anyone uses it, please let me no, because I would like to see it in action. :)\r\n\r\nThe map is basically 32 players, but there are a lot more spawnpoints in case you want to play with lots of terrorists and few counter-terrorists or the other way round.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 2009-03-18: Added some stuff to the map. Check it out!"
