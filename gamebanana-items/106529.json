I know the textures aren't great!\r\nBut to be honest, the reason why everybody loves aim_ak_colt is because of its simplicity.\r\nExtract the .RAR File to your cstrike folder within your steamapps. There is also a .NAV for BOTs!\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nCredits to: [DnV]Cross for bringing the original aim_ak_colt from CS 1.6 to Counter-Strike Source to allow us to Create even greater versions!\r\nwww.hellclan.co.uk\r\n\r\nMade by : ]HeLL[ Kyanite"
