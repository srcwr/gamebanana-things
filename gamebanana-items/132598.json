It is very well optimized( which took at least 4 days to complete)I plan on releasing a cs_ version  in the near future.  There are a few secrets here and there, but I tried to go for detail, as much as possible for ZM. But anyways I hope you guys enjoy it. Feel free to post any bugs noticed or anything.\r\n"
