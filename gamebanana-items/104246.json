	"_sText": "Welcome to De_Tariqe!\r\n\r\nThis is a \"dust styled\" map with two bombsites.  I recommend 20 players, but it has up to 32 available slots, (16 Terrorist, 16 Counter-Terrorist), to play with.\r\n\r\nTerrorists-  Mission 1:  Destroy the supply area behind the Temple.  Mission 2:  Destroy the CT supply point, near the North-Eastern point of the map.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists-  Mission:  Prevent the Terrorists from destroying the Temple's supply area, and protecting your own supply area from destruction.  Eliminate all opposing forces.\r\n\r\nObviously, this map is quite self explanitory, but, you near folks love to have a little bit of a \"story\" to go with the woopdeedoo!  So there it is, kapeesh?  :)\r\n\r\nCREDITS:  I give full credit to the original designers of the \"dust arches\" for I did not make them myself in this map, and all original credits are implied.\r\n\r\nThank you to all testers!\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback as I would like my \"mapping\" skill to grow some what, and all feedback is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nEnjoy guys and gals."
