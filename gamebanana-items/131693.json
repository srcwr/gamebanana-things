	"_sText": "Ever feel like your zombie server could use a little change up?  This map is a visual breath of fresh air.  Plenty of camping spots all over the map to explore and try out.  No impenetrable spots (like 1 way tunnels with couches nearby), but plenty of difficult to attack spots.  It's a good sized map, but not too large or elongated, which tends to separate the action.  It's pretty open, so you should have a good amount of zombies in your view to shoot at and keep from getting bored.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ONLY A BETA VERSION, so any camping spots that are too vulnerable will get fixed in the next version, and I am open to any constructive suggestions for improvement.  But compliments are very appreciated too!\r\n\r\n***** Beta 2 is out ******  (trying to get this one archived)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/60344"
