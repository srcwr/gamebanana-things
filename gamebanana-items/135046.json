	"_sText": "A gimmicky map, intended for gun game, but probably usable in other modes.\r\n\r\n3 small rooms, with a large door seperating 2 the sides, across the center of each.\r\nThe door opens automatically for a few seconds, so you should take cover and shoot whatever you see.\r\nThen a few seconds with the doors closed to change position if you want, then open again. You can not go through the dorway during this period.\r\nSo think of it like a little shooting range where the targets move around between rounds.\r\n\r\nAfter 5 goes (one minute), the doors stay open, and you can cross to the other side to finish the other team off! (And get your knife)"
