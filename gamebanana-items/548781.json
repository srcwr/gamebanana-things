The changelog for this patch was written by Jess Cliffe on the CS forums.<br><br>This patch was supposed to be released in CS 1.6, but due to the fact that the weapon characteristics are hardcoded there, I released this patch for CS:S.<br><br>Note:&nbsp;This patch only works in singleplayer with bots or&nbsp;on custom server."
