	"_sText": "I just wanted to see what it would be like if counter strike was mad into a scary single player game. I think that half life 2 is better after putting this together. anyway if you want to try it out, just launch the map with no bots and like normal select which ever team and class you want to be. Then just go ahead and walk through the map. It should probably only take about 30 seconds to finish it. Even though HL2 would be better I still think that this is kinda scary but I know what should happen and when it should happen so I want to know what other people think about it. This will let me know if I am headed in the right direction if I decide to continue this on HL2. So remember leave feedback! Oh and btw you might need to have HL2 installed for the sounds to play in the level, I'm not sure about that though. There should be several sounds throughout the level though."
