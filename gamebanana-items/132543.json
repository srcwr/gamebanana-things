For this one I went to the actual house with a laptop and set about making this version the most accurate version yet.  Now the upstairs is much more realistic, the first floor is next to perfect, and even the basement approaches reality.  There are still fake areas and the map isn't 100%, but I don't have a blueprint, so sue me.  I also made a ton of custom map props such as mirrors so that the map would seem as real as possible.  There are also many new textures and decals to add to the feel.  I also extended the underground lab and added a new secret there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's about it.  If you like some of the stuff in the map such as custom props or texture, I have released a number of them already in the prefabs section, but if you want something you can't find, feel free to pakrat the map to get it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, Questions & Comments are appreciated.\r\n- NatalyaAF -</font>"
