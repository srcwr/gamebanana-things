Thanks to RuudVanPistolrooy for giving me permission to submit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>AUTHOR'S NOTES:</b>\r\n\r\nSo here's the latest WIP version of the map. I wasn't sure if I wanted to release this version of it, since it's still needing a serious last layer of polish and fixing up. However I think the map needs a last round of feedback before I go for a final.\r\n\r\n<u>Known issues:</u>\r\n\r\n- Some texture alignment bugs.\r\n- Model collisions.\r\n- Some of the models need re-skinning (remaking possibly, I pretty much suck at modelling still).\r\n- Totally unoptimised - FPS is shite in places.\r\n- Nav mesh is rough and dirty with no place painting.\r\n- You can escape from the map in some places.\r\n- Some z-fighting where the tree shadow overlays hit displacements.\r\n- Soundscapes appear broken in this build.\r\n- Some of the overlays are a bit crap.\r\n- Terrorists have more spawnpoints than CT\r\n\r\nAll comments and crits appreciated. I am pretty much set on the layout now, I just want to concentrate on making it look nicer and fixing bugs.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fragnbag.com\">http://www.fragnbag.com</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>EXTRA NOTES:</b>\r\n\r\n- The spawnpoints seem a bit messed up. Terrors have 13 as far as I coult tell, while Counter-Terrors only have 10. Still, the map is very playable.\r\n- Check out the previous version of this map here: <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/13148\">Click</a>\r\n- I included a bzipped2 version in the .rar, for easy use with fast download servers.
