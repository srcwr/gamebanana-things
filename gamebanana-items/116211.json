Also thanks to CJC0008 for inspiring me to make this map, and for beta testing.\r\n\r\nThere's also a hidden room to those of you can find it...assuming you don't cheat and just noclip to it.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n-Some minute creases in parts of walls and around ramps, unsure of how to fix.\r\n-Lighting error on the rock under the arch.\r\n-Button that opens the hidden room door is visible on the other side of the wall momentarily.\r\n\r\nPM if you find anything else, and be sure to tell me your thoughts."
