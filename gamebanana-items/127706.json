	"_sText": "This is my first mini game map so please be gently.  I took a bunch of prefabs and some ideas and made them into weapons inspired by spearwars.  You spawn with nothing and you grab an item(with a knife) and most likely, the front is the killer part trying to stab your oppenents.  But i must warn there will probably be TKing since people are idiots\r\n\r\nThanks Goes To:\r\n\r\nTomgreen(inspired to make this map)\r\nRed Ranger(beta tester and ideas)\r\n\r\nAnd everyones prefab\r\nMost of my weapons came from prefabs since im infact lazy (sorry D;)\r\n\r\n(If you really want specific thanks please message me and i will do so)"
