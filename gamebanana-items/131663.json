There's also kind of an advertisement in the swimming pool (CoreTemp); I've been allowed to put this as I asked from CoreTemp's creator.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secrets\r\n\r\nI hope you'll like it.\r\n\r\nPS: You must open the compressed folder with 7-Zip or any other software that handles .7z files."
