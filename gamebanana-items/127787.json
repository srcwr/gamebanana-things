	"_sText": "This is a remake of a zombie panic source map called barrelhunters I believe. There are 3 t's vs 29 ct's. The cts are disguised in a box which blends in with the other boxes in the map and their only weapon is touching the T with the box to kill them. The T's get to find guns scattered across the map to fend off the ct boxes, but they are limited on ammo so It becomes a reverse cat n mouse game. Alota fun once it gets going.\r\n\r\nMap made a while ago releasing now\r\nSet for up to 32 spawns\r\nPlease contact me before decompiling or using anything in here at Tomgreen's|Mini Game|Fast DL|Great Job server 76.73.27.235:27015\r\nand my steam id would be Tomgreen STEAM_0:0:7598918\r\nPlease leave comments on the map so I know if you liked it in order to work on simular ideas ect..\r\n"
