While I'm not classifying it as and Alpha or Beta, I wouldn't call it final. Anyway, It's a large room with OVER THIRTY spawn points for each team. All the players start out with their USP or Glock, their trusty combat knife, and, of course, a Benelli M3 12 gauge shotgun! The game is played until every tango's met your lil' friend...\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI first posted this eight months ago, and never corrected my problem of mistakenly posting a VMT file instead of an actual map file. I have now added it and more! I have since added proper lighting and upped the number of shells that you start with. Enjoy version 1.1 of Conduit!"
