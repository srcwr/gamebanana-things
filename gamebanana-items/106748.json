	"_sText": "This is a typical aim map.\r\nThe only difference is that on this map you've to play with deagles, unlike most maps similar to this which use AK47/M4a1.\r\n\r\nIt's my first map ever, used some tutorials and I came up with this.\r\nNot very original but I'm happy with what I made.\r\n\r\nOn the middle of the map, there's a couple of boxes, on the top of the last box there's a buyzone but it's not really going to affect gameplay that much because it needs two people to get up on the last box. One to sit down and the other one to get up so you'll never see a full team of bought items.\r\n\r\nLeave feedback and if you find any bug mail me @ NPExte@hotmail.com"
