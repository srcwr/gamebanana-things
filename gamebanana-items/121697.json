This may not seem like much, but the normal bathroom version crashed on deathmatch servers due to the weaponspawners. I already saw some decompiles fixing this, but this is my official release of the final.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a DM server, download this one: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/20733\r\n\r\nNo need to rate this, it has already been rated.\r\n\r\n-SmOoth"
