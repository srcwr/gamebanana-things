Open the RAR with a compatible program. (winrar, winzip, etc.)\r\n\r\n2. Copy the .bsp file included in the RAR file to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n3. Click create server and find the map OR open console and type map MG_ClimbingWars and it should show up then click on it and hit enter.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nI am too lazy to delete the area I started with currently so you can just noclip to the area of the level I used to test a few things. (Will be deleted next preview)"
