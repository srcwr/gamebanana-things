	"_sText": "Greetings to all. This is the first attempt at a target map I make. It is the second version of a map that I had previously completed but from which I decided to continue later. I tried to make it as complete as possible and at the same time develop it in a closed environment, since at the moment I still need to learn how to handle myself outdoors.<br>Other than that, the map is based on an abandoned house. It is dark, medium to large in size and has a basement and second floor.<br>Terrorists have taken the place to hold their prisoners. Counter-terrorists must intervene in their actions and end them by ambushing the building. The priority, beyond neutralizing enemies, is to safeguard the lives of hostages.<br>I hope my work is to your liking. Any opinion will be duly appreciated. From already, thank you very much!<br><br>Thanks to:<br>-LucasFacu for testing the map and helping me improve it.<br><br>-Patrick de Arteaga for providing me with the music present on the map.<br>(his music is free, visit his page if you like: https://patrickdearteaga.com/es/index-es/).<br><br>-Chesterfield, since from him I was able to get the hostage skins present on the map. The one who ported these skins to CSS was originally vad36. Credits to both for their respective actions.<br><br>NOTE: If you want to uninstall the hostage skins then go to the \"cstrike\" folder of the game, then go to \"custom\" and there delete the folder called \"my_custom_stuff\". If you already have any other modifications installed, then you have to delete the folders of the files individually:<br><br>-materials > models > player > Vad36Hostage (delete)<br>-models > characters (delete)<br><br>(Sorry if my english was not too fluent or clear)"
