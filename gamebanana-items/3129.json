K, 1 of 2 things. 1: I know the tv shows 4 different screens, it's my hammer, not my fault, so don't use it against the rating for this prefab. 2: You can change what it shows on the screen simply by deleting the fireplace and adding what you want there, or you can just make it nothing on the screen  D = but that seems pointless.\r\n\r\nCredits: I made the tv by going back to the living room to my computer multiple times, it's not perfect, but its not horrible. \r\n\r\nWapo made the fireplace, thank you very much for that!\r\n\r\nOther than that everything i made from scratch.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy, it took me a while so i hope it's worth it. If you have any comments, suggestions, etc...just either pm me, add it in the message box below, or add me to steam @ projektmayhem81.\r\n\r\nI hope you all use this in your next map/prefab, and i hope i get some positive feedback!\r\n\r\n| [F]ox |"
