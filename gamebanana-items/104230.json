I intended the map to be for human players only, tried adding bots but it was horrible.\r\n\r\nI tried to make a 'tactical map' by adding elevators (including a little trap door in the right elevator which a player can hide in), also in the warehouse I made a light switch that can be turned off to distort players.\r\n\r\nThere are a few more tactics but you'll figure them out by yourself, comments are welcome"
