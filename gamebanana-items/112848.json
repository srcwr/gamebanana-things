	"_sText": "This is version 3.2 of this map. I added some light and fixed a few textures. This time the download comes with two maps. The two maps have the same layout, but have different weapon options.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- fy_iceworld_2006_v32\r\n  All players spawn with the same random weapon. (no buy zone) This is what makes this map one of a kind!\r\n\r\n\r\n--- fy_iceworld_2006_v32_buyzone\r\n  Weapons are on the gound with a buy zone in the middle. Similar to the original fy_iceworld. (all weapons come with full ammo)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====EDIT======\r\nThe map that has no buyzone might crash your server after running it for about a hour. Now that GunGames mod is out this map is kinda useless. Look for fy_iceworld_midnight if your looking for a good iceworld map."
