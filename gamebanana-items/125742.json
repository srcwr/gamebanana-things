	"_sText": "I made this map because I find there arn't enough challenging bhop maps. It ranges from beginner to expert and has 4 long jumps in (including a ramp to long jump).\r\n\r\nThe setup if fairly cortroversal, you finish the map and you get to walk along the walls to taunt players who haven't finished. \r\n\r\nThere is no water involved due to an error in my hammer editor.\r\n\r\nThis took me around 7.5 hours to fully complete, including the txt file and failing at making a radar.\r\n\r\nExtract both files to steam/steamapps/username/counter-strike source/cstrike/maps\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a new bhop map, that is abit more 'twisted'.\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments and crit, I'm needing ideas of how to improve.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the map, and happy bhopping.\r\n\r\nJoelwade.\r\n"
