	"_sText": "Because i like small \"Fight Yard\" maps, such as fy_dustdm and fy_poolday_reunion, i decided to make a small map of my own, this map has mines scattered throughout the middle of the map, hence the name landmines. There are a total of 24 mines placed in hidden and unknown spots. These mines do not change positions. I find it fun to play because of all the explosions and stuff. I hope you like this map aswell. - Oxylon"
