The special attention was paid to both stairways between the first and the second floors.<br><br>\r\nWell... bots use all possible ways now and perfectly navigate with all map. They will watch you in twilight zones! :D<br><br>\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the alternative navigation file by Peter \"BarnDoor\" Calvert is also available to loading from his <a href=\"http://www.tequilakawa.plus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">homepage</a>.<br><br>\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also your responses for me are still important ;-)<br><br>\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\nHeyo (for nice futuristic industrial-themed map)<br><br>\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>\r\nSee You at the... Better Future for the Human Race :D<br>\r\n<br>"
