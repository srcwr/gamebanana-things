	"_sText": "This map was designed to be fast and quick, but with enough cover to not be totally visible to others.  The upper portion was added as a risk/reward device, the idea was if you are up there you have a total vision field for the most part, but this makes you visible to everyone else and the floors are designed so they can be shot through.\r\n\r\nUPDATED!  Now includes a slow rotating fan, Friend or Foe!?\r\n\r\nUPDATED!  Cosmetic choices added, should look much better\r\n\r\nUPDATED!   2.0 is here, same map, lots new additions!\r\n\r\nUPDATED!  No pics sry :(, however made some improvements that should make this map much better"
