	"_sText": "I believe I placed fifteen spawns for each team, but it might have been more. This is my second released map and I'm not quite sure what AIM stands for... but I didn't feel right sticking the gg tag on it. But This map is designed for gun game. Night Vision is recommended, because it gets real dark when the lights flicker off. Bots play well on it.\r\n\r\nLike my other map, most of the credit goes to TPSKJarhead for teaching me how to use hammer.\r\n\r\nAnother Big Thanks to the tutorial section of FPSB, really helped.\r\n\r\nThere are few glitches that I am aware of, but if you find any please point them out to me!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDeath's[one]Fear\r\n"
