	"_sText": "Inspired by the shit (yet fun) map, \"mg_smee_tower\" this is a much better made version with HDR enabled and a much more complex and detailed structure to the floors. The elevator has been better revamped for better tactical purposes. Play the fucking map.\r\n\r\nBasically, the Terrorist team spawns in the top floor of the tower and must defend it from the Counter Terrorists who will attempt to storm and take control of the tower by one of 3 routes.\r\n\r\nPs. There is enough space to accommodate 64 players, easily."
