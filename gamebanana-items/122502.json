For that I need some more testers, helping me to find bugs and improving my map. Any constructive feedback is welcome, excluding that the design is copied from BuckNasty.\r\n\r\nAt this point I need to say that I've already talked to Buck Nasty about the design sheme and it's textures. He helped me finding a new collection (thanks for that) which <b>I didn't use in this version yet </b>. So don't worry, it's gonna be changed on further versions.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who helped me with this map yet.\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- On the big half-cicled ramp you get stack sometimes but mostely it will work fine. (Most annoying)\r\n- Some spotlights, spawning under water, have some strange lighting errors.\r\n- Sometimes you don't get a knife, if you fell down into jail.\r\n- You can walk in the middle of the spawn (the wall) tought there are 2 trigger_pushes in 2 different directions (like one to the left, one to the right, if you stand in the middle you won't be pushed anywhere).\r\n- In the middle of the map, on the round platform, the push sometimes doesn't push you far enough (to jail).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nThis is a fast map with all its boosters and fast weapon spawners without pressing buttons anymore. Also you don't need to wait for somebody to help you, if you fall to jail, anymore, as you can simply walk away - but without weapons.\r\nAll ramps are smooth and can be surfed from both sides. Buyzone and \"secret\" shotgun are still included. The bomb-target activates itself after 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it and please post as much feedback as possible, whatever is in your mind.\r\n\r\nCheers, Krusty"
