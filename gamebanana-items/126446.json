Don't be a noob, play on a proper server with anticheat.\r\n\r\nThanks to getwrekt for starting this project and making the first bhop room (the one after the first easy climb room) and thanks to aoki for the textures and design.\r\n\r\nGood servers with anticheat:\r\n\r\nAus kz/bhop : 203.98.81.242:28015\r\n\r\nbox n' prox : 70.42.74.82:27015\r\n\r\nakb bhop    : 1.234.22.20:27015\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n\r\nOne particle effect has a missing texture for people with lines.pcf in their cstrike/particle folder, i think, very minor and barely noticable. Should only happen to 2 - 3 people.\r\n\r\nMight have to disable any weapon removing server addons to complete the map.\r\n\r\nmediafire link : http://www.mediafire.com/?l4hybb9lulckb00"
