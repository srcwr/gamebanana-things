	"_sText": "Awesome Opossum had this idea and sent an initial .vmf to me.  He was relatively new to map making, and his version was choppy, laggy, and confusing.  So I started anew, tweaked the design a bit, and built the thing.  It's completely symmetrical.  Each team's spawn point is divided into 4 levels and the bomb site is under the ramp in the center area."
