	"_sText": "        The map is in FINAL VERSION now, Just added an underground Cade Fortress, now with an extra room, fixed the vent leading to the room. I also added a climb room. and I improved the existing Cade room, I also improved a secret, and added a climb room, but otherwise this map is a duck jumping climb, mixed with cade map, it should be great for zmod and currently i am retrofitting it to work as a zhorde map so look for that soon. I also just added a navigational file so now bots can work on it to! Other than Zmod it is a fun pistol arena map. Thank you and please leave feedback"
