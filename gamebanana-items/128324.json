	"_sText": "- Many challenging traps, however many of these are already used in many maps. My idea was to remake them and make the more funny and challenging.\r\n- Every new round is playing different song out of 6.\r\n- Custom textures and models.\r\n- Custom 3D Skybox.\r\n- No exploits / bugs. (If you find one Pm me)\r\n- 3 Finishing rewards\r\n  - Points\r\n  - Gravity (applies in sewer level and its disabled for some places)\r\n  - Speed\r\n\r\n\r\n- Walkthrough: Thanks to [WeezyNL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLHUWP4O_tw \"WeezyNL\")"
