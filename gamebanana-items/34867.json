Reworked from scratch almost whole bombsite B.\r\n\r\nAdded place names, so bots will tell you where the enemy is, where the bomb, etc. As always, I recommend to run map without bots and learn how the place names arranged, and then have fun ;)\r\n\r\nUPDATE 24.01.15: Two hours of checking the NAV with bots. Fixed little less of ten places where the bots sometimes get stuck. Now bots very smartly using the beach near B (before they didn't use the beach absolutely), so they can do for you \"surpise motherfucker\" from rear of B ;D. Greatly improved passing through window near B.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 25.01.15: fixes of some jams including crates on the courtyard and stairs to B. Reworked window near B (and fixed the bug when bots never walking through window). Now bots (especially CT after beginning of the round) don't climbing to B by jumps on the gun, but by stairs what is much faster."
