	"_sText": "My Third Release Is...de_cubed\r\n\r\nConcept: I was watching a movie the other day(It Was Cube, Thank You Know Who You Are )  and the premise was they were imprisoned in a big prison with hundreds of identical rooms  the only thing was..there were traps in the room and you couldn't see if it was safe beforehand, so everytime you move to a next room it'd be a gamble for life or death.  Well it took that concept removed the traps and replaced them with Terrorists :\\\r\n\r\nGameplay: It's A de_ map what that means is that the terrorists\r\n\r\n*Notice*\r\n-Don't try and play this with bot's the thing about using func_illusionary is that bot's act as if it isn't there and as such will shoot you from across the map.  It can get a little scary playing 1v1 and your defending the bombsite and all of a sudden a dude pops out of the wall and blows you to smithereens.  \r\n\r\n -The sheet metal doors are solid the tiled ones on the outer rooms are not.\r\n\r\nAlso one last note, it's with regret that I say this is the second time uploading the map, the first time didn't work because the file was corrupt, I like to believe I've fixed the problem\r\n\r\n*For Installation Notes*\r\n-Read the readme."
