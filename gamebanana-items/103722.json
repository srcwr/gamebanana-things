	"_sText": "Welcome to my first ever map! I've tried to create a balanced, fast paced close quarters defuse  map for counter strike source. The map is based around two main buildings the larger of which links all levels of the map from three storeys above ground to two storeys below ground. Bomb site A is located underground whilst site B can be found on a balcony leading from the top floor office. I have tried to ensure balance and sufficient time to get from one site to another meaning there is always a final face off while the timer is ticking. I have spent a lot of  time tweaking bot navigation to ensure they use the map as intended. There are 12 spawns per side. All areas are named and contain ambient sounds. Please remember this is my first map so be honest to not too harsh with your comments, all feedback will be gratefully received. Hope you enjoy. Rick_0_Shay."
