	"_sText": "Its a wax museum I made from scratch. Post a reply if you like it. Uses a custom tile floor so if you don't change that don't forget to pakrat it the custom tile is included in the bsp if you don't want to separately download it. I created it for a map in progress I placed custom animated models inside along the ledges making it a wax museum that's why its called that. The bsp is in hdr to show and example of how the lighting effects all of these windows, and nearly every single texture reflects it so it makes for a very slick look with hdr on. Post a reply if you use it or like it just to let me know if I should make more of these in the future."
