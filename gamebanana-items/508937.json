In both, a single participant will spawn from their respective spawn, while the other participants will spawn behind the same room.<br><br>These same 2 rooms have a wall in front of them, the only difference between the 2 is that the CT Spawn contains a staircase and a balcony on the wall in front of it.<br><br><h1>Anything else to say?:</h1><br><span class=\"RedColor\">IF YOU PLAY WITH BOTS, ENTER THE MAP AND WRITE \"nav_generate\" IN THE CONSOLE.</span><br><span class=\"RedColor\">This way you avoid any problems that may occur with the navmesh and bots.</span><br><br>"
