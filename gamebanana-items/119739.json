	"_sText": "This is a small map, Yet fun map i created for my server.\r\n\r\nI noticed how people like simple maps like hiddens, So i decided to make a map like it. It contains a 80s disco, A kitchen, Ice skating area and a lock down for the gun room.\r\n\r\nI do know that some of the songs arnt loud in disco, That is because i ripped them off youtube and it's how they came.\r\n\r\nI got the kitchen idea of another Jail map, Which im unsure of the name right now but if you think you deserve credit, Please tell me.\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit this map, As long as the VersonoGaming text stays on the wall. If you would like to remove it, Please contact me for permission.\r\n\r\nWe've had the map running for a while now and it seems bug free, But if you do find a bug please do feel free to tell me or fix it yourself.\r\n\r\nThanks."
