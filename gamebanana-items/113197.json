	"_sText": "You + M249 + Grenade + Friends + Enemies = Fun\n\nTired of the constant grind of de_dust or de_aztec? Need to let off some steam, and unload 200 shots of 5.56mm into someone's face via the internet? Then fy_m249_fight is the map for you and your server.\nDesigned purely for fun, and to be a map to be played either in death match format, or as an intermittent map between \"serious business\" maps. \n\nNot intended to be played anywhere 24/7, except on Death match servers. If you use it on your server, please don't rename it as yours. I'm not even going to ask you to credit me. What we upload to FPSB should be for all. But I do hope that you would respect my wish to remove it from your server if I requested you to do so."
