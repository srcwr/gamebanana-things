	"_sText": "Im currently going thru a really bad divorce and Im giving up mapping. Anyway i wont be able to complete one of the longest projects ive created yet. I have spent years on and off working on this map and would love for someone with experience to complete it. Most of the models and almost every textures are custom and are embedded in the cs_hawahi_b1.bsp. Use vmex to decompile and you will have your cs_hawahi_b1.vmf to start working on it . This map doesnt need much just alittle time. Any questions email me noobsonly69@optonline.net  Thanks Silly"
