	"_sText": "This is a map I created as a tribute to one of the best Unreal Tournament maps, CTF-Face. It is not an exact replica, but the towers are very close. There is also an added basement for those who do not enjoy sniping. This map is designed for all out battle, sniping up top and close combat down underneath. Every weapon can be utilized on this map. It has been designed for up to 64 players, but not restricted to that.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map, and please relay any critisism, suggestions or adivce.\r\n\r\nAs well, feel free to suggest any ideas for future maps.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nDonut."
