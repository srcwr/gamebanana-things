If you survive that time you loose your weapons and get teleported to the space and lava room. You get a knife with a thruster that spews out brown smoke, it looks like fart, also low gravity there. You have to jump over the rocks to get the grenades and the Flashbang. Also the grenades and the flashbang have env_spritetrails on them!! (they leave trails of light on them)"
