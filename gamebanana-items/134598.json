	"_sText": "This is my first map release. I tried to make it a simple 3-path map with a little twist. All the walls in the middle of the map can be used for cover, but they are also breakable. The pit in the middle will kill you. :) I got the idea for this map while semi-dreaming about a fun gg map to make. I suddenly thought of a map based on the old Atari classic, Breakout.\r\n\r\n4 hours to create and compile.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Lost for the valuable input regarding my lighting. Now this map has HDR and cubemaps!\r\n\r\ncerberus/."
