His great tutorials saved me a lot of time.\r\n\r\nMake sure you check out the box maze, ducts and pop machines. ;-)\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\nWhen multiple players enter a teleporter at the same time, they will get stuck at the exit.  You can get out by crouch jumping repeatedly.  I wasn't sure how to fix this.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!"
