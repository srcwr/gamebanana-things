	"_sText": "Map inspired by the video game \"Frogger\". performed with the source graphics engine and a theme a little different.\r\n\r\n====objective====\r\nTry to reach the end of the 3 types of crossing streets, the difficulty will increase. The first road is easy, the second is medium, and the third is hard.\r\n\r\nThe end has to go by car to the end of the motorway, while you shoot the enemy team is on the other side. Try to shoot the car opposite and not yours, the car might explode.\r\n\r\nThere helicopters to which you can assemble and launch bombs to the opposing team. But to reach the helicopter could be difficult :).\r\n\r\n====Secret weapons====\r\nThere are 2 kinds of secret weapons, one for CT's and one for T's. The CT's have minigun. While T's have a rocket launcher.\r\nThe secret weapons have a limited use, can be used only one time, but are extremely powerful. If you get one, do not waste it, use it for last.\r\n\r\nThere is another secret, which does not speak anything :).\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map.\r\n(Sorry for my bad english)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFuChSS"
