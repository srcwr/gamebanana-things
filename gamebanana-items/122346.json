This reloaded map is in dust style and has the maximum at FPS-optimisation. I hope it works good on your PC. \r\n \r\nINFOS:\r\n------\r\nThis map has now only 14mb filesize. Ive added a new jail where you can play a knife-soccergame to escape. There are 3 healthpacks to get full health. And there is also a secret with a special weapon! \r\n \r\nCREDITS:\r\n--------\r\nMONKEYDIE - for the original map (thanks man this was the first surfmap ive ever played and learned howto surf *gg*) \r\nKRUSTY - for testing, bugreporting and additional help! \r\nALL PLAYERS AT MY SERVER! \r\n \r\n... a video will come properly soon - cya Rebell ;-)</div>"
