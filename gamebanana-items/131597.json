	"_sText": "This map is a cross between a regular barricade-building zombie map and a zombie escape map. Only you are not only running away from the zombies, but you are running away from the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThis is a reverse-zombie map. Instead of the typical \"try to get to the highest point away from the zombie\" gameplay style; in this map, you do the exact opposite, you try to get to the lowest point to avoid getting crushed.\r\n\r\nDepending on how long the round time is set on your server will determine on how many times the ceiling will come down to pummel the players. In a general 5 minute round time, the ceiling will come down twice.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nslowly descending ceiling for your pending doom.\r\na breakable raise-able wall activated by a button.\r\nseveral human-sided areas that are only temporary because of the collapsing ceiling\r\na breakable box wall that surrounds the CT spawn.\r\nseveral other unique rooms to challenge both zombie and human."
