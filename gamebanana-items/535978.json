	"_sText": "This is a map I had initially made and released about a year ago. Then, I made some changes and fixes to it, released it in an incomplete state again, then called it a day. It has been on the back of my mind since. So, I decided to fix up those issues and post it a third time. I know the map is extremely basic, but so is my Hammer skills so this was the best map I could make. It's a relatively small map compared to other Fight Yard maps, but it is fun playing with a few bots on it. I don't think many people will play this map, but for the few who actually want to check it out, enjoy."
