A MUCH Better version of my map cs_mount!\r\n\r\nCS_MOUNT2008\r\n---------------------------\r\nA Whole new look - improved textures and includes HDR lighting.\r\n30 spawnpoints\r\n4 Hostages\r\nSecret \"room\"\r\nBuyzone\r\nAnd lots of props.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrorists start from the upstairs or the basement. The hostages are upstairs and basement. CT:s spawn at outside. It isn't very big map - but even funnier with a small group. It's designed for small games and just for fun. The hostages may be a little grumpy.\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD NOW! YOU HAVE ONLY ONE LIFE ;)\r\n\r\nOh, almost forgot: Rate it! \r\n"
