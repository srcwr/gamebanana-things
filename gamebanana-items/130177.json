	"_sText": "GG_StrangeCastle_v2 is a remix of version one with updates. v1 was never uploaded but was on my personal server for a while before it got shut down. T and CT spawns marked by colored lights. From spawns you can go up to the roof of your castle, outside to a building in between your two castles, and downstairs to a basement that connects the two.\r\n\r\nthe map is Symmetrical and has more then 1 entry to each area accessible from multiple sides of most area's. It should also be FPS friendly as there is no un needed textures, i ran it with 27 bots and was still getting 300 fps which is my max so.\r\n\r\nThere are no secrets\r\nEnjoi"
