The Texture is by Chris528.\r\n\r\nThe map is made for my AWP NoScope Server but I'll release this to Gamebanana.\r\n\r\nYou're probably wondering why this is v6, simply because I'm working on the map for a long time and finally have a stable (not final) version, but still in development.\r\n\r\nAWP NoScope Server: 62.75.215.21:27015\r\n\r\nFeedback is desired. Have Fun!"
