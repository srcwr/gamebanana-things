	"_sText": "This is just an edit of my fy_mountain_home_mansion map.  I added some rain, cool effects, sounds, and made it a hostage rescue with different spawn zones.  The CT team gets two spawn areas, front and back of the house and T team gets basement and fireplace room to start.  And yes this is seriously version 100; from start to finish, I changed and ran this map about 100 times to perfect it.\r\n\r\n**EDIT IMPORTANT NOTICE**  I had to update this map due to an error caused by an invalid ct spawn point which at maximum occupancy will leave one player stuck into the ground!  If you downloaded this map before August 29, delete it and download it again!***********\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTICE NUMBER 2**  I have yet again updated this map on August 29, any user who downloaded on or before that date should delete the map and redownload!  It wasn't a big deal, just a simple texture misplacement!  I removed it and have fixed it now!"
