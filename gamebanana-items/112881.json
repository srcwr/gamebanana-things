Gladitorial 'to the death' combat of a new era, displayed on pay-per-view television. In a remote oceanic location towards the extreme southern hemisphere, an arena was built specifically for the purpose of this televised event. Nano-Camera Drones fly around, invisible to the naked eye, recording and sending all the graphic footage straight to the <b>Spectators</b> in real-time.\r\n\r\nDesigns of this specific arena were built to mimick the infamous 'iceworld skirmish of 1999'. This gigantic hunk of ice and metal is kept afloat by anti-gravitational orbs that float around the structure. The inner section of the arena is a pure reconstruction of the 'iceworld' and the outer limits are surrounded by guard towers to offer a strategic vantage point. Below the floating island are freezing waters of no return.\r\n\r\nThe <b>Terrorist</b> and <b>Counter-Terrorist</b> teams are in it for the money, with $300 awarded per kill and more for each round they win. With a supply of clones limited only by the show's demand, this arena is sure to be one bloody warzone.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is a bomb that can be planted next to the snowman in case a round gets dragged long. There is a second C4 up in the tower behind the CTs in case the first one is lost to the waters. There is once again a buy zone in the bombsite itself. Surviving winners get to stock up for the next round!\r\n\r\nAlso this thing isn't really meant to be played with 64 players (hell, who plays CS with 64 players short of zombie mods?) but the option is there with 64 spawns.\r\n\r\nAlso special thanks to TopHATTwaffle for his Realworldtextures2 pack (used for glass) and vanblam for his sci-fi texture pack (really cool textures)"
