	"_sText": "This map takes place on the peak of a mountain. Its a hideout for terrorists to stash their explosive and radioactive crap for their next attack. I made it evening time to make it more interesting. Its the CT's job to kick the crap outta the Terrorists before they plan their next attack that could put civilization to an end.\r\n\r\n                                                              ! --README--!\r\nHey this was sort of a quick map that I made small, compact, and optimised to get the most FPS possible (probably not the most, but close enough). I did put a decent amount of work into it although I can say that 99% of my maps are zombie maps so give me a break on my first normal map! If you would like to make your own version of it, fix it, make it custom to fit your server/clan, then I only have two rules:\r\n\r\n1). Tell me that you are going to. If we come to agree, I will gladly send you the map file for editing.\r\n\r\n2). Give me credit. Dont say you made it. By taking out the \"_aoc_\" in the name you are violating the terms. All I ask is you keep that in and do not say you created the map.\r\n\r\nOther than that, if you are just looking for a map to add to your server for a fun time and could give a rats *** about editing it, then download, add, and enjoy!"
