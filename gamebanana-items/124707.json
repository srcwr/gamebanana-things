There are are four stages (one for each mapper) with no tile triggers and <u>only</u>&nbsp;stage reset triggers. Use this to your advantage. Stand on a bunny-hop pad to enjoy the scenery, or take time to figure out what to do next.<br><br><u>Enabling your radar and \"color correction\" in settings is advised.</u><br><br>Also, do not hesitate to look for any Easter-eggs or secrets (they are abundant).<br><br>Thank you for playing.<br><br><br><br><br><span class=\"Spoiler\">Happy birthday Oliver, love you.</span><br><h3><br></h3>"
