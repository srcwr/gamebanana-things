	"_sText": "THE WAR OF FORTZ. DE_FORTWARZ&nbsp;<br>(Heavily inspired by 2Fort and Warlords from RED FACTION)<br><br>LISTEN UP BECAUSE IM NOT GOING TO SAY THIS TWICE.<br><br>BOMBSITE A IS THE RED SQUARE OF THE BRIDGE. (Sniper Hell)<br><br>BOMBSITE B IS THE RED SQUARE DIRECTLY BELOW UNDERGROUND. (Rifle/SMG/Shotgun Hell)<br><br>Now that that is out of the way. This map was made in over a month with pvp in mind. The map is mirrored on both sides. The difference? One is more blue, the other is more red. DUH.<br>&nbsp;<br>Also if you know me, you'll know I like using BS mechanics to change things up and because it's funny so of course I put explosive barrels in TNT crates. There are also spinning MEDKITS that will heal up to 100 health upon contact. If you get headshot by an AK47 you die instantly so MEDKITS are only useful if your enemy is bad at aiming, or isn't hacking lol.<br><br>That's basically it. There are two secret storage rooms, and an easter egg that is easy to find if you spectate. -Brent/Catfish Tamer<br><br>Big thanks to my friend, Sil for working on the NAV mesh!"
