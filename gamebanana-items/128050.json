	"_sText": "Course map originally named mg_gore_course_b1, created by ScHoOuFi and La Boule (original). I just took the map and fixed all of the leaks and optimized it a bit.\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of this 'fix' was to improve performance on low-end PCs. So, for those still using toasters to play CS:S (including myself), this is for you. (~30 FPS on high settings looking down the hallway from spawn in original; 90-100 FPS in optimized version)\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Optimization and leak fixes; previously, the entire map was rendered at once. Areaportals have been placed at every door\r\n- Ice skate ramp is now a simple brush rather than a displacement, should no longer stop you\r\n- Spawn timer changed from 10s to 30s; screen shake drastically reduced to avoid annoyance\r\n- Secret trails adjusted a bit\r\n- Added more player spawns.\r\n- The floating sofa in level 3 has a static orientation.\r\n- maybe some more I forgot about\r\n\r\nI do not take any credit for creating this map; all credit belongs to the other authors listed under \"Original Authors\" above."
