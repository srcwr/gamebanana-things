Now with lighting<br>{NOTE IF YOU DOWNLOADED BEFORE, REDOWNLOAD NOW FOR NEW VERSION} File is called v2 so you should know.<br><br>-- I know the shape is not a hexagon, i just couldn't think of a name so meh leave it alone --<br><br>Simple gun game map that I had made. took me a while to make because i've been having problems with pakrat for months now. Though now i will be releasing more maps, not tons but more in future. &nbsp;<br><br>Side note to add: the grey platforms that you see between the red and white platforms actually lift you up when you stand on them, making gameplay a bit more fun; using it as cover, mobility and sneak kills.&nbsp;<br><br>-- All textures By me EXCEPT grass and skybox.<br><br>[To download put the folder into the ...cstrike/css/maps folder"
