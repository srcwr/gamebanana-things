	"_sText": "<b>surf_grotto </b>is a Tier 3 Staged map with 6 Stages and 3 Bonuses.<br><br>This is a map that I made in around a week, and then took a couple more to get around to finishing. Thanks to Sam and Spy Complex for somehow convincing me to make a map at all, and then yelling at me to finish the map.<br><br>The map is inspired by old staged maps like surf_portal_game4, but ended up having a more modern feel. Everything is fairly easy, but there are tons of skips + optimizations all over the stages and bonuses to keep it interesting.<br><br>Bonus 1 is by me, Bonus 2 is by Spy Complex, and Bonus 3 is by pretzL. Thanks to both of them for making bonuses in a very quick time.<br><br>And thanks to xen for helping me solve an issue with the map + learn about something I didn't know in hammer.<br>"
