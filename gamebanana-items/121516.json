Ive completely remade the map but the only notable changes are custom textures, smoothing ramps, overall better aesthetics, and a new jail. The goal was to keep as much of the theory and layout of the map as original as i could while making it up to today standards; hopefully ive been successful.<br>Note: i am not the original creator of this map"
