	"_sText": "I like the map better without any lighting effects (ie. fullbright) because it makes the map seem more like a rainy day.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 forts on opposite sides of a breakable wall.  The wall floats over a big hole in the ground with a pool of water in the middle.  If you go into the water there are 2 ledges on the side with 3 teleports on each side.  In the air there is a floating ... sniper tower thingy which is pretty fun.  Other than that there is some well placed cover and a good layout for gg or fy servers."
