	"_sText": "Hello All.\r\nWelcome to fy_scoutzglass\r\n\r\nThis map was created solely by Trexxasaurus.\r\n\r\nThe basics of this map are to try and work together as a team to try and kill the opposing force that is on the opposite side of the map. You will need to have aim and skill but will need to learn how to work together. There are a few things that occur in the duration of this map.\r\n\r\nFirst, the AFK's will be destroyed 30 seconds after the round starts. This is so you will not have to deal with afk's on your map.\r\n\r\nSecond, the door to the bottom of the map will open after one minute if you haven't killed each other by this time. This makes it so you can hunt down the other team if they are hiding.\r\n\r\nThird, a secret shotgun will drop in the map after 2 minutes. This usually means that the round will never end and you need a boost of power to end it.\r\n\r\nThere are 8 spawn points for each team which means that this map can hold up to 16 players. You have access to scouts and grenades and one lucky person will find the shotgun.\r\n\r\n(Tested and played on a 66 tic server)\r\nWITH NO BLOCK!\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n\r\nMajor Pain - ideas/grammar editor\r\nBucketofPwnage - ideas\r\nCorn Ibulus - hammer help\r\nLoller Dan - hammer help"
