	"_sText": "Idea by: Ace of spades\r\nOriginally Made for the &#1202;treme&#8482; clan server.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map is made for 24 players.  It has buy zones in each spawn.  The map has some cover and towers for  snipers.  On top of spawn there is a sniper spot and a ladder connect the roof of your spawn to the main/middle tower.  Both smaller towers have 2 floors to them a middle and top.  The floors are boxed in to give you cover and so you don't fall off.  The main/middle tower has 3 floors to it, but is much larger then the smaller two towers it is about twice the size of them maybe a little less.  The first floor on the main/middle tower does not provide any cover, yet the the 2nd and 3rd/top floor do have cover on each side of floor.  The cover on the towers is enough to protect you but small enough to shoot over with.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy my map!\r\n\r\nThis map was created by A Drunken Retard \r\n\r\n"
