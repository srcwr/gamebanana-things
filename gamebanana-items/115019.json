	"_sText": "Wanted a desert setting for a deagle variant. The 'crates' are in the general shape and placement of the original but I made the entire middle area has been expanded, (along with the outer walk ways), and different structures have been added. While this is definitely not a re-texture of deagle I wanted the overall feel of the tight quarters. The entire top section of the perimeter is off limits to the player. In a couple of places, you can get up to that invisible barrier, but you can't cross it. \r\nAs with all my maps, if you happen to have feedback, please leave a comment. Also, I'm willing to make anyone custom versions of my maps with your logos or whatever inside, just let me know!\r\nHere's a link to a video of the map if you want a better look at it before downloading.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8yeT6H8YK0"
