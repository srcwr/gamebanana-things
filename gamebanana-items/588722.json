Well...</h2>That's because last time I updated cs_mansion_source to cs_mansion_2025, it didn't show up in the \"Updated\" tab of the Gamebanana page, so nobody really played it, that's a bummer, if that's how it's going to work, and considering this also has a different file name... Then, i'll be uploading a separate update.<br><br><h1>New to this update:</h1>-Improved bot / hostage nav considerably, it is not perfect, but they don't get stuck 24/7 like the 2023 version at least.<br>-Moved hostage rescue zone to be in the tunnel in order to make rescuing hostages less of a hassle, before, it was nearly impossible considering the default time is about 2 minutes.<br>-Cubemaps are now a thing, yeah, surprised it wasn't before.<br>-Made some small things more like the original.<br>-Slight optimization improvements.<br>-Improved 3D Skybox.<br><br>Also check out cs_mansion_2025:<br><a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/398586\">https://gamebanana.com/mods/398586</a><br><br>"
