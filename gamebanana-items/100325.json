The spetnaz is sent on place to contain threat.\r\n\r\nIt is a remake of cs_paranoia on 1.6, one of my map which is based on the mod paranoia for half life 1.\r\n\r\nA style hostage map with 4 hostages and 1 rescue zone, 32 slots and only indoor. a few time to rush at the hostages but several ways to go.\r\n\r\nThe preference for this map being ambience and visual, it's possible that the gameplay does not follow (but everything depends on the style of game of server).\r\n\r\n\r\n  *****Credits*****\r\n\r\n- Source Version by Valentin \"Dnj\"  Levillain (3Dnj@minerality.fr) \r\n\r\n- Original 1.6 version by 3Dnj   (visit my website : http://www.minerality.fr/ ) \r\n\r\n- Original idea from Paranoia team   (visit the Paranoia mod website : http://paranoia.level-design.ru/info_eng.htm#problems)\r\n\r\n-Ressouces: \r\n\r\n\tOriginal textures from me, \"Paranoia mod\" and \"Stalker Clear sky\", modified by me. \r\n\r\n\tAmbient custom sounds from \"Paranoia mod\", \"silent hill\" and \"Stalker clear sky\", modified by me. \r\n\r\n\tAmbient musics are from J.D. \r\n\r\n\tBig fan model and radio song are from Portal.\r\n\r\n-Special thanks : \r\n\r\n\tTo Moroes and Kane for they supports and helps. \r\n\r\n\tTo NykO18 for is \"Domokun's land of despair\" ans his test, Vans are coming to defeat you. :D \r\n\r\n\tTo Ph3nix for his help and his tests. \r\n\r\n\tTo the \"brakass team\" for the playtest. \r\n\r\n\tTo Comatrix and Kirumi for their help. \r\n\r\n\tTo Dartsmaul for his supports and test."
