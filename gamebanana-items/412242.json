Additionally, there is also AWPs in the tunnel network below, and can be found right through the hole in the middle of every spawn.<br><br>There is no buy zones, as this is intended to be strictly played with AWPs, however, if you wish to try out other weapons you are still able to give yourself some through the console.<br>- sv_cheats 1<br>- give weapon_[name]<br>"
