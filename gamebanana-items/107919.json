After watching some tuts i decided to try it, i finished it and uploaded it to my friends server (8.6.193.24:27015) and every one who joined it loved it. AWPers will love this map but also there is a underground passage to get to the other side so AWPers dont just kill every one, it gives other people a chance to sneak up on them and knife them or something. This map is very fun i dont believe you will be displeased.   \r\nPLEASE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK......THIS IS MY FIRST MAP!!!!!!!!"
