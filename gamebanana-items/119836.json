	"_sText": "This is the 5th jailbreak map I've made. I finally decided to post one of them on fps banana for the public. Spawns set up for 16 T 8 CT. I created everything in here all the custom stuff so please don't steal it, and if you just cant resist to steal it like the custom door at least contact me with a message asking for permission here. Includes cell room, hospital, cafeteria, weight cage, pool, soccer field, lots of skylights/rooftops to make game play interesting, and some other custom stuff I made that you can figure out. If you like this map please leave a comment and rate it, because if it is well received I will post my other 4 Jail Break maps I have made a while ago enjoy."
