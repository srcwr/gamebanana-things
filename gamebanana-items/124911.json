But here goes; I am a minion.<br><br>Every morning I meet up with my friends, and say \"bello\". The looks of despair I am greeted with mixed with the utmost disgust upsets me deeply. Just because I speak minionease.<br><br>I look in the mirror and shed a tear as I wish I was 4 feet smaller, and had only 1 eye. Kevin, Stuart and even Bob to an extent have always been role models of mine due to how well they act and the humour they exhibit.<br><br>Please don't be a hater and say that I am a troll punk, because even us minions have feelings too.<br><br>"
