	"_sText": "Very esthetically pleasing; this is one of those maps that truly has a theme to it. Though the map is made to resemble a historical mountain mansion or an abby of some sort (most likely the latter, hence the name), you do get the sense that it is inhabited. From the breathtaking central area to the waterfall to the little cross on the distant mountain, de_abbaye is truly beautiful. However, if I'm not mistaken, I do seem to be missing one texture (a painting or something on a few walls, noticeably in the indoor CT spawn area with the computers), and the waterfall sound could be a bit louder. Other than that, the map is relatively complex, with many hallways and exits, and definitely fun to explore. Awesome Job."
