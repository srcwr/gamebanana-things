As \r\neither a Counter-Terrorist or Terrorist operative, your objective is to \r\neither protect or destroy the strategically placed bomb sites.The map \r\noffers a balanced gameplay experience with a layout that encourages \r\ntactical decision-making and strategic planning. The facility is divided\r\n into two main sections: the exterior compound and the interior of the \r\nfacility. Each section presents its own challenges and opportunities for\r\n both teams.<br><br>The exterior compound features multiple entry \r\npoints, including a main gate, a side entrance, and a ventilation shaft.\r\n Counter-Terrorists can strategically position themselves to defend \r\nthese entry points, while Terrorists can plan their attack routes and \r\ncoordinate their movements.<br><br>Once inside the facility, the layout \r\nbecomes more intricate and complex. The interior is filled with various \r\nrooms, corridors, and staircases that provide cover and allow for \r\nclose-quarters combat. Both teams must utilize their skills and teamwork\r\n to gain an advantage in these tight spaces.<br><br>As a Terrorist, your\r\n goal is to plant and defend the bomb at one of the designated bomb \r\nsites. You must choose your targets wisely and coordinate with your team\r\n to successfully carry out the explosive mission.<br><br>Counter-Terrorists,\r\n on the other hand, must prevent the bomb from being planted or defuse \r\nit if it has already been planted. Communication, coordination, and map \r\ncontrol are essential for their success in neutralizing the threat.<br><br><span class=\"RedColor\">de_assault2013</span>\r\n features detailed textures, realistic lighting, and immersive \r\nsoundscapes that enhance the gameplay experience.
