	"_sText": "After creating aim_island, my first map, I got a private message from TempletonPeck asking to improve the map so he could place it on his gungame server. So I improved my map and here is the result:\r\n\r\n- Removed the weapons+tables at both spawns.\r\n- Removed 2 fishes and repositioned the remaining 2.\r\n- Removed the sign from the buoy.\r\n- Added a seagull on the buoy.\r\n- Added an extra ladder on both spawns.\r\n- Added more spawnpoints (each spawn has 16 now).\r\n- Added a bunch of tree's.\r\n- Added a lot of rocks for cover.\r\n- Added a sun.\r\n- Added a soundscape.\r\n- Added a 3d skybox representing endless water.\r\n- Extended the map border, I made it bigger, people can walk a bit in the surrounding water now.\r\n\r\nIn this map you'll spawn with a knife only, the gungame mod has to do the rest. I can make custom map versions with guns lying on the ground at request. Thats it, have fun!"
