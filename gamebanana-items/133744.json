I wanted it to be, so I made it easier accessible. Hover something I didn't take into account, was how fast the game play would go now that players are able to both advance and fight for the high ground.\r\n\r\nEven though AwpaholicA.com's servers hold picky regulars, this became a popular map, and is now played consistently.\r\n\r\nit has 32 spawns, and is a great map for quick games.\r\n\r\n\r\n--Thank you AwpaholicA.com--\r\n\r\nENJOY! AND PLEASE GIVE FEEDBACK!!!!"
