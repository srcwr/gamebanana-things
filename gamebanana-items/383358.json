	"_sText": "VERSION 2 OF DRUBUST IS NOW PUBLIC!<br><br>New York has never looked slightly more livable! Version 2 of drubust brings a collection of enhancements to the map and a whole new area doubling the playable space. Listed below are the specific new features:<br><br>The Subway! A brand new area for taking the hostages or your crew into. Explore the echo-y subway cars and stations with the overwhelming fear that someone's hiding in the corner.<br><br>The Crown Victoria! New York's staple car now litters the streets instead of the old CSS sedan. The model is ripped from Black Mesa, an amazing source game on steam. This car makes climbing vehicles that much more bearable on the map!<br><br>Rooftops! The 2 largest buildings now have actual rooftops, meaning if you stare at them, they aren't buggy like they are in V1. Along with this. The main buildings on T side have a little more decoration. And the building's windows have been adjusted to properly fit the window's covering the building!<br><br>V1 Will still be available for anyone who wishes to play it over V2. Find Drubust V1 at this link here to download it or read the story and setting of the map:<br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/356180<br><br><br>P.S. Van retexture NOT included."
