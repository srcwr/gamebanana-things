(Although its only a DE map in this version, it won't be anymore in future versions)\r\n\r\nThis map includes 3 vehicules for now, and 4 more are to be add later, one is really fast (the Bike), another is less speedy but has two places, one being a gunner position, and the last one (can be taken by choosing to pass through the vehicule door at the spawn), is a Giant Bipod, equipped with a laser and a rocket launcher being also able to jump.\r\n\r\nAt the Spawn you can choose through multiple super powers (Extra Life, Heal, Super Speed, Invisibility), there are two levels of each, but you can't choose the same twice, depending on whether you choose one, two (or none) you'll get more or less \"good\" weapons.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't be scared, this is a dynamic map, the layer will change randomly adding to the uniqueness of this map.\r\n\r\nThis is a video sample of what you may experience :\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/r0EDMCHj3dU?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/r0EDMCHj3dU?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAnd this one is for the only purpose of showing you the handling of the \"Bipod\"\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/58gs39Qlgw0?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/58gs39Qlgw0?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>"
