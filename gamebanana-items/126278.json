Quite a big map with bonus and LJ section. I made this with legit bhop in mind, but it should be fine for auto as well.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to George and Badges (as well as Keyuu). Without their assistance and patience, I don't think this map ever would have neared completion.\r\n\r\nI've learned lots while making this and hope you all enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it. \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nNtag"
