You can choose to take shelter in some of the buildings and try to hold off the zombies, or run for your life!. There are numerous traps, and dangerous obstacles to overcome. At the end there is a building fortified by the military, with a bomb shelter, where if necessary you can arm the nuke and destroy everyone, and everything in the city!"
