	"_sText": "Eons ago, a war raged between the wise Architects and the mystical Angels. Half-buried in this mountainrange, near one of God's vile towers, the severed head of a particularly vast Angel dominates the horizon...\r\n\r\nYahweh is a small, simple Gun Game map. Cooling towers and a wall running through the middle provide plenty of cover, and large openings in the walls give a nice view of the surrounding landscape."
