	"_sText": "I wanted to try my hand at making a map that took full advantage of HDR and a sun to boot. It features two cranes that are connected by two wooden planks. The top of the crane and the catwalk are the two chokepoints. You can also lure your foe into spawn and sneak up on them. So yeah, the skybox may not be the best, but come on, I managed to line up the cranes in the playfield with the continuation in the skybox. The construction took last night and a couple of added hours today to decide and add visuals. Sorry if the nav file wasn't included, but it should only take less than 10 second to create. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nEDIT 7/27/07:\r\nPlease redownload this, I have repackaged everything in a single BSP."
