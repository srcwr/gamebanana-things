	"_sText": "HELLO!\r\n\r\nI made this map couple months ago, tested it in my friends minigame server and I was suprised how much it got good feedback. So I decided to upload it here. \r\n\r\nAnyways, this map is rather short including 25 good looking and well made levels. There are also many awesome textures, some made by me and other downloaded from here,  credits can bee seen at the end of the map. I also made music that plays background. When you have finished the map there are still a lot to do, 2 bonus levels and secrets all around the map. So you wont be bored!:D\r\n\r\nI made this map to be \"easy\", so everyone should pass through this obstacle course.\r\nI hope you like it, give me feedback and don't forget to rate!:DD\r\n\r\nINCLUDES SUPER HIGH FPS!!!"
