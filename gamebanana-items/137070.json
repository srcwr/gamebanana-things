	"_sText": "Tilesz style is something I made up. It's simple, whenever you step onto a tile it glows. This kinda helps people find each other when a game gets to lower numbers of players.\r\nThanks to FPSB, I'd have no other way to submit my crappy maps if it weren't for you.\r\nThis version is the last for this map. I just added some more funky \"art\" of mine to the walls, and some actual cover. The inside of the buildings have 2 windows now and they have a bit better view to snipe from. Hope everyone enjoys my map. \r\n\r\nNAV file included!"
