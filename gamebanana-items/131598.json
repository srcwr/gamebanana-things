	"_sText": "Yes this needs to be a little optimized to improve FPS ratings. This was tested on GGODD's server with a full load of 20 people and it ran alright cause I have a decent computer that can handle it. But even with that I got about >20 If your looking towards all the buildings on a roof. A new version of this WILL be made to improve fps and make the roofs more decent. Aside from that there are a  lot of secrets that I like you all to expect from me. Each corner has a different theme (construction, finished building, combine, black & white) and every roof has its own secret to get onto, so yull be spending some time on that. Have fun and a new b3 will be out in the future, ENJOY!\r\n-Wildcard777\r\n\r\np.s. If yu'll notice, some of the screenshots are of older versions of the map. Just an FYI. I have touched it up since then ;)"
