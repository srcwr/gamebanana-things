The room where you plant the bomb has the hostages in it. The hostages are near the CT spawn, but the hostage rescue zone is all the way over by the T spawn which makes this map one that truely requires you to have a lot of skill to play good in.\r\n\r\nThe bombsite is labeled as 'A' on the radar and the hostage rescue zone is labeled 'H'. The bomb planting zone is the same as the area where they hostages are waiting to be rescued at so 'A' also indicates where the hostages start. \r\n\r\nIn this map the main area is inside the building, but you can get on top of the building by climbing a ladder near spawn. Or you can go under it, and like most buildings, has no light under it. So that requires you to buy either nightvision or use a flashlight. \r\n\r\nYou can also run around the outside of the building and use the vehicles and trees as cover to protect you. \r\n\r\nThis is an excellent sniping map and anyone who loves sniping should try it. But I wouldn't recommend it for close range weapons such as the dualies. \r\n\r\nI played in this map a few times already both with and without bots. This is the only map i've really taken the time to work out each and every little problem it has. I've been working at this map for almost a week now for about 4 hours every day (6 hours one of the days). I compiled it 7 times and made the .nav file 3 times before I got the entire map perfectly how I wanted it. \r\n\r\nThe map has a buy zone and can hold upto 40 players (20 per team).\r\n\r\nI've had an idea for a CS/DE map for a long time but never could think of a good one that would actually work right and fairly for both teams. This was the first successful map i've made like this. \r\n\r\nPlease try it out and assess it, I'll take anything anyone wants to say as long as it will help me make my map better. \r\n\r\nSorry about the lack of screenshots, it was hard to get good ones in this map. I hope the ones I have are enough to show what the map is like without actually playing in it.\r\n\r\nFind version 2 of this map here: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/42296"
