	"_sText": "This is the renewed and improved version of oldest map of mine, <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/61520\">de_varasto</a> here on FPSBANANA. This one is called de_varasto_v3 and it is propably the last and latest version of this map. This contains fixes and addresses some of the issues that were left in the first official release due to my lack of skills in mapping. While this map received some great ratings over a year ago, this one is even better than before! You are advised to upgrade to this latest version. In it, i have adressed some concerns that came after the map was released.\r\n\r\nThe most important changes in this are:\r\n\r\n- Fixes the crashbug that is occuring especially with large servers\r\n- FPS is up to 35% better depending on the area!\r\n- Added more optimizations, eyecandy and so on.\r\n- No layout changes, only minor fixes.\r\n\r\nFull map changelog can be found from <a href=\"http://ics-base.net/css_skins/if_varasto_changes.php\">here!</a>\r\n\r\nCreated by ICS 3rd of August 2008, Updated 31st of July 2009!\r\nE-mail: ics@ics-base.net\r\nWWW: http://www.ics-base.net\r\n\r\nCheck out more maps from my website, <a href=\"http://ics-base.net/css_maps\">http://ics-base.net/css_maps</a>\r\n\r\nThis map is also in mapcycle on the following servers:\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#00FF00\"><b>89.166.50.111:27025</b> - Pelipurkki.net #1 - 50+ Custom maps, tickrate 100</a></font>\r\n<font color=\"#00AAFF\"><b>89.166.50.111:27035</b> - Pelipurkki.net #2 - 50+ ICS + Hakk1tus maps only!</a></font>\r\n\r\nWhat is also cool is that i have released the map vmf officially so you can see how it's done. Note that you are NOT allowed to do remakes or make any changes to this map. The VMF can be downloaded at my website, <a href=\"http://www.ics-base.net/css_skins/if_maps_varasto.php\">here</a>\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
