The main purpose of this map is speed running, so it's short enough for no-fail runs. In the end there is only a little longjump section, for players who have finished or are too bored for another run and prevent rtv. \r\n\r\n**This is a _strafe map, it forces <code>sv\\_enablebunnyhopping 0</code>, limiting the amount of speed you can get from jumps. You cannot rely on good jumps to finish this map, so you must use proper strafing.**\r\n\r\nFor me many maps in Source are too long to do proper speed runs. I think this is a map length which is good for speed runs, where the really best strafing and no-fail run counts.\r\n\r\nUse 300 fps, 100 tick, no scouts, no cheats. \r\n\r\nI hope you have fun playing this and that this map will inspire many other mappers, to do more maps like this, which require proper strafing. Thanks to [badges](http://gamebanana.com/members/883044 \"badges' profile\") for the great idea of just using <code>sv\\_enablebunnyhopping 0</code>.\r\n\r\nHave fun, \r\n\r\nkeyuu"
