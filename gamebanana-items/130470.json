I wouldn't recommend more them 10 players on this map. But made it with 24 spawns anyways.\r\n\r\nIt is modelled after Mortal Kombat's Kuatan Palace arena. It is not a perfect copy though, I just tried to make it look like that.\r\n\r\nMap has no problems as it is but still has a lot of room for improvement :) Maybe a bigger version or something..\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMusic, \"fight\" voice, original map design and mortal kombat logo belongs to the [NetherRealm Studios](http://www.netherrealm.com/ \"nether realm\")' [Mortal Kombat](http://www.mortalkombat.com/ \"Mortal Kombat\") ([Kuatan Palace](http://mortalkombat.wikia.com/wiki/Kuatan_Palace \"Kuatan Palace\").)\r\n\r\n[Countdown voice](https://www.freesound.org/people/Corsica_S/sounds/82986/ \"Countdown Voice\") by [Corsica_S / Amy Gedgaudas](https://www.freesound.org/people/Corsica_S/ \"Corsica S\") is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ \"CC BY 3.0\")"
