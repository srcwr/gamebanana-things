	"_sText": "This is a fairly large gungame map that is supposed to recreate diddy kong racing's Icicle pyramid battle arena. The recreation is a little off because I was doing it from memory, but it's pretty close. I did add an N64 logo in the middle to make it impossible to shoot across the bottom of the arena, making the top levels more accessible.  It is fairly large for a gungame map. \r\n\r\nPlease provide feedback. If you upload it to your server or use it to make another map, I'd love to hear about it through a private message or by posting here."
