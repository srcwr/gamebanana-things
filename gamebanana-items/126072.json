You have been warned.<br><br>Now that is out of the way this is a little 40 second or so strafe map I spent the last week or two on.<br><br>Oh and the gameplay of this map isn't really similar to winter or summer land at all but I saw the opportunity and I took it.<br><br>There is one bonus that you can get to from the teleporter at the end of the map.&nbsp;"
