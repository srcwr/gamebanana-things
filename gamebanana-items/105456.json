	"_sText": "This is a textured version/modification to Mohax's aim_ag_texture2 map. The original design and layout is all by Mohax. My main goal with this map was to create a realistic looking version of this map, in a believable setting. I Changed several things, such as adding more CT cover, adding a bride from ct platform to the bunker, and made some adjustments to the ramp that goes up to the right of the ct base. I made these changes in response to how I felt about the original map, and what I would have done differently. The gameplay should only be better though! I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nSteam Friends Name: trancepx\r\nAIM= Tranceparadox\r\nemail = MrDoctorSir@gmail.com"
