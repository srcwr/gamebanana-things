Should be optimal for around 10 players. I used time with rounded corners and such for better look and detail. And now to the biggest point of the map.\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#ff5000\"><center><b><u>EVERY WOODEN PART IN THE MAP CAN BE DESTROYED!!</b></u></center></font>\r\n\r\nYeah that's right. Every part with wooden texture can be shot down. Just look at the screenshots, there's alot things you can destroy! That's why I named it destructible ;)\r\n\r\n<center>-----</center>\r\nI didn't have really time for good bug testing, so I'd highly apreciate if you could tell me if you're going to put this on your servers, because I'd like to take a look how it works with much players. Also, please post a comment if you find any bugs or exploits so I can fix them for beta 2 :)\r\n\r\n<center>-----\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#00ff00\"><b>Map includes:</b></center></font>\r\n\r\n-32 player spawns (16 each team)\r\n-3D Skybox\r\n-Lots of func_breakable entitys\r\n-Dark lighting with lots of shadows\r\n-Huge amount of decals\r\n-Nav -file\r\n-And epic sexiness by SwatMat ;)\r\n\r\n<center>-----</center>\r\n\r\nI hope you have as much fun as I did while making it. Remember to comment, asses and ofcourse test the map ingame so you see all the sexiness by yourself. :)\r\n\r\n<b>Have fun! I hope you have great time with this map! :)</b>"
