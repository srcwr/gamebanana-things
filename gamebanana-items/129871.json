There is a bare-bones Soccer field and a basic pool. Of course, there are secrets to help the Rebels achieve their malicious goals for killing the CTs. Some are obvious. I originally started this as a practice map, but it grew to be a Jailbreak map. \r\n\r\nIf You Have Any Concerns Add Me On Steam.\r\n[http://steamcommunity.com/id/konkarne/](http://steamcommunity.com/id/konkarne/ \"http://steamcommunity.com/id/konkarne/\")"
