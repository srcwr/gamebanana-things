	"_sText": "Here is some confidential information about fy_abysmal:\r\n<br>\r\n<br>DIFFICULT: Easy for anyone who knows how to buy/change weapons, otherwise it might be \"hard?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>STRATEGY: When playing in big gameservers your team is something that COUNTS. But mostly its all about fragging when playing in public gameservers, so you should be aware all the time if your team is going for rush or just playing defensive game. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Also Remember to watch out for the windows (more like holes in the wall) when you are sneaking behind nearest box or leaning against the wall. Because your opposite team most likely have [UK]Snipers among them. And they will be waiting for YOU to show up so they can (suprise sidney) kill you or (If they miss) tell your position to their friends. AND YEAH even that TERMINATOR69 and hes buddy fuck7ard_666_mp3 will have advantage if they know where you and your buddy's are hiding!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>GAMEPLAY: There is simple paths you can follow and it takes time to go from spawn point to another so i bet the map is somewhere between medium-large size. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>And next step! DOWNLOAD this map right away and give me your assessments."
