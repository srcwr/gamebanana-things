	"_sText": "This is a tier 4 staged surf map with 6 stages. Its a fairly active map with lots of big jumps. Each stage is challenging and satisfying to complete. Each stage is about 20 - 30 seconds long, so a full run should be about 2 and a half to 3 minutes for a no-fail. The visual style is minimalistic and was inspired by surf_polygon. The textures are custom made by me to achieve a flat shaded minimal look. The surf was also inspired by polygon along with other surfs like stonework. \r\n\r\nThere are timer triggers at the start of each stage and at the end; the name are: stage1_start, stage2_start, stage3_start, stage4_start, stage5_start, stage6_start, and mapend.\r\n\r\nHere is a video showcasing the map: \r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZxUK5z7hI-Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nI would like to extend a huge thank you to the ksf community and specifically: Juxtapo, Sacred, Krazy, mbsurfer, streebree, and everyone who helped me shape this map. I had a really fun time making and surfing this map, and I hope that everyone who surfs it also enjoys it. Thank you!\r\n\r\nGive the map a shot and tell me what you think."
