	"_sText": "This is a secret room prefab to be used in zombie mod maps. \r\n\r\nHow to get into the secret room ?\r\n1) pick weapon elites and throw them into the box (through the invisible wall)\r\n2) Press button marked on screenshot with red square\r\n3) get into the keypad \"room\" inside box (invisible wall) and type code 1987. However you can type code only when banana is flying on top part from left side to the right. You have just enough time to type code fast.\r\n\r\nWhats in the secret room ? (nothing special)\r\n- Locking system (if you press button you will force others to start from throwing deagle into the box to get into the secret box and so on instead of just typing code on the keypad)\r\n- healing pad\r\n- teleport back to spawn\r\n\r\nFell free to use this prefab in ur map as long as you credit me :) and ofc do not reupload prefab itself.\r\n\r\n* keypad code is made with random multiple numbers as well as keys have random numbers so its not that easy to check the code in hammer :)\r\n\r\n* vtf & bsp files included"
