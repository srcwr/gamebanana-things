This map changes that overused, repetitive style of game. Although this map is purely experimental, but it is guaranteed fun if played properly.\r\n\r\n![http://i.imgur.com/J3Mzgxl.png](http://i.imgur.com/J3Mzgxl.png \"\")\r\n\r\nThis minigame used the idea where T, only consist of 3 players are a superior team that gained a large advantages over CT,\r\nwhich could consist up to 48 players. While the objective of each minigames varies, Red has one main aim, to kill all CT.\r\nCT has to prevents that from happening by completing a specific type of objective with the help of their teammates.\r\n\r\nThere are NINE different minigames that can be chosen and THREE different music that perfectly enchance the ambience of the map.\r\nThe minigames are chosen by T and in each minigames, T will ALWAYS have different objective than CT and they both are required to\r\ndo different things.\r\n\r\nMinigame List:\r\n\r\n- Speed Run\r\n- Death Run\r\n- Tower Run\r\n- Deagle vs Knife\r\n- Shotgun vs Deagle\r\n- M4a1 vs Deagle\r\n- Hide and Seek\r\n- Fort\r\n- Grenade\r\n\r\nUnreleased Minigame:\r\n\r\n- Nemesis\r\n- Juggernaught\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral Tips:\r\n=============\r\n\r\n- Teamworking is compulsory for CT to win the game.\r\n- T must use some skills and experience depending on the minigame chosen to defeat CT.\r\n- T must use the upper advantages to successfully defeat CT.\r\n\r\n\r\n![http://i.imgur.com/Nw9rfDm.png](http://i.imgur.com/Nw9rfDm.png \"\")\r\n\r\n- 3 T spawn, 48 CT spawn.\r\n- Nine different fully functional multigames.
