God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby because it sure as hell heard you.\"</i><br><br>This map is a recreation of the Backrooms for CSS. It isn't really meant for playing matches in but it is good if you're going to use it for Garry's Mod. I tried to go the authentic yellow wallpaper look which I've not seen many people do when it comes to recreating the Backrooms in the Source engine. I hope you enjoy it.Â It's inspired by a YouTube video called \"INTO THE BACKROOMS\" by Evan Royalty<br><br><b>Made by StanleyLikesCyan</b>"
