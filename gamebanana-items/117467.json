	"_sText": "I made this map with no real goal or thought behind how it would actually turn out, I just wanted to make a large area with lots of hills as the main source of cover. The tops of the hills are textured with a grass texture to help indicate where they are and to make it easier to navigate through the map.\r\n\r\nI did include a .nav file (took 11 hours to make the nav file because of all the hills...) and tested the map with bots, and it really works very well and is actually kinda fun with the bots.\r\n\r\nI also included my barn prefabs that I made a while back to provide a little extra cover in the map to close up a few of the open areas. I also put in a few trees, a 3d skybox, some vehicles and 100 spawn points. \r\n\r\nand btw, I know I spelled desert wrong, I realized it after I compiled the map the final time and didn't wanna go back and fix it.\r\n\r\nand there are 3 invalid CT spawn points in the map, but with there being 100 spawn points, it shouldn't really matter too much."
