It is meant to be a similar port, that can be used for different gametypes like gungame, DM, or normal play (kill the other team)\r\n\r\nI also added a GunGame4 spawnpoint file for deathmatch servers. You would place es_fy_shipment_v2.sqldb in addons/eventscripts/gungame4/addons/gg_deathmatch/spawnpoints"
