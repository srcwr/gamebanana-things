The original map had a lot of aesthetic problems (bad brushwork, texturing, lighting) which I wanted to fix.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest and most complex maps I ever remade. It took about 3 years from start to finish, which included the creation of custom textures, sounds and models to use in the map.\r\n\r\nIt should be a lot easier to navigate compared to the old map. The carpet for every floor is color coded (blue is 1st floor, green is 2nd floor and red is third floor.) All main hallways use tile floors, and all stairwells use brick and concrete. There's also a radar map to aid in navigation."
