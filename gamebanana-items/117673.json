	"_sText": "This map is a small remake of my other map, dm_tunnels. This version of the map now has added routes and hallways to prevent bots and human players from crowding up one spot all the time. There are now multiple routes that can be taken instead of the regular head-on route.\r\n\r\nVersion 1:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/98745\r\n\r\nThis version has only one head-on route. If you would like to have only one route where the T's and CT's face off, then Version 1 is the map you want. The link is above."
