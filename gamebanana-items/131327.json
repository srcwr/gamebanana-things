	"_sText": "This started life as a wild west map but due to some fps problems I have changed it and created in a way where its a bit easyier for hammer editor to compile the portals so the optimization is better.\r\nMain thing for this project was working with breakables, so most of the windows and a lot of the doors break but I tried to add a little bit of realism in the way they break by adding some broken wood affects and so on.\r\nI spent a lot of the time making a clock tower, church and a kind of western town area which has a shop front affect and a saloon shaped building.\r\nTried to make it a little bit pretty, make as much as I could breakable but still keep it okay with the fps so that it doesnt lag which I think is very important.\r\n\r\n"
