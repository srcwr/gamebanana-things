I can't change anything more to the map ATM so anything modified will be in V2.\r\nThanks!\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nFIXED: AFK killer into a teleporter for respawning zombies.\r\n\r\nNew Music\r\n\r\nChanged map name to ze_lemonysnickets_v1 for Servers that had the map already\r\n\r\nMore Detail added\r\n\r\nChanged some timers and such\r\n\r\nFixed couple bugs"
