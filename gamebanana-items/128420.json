	"_sText": "What Do you Do?\r\nThe CT's start outside and must walk down the street (there is a slight push) as the T's shoot at them through the windows. The T's spawn in separate rooms in the building with a deagle and a windows to shoot from. Wen the CT's get inside, they receive guns to go kill the T's. Pretty simple, but most people seemed to love it.\r\n\r\nJust a small remake I did for my clan server. The old version was in dire need of new textures and all over renovation. I am kind of new to mapping, so give me some good input please?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPartyhard Porygon <3"
