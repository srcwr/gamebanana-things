	"_sText": "Back in 2016 I started 2 things, studying at a university and working on a map. You see I had just figured out how to deal with problems in Hammer, this essentially allowed me to make bigger, more complex maps. And I wanted to put my skills and efforts to the test... So i took an old idea I had for 1.6 and made these monsters of maps...Needless to say I learned alot, made several prefabs in the process and gained a massive headache in attempting to bend Hammer to my will...<br><br>The complete pack contains every single map from project-Wintermaze-2016 with VX being the crown jewel.&nbsp;<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b><u>About the map pack:&nbsp;</u></b></span><br><br>See the video for a guide of other maps. Alternate maps are seen on images.<br><br>Contains all the maps from project: Wintermaze_2016 (9 maps in total, originally planed 10, but couldn't figure out surf mapping).&nbsp;<br>If you're a simple individual that want's a somewhat simple map- <span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>V0,V1,V2,V3</b></span> and <b><u><span class=\"GreenColor\">Winterhill </span></u></b>might be for you. <span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>V4</b></span> and <b><span class=\"GreenColor\">V5</span></b> are huge and quite interactive with trains, helicopter and a working CCTV room as well as an armory.<br><br>If you want a bit of crayieness try the&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"GreenColor\"><u><b>VX&nbsp;</b></u></span>it has everything the previous maps has+ a working, explodable nuclear reactor and a working flood system that you can use to flood the tunnels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>All maps have a working minimap as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you'll like it and will have fun!&nbsp;<br><br><u><b><span class=\"GreenColor\">Final words:</span><br></b></u><br>This project took a long time to complete, It was a test for myself as a mapper in this process I did learn alot.&nbsp;<br><br>With this I will no longer make maps for Source. Might make some adjustments/corrections to old projects, maybe add some prefabs, but that's about it. I will move on to CS2 now.&nbsp;<br><br><u><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>Individual links for maps:</b></span></u><br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_VX</b></u><br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/490045<br><br><u><b>fy_Winterhill_2016</b></u><br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/477258<br><br><u><b>zm_Wintermaze_2016_beta</b></u><br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/421348<br><br><div class=\"SelectedElement\"><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_v0</b></u></div>https://gamebanana.com/mods/397618<br><br><b><u>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V5_beta</u></b><br>https://gamebanana.com/mods/394308<br><br><b><u>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V4_beta<br></u></b>https://gamebanana.com/mods/292411<br><br><b><u>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V3<br></u></b>https://gamebanana.com/mods/110997<br><br><b><u>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V2<br></u></b>https://gamebanana.com/mods/110996<br><br><u><b>aim_Wintermaze_2016_V1<br></b></u>https://gamebanana.com/mods/110995<br><br>"
