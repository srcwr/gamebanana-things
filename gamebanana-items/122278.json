	"_sText": "A surf map inspired by the ancient greek text, Ovid's Metamorphoses: Daedalus and Icarus.\r\n\r\nSurf through a four-leveled double helix, with enemy shotgun shells hot on your trail. If your wings fail you and you don't make it all the way, you spawn in a jail, referenced as \"hell\" by the beta testers, with a position and gun worthy of your ability. The tier of guns are as follows; knife, glock, deagle, m4a1, AWP.\r\n\r\nIncluded is a NON mat_fullbright map (pretty lighting) and some custom decals in the spawn (including the famous Icarus drawing from the album \"Led Zeppelin IV\"). Those who don't make it to the end can escape from jail through a set of doors, however, they don't open right away. It takes 80 seconds for the knife-area to be \"freed\", and each level above that becomes earlier in 20 second increments (play the map, you'll understand).\r\n\r\nEnjoy, if I get good feedback I may make other \"non-standard\" surf maps in the future.
