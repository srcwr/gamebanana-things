(biased I know)\r\n\r\nThis is my first map :D\r\n(so you can be as honest as you want - I won't be offended)\r\n\r\nIt DID look awsome with HDR - but I broke it along the way :`(\r\nnow each HDR compile has no lights at all?!  >.<\r\n\r\nPlease, please comment - either here, or email me.\r\n\r\nif I manage to fix the HDR (I doubt) I will release v2.\r\n\r\nOh and thanks a million to all the helpful people on here - the tutorials were awsome.  I had so much fun learning everything (still so much more to master)\r\n\r\nAnd if you run it in Europe please let me know so I can join :D\r\n\r\n*NOTE: the map has buyzones - is it still a fy_?  wasnt sure\r\n\r\nfull working BOT NAV mapping included\r\nEveything in one BSP file  :D"
