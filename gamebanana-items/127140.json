Well I believed that this map had a \"Excellent Gameplay\". You may not agree, but thats what I believe. It had Good GamePlay ( what I believe ) but bad texture, endings and no secrets.\r\n\r\nIf you played the original version of the map by Jogy, you may wonder \"What did this \"idiot\" do to the eleventh trap (The Hammers Of Doom)\", Hehehe I made I made it easier by making each hammer go at a different speed, the first one is at 250, then the second 300 and the last one 350. The default speed in the original map was 350, so thats how I made it easier.\r\n\r\nWhy did I add MiniStages? Well the name is deathrun_pro right? so it must be tested on skill, Counter Strike Source main skills. I added ministages that you would need to pass while playing in the game, each level has an exit, if you did not know the skill, although you had to sacrifice 30 HP to leave.\r\n\r\nWhat I did to this map is, retexture, redesign and re-edit the traps. I added a new trap only one ( It was a filler ) and secrets. There are 3 Secret Grenades with cool lazors and a secret ending, opened by the colour keypad.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank LionHeartnl/Whazaaaaa for making the BHOP Ending, Video, ideas and inspiration. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nNo more crashing.\r\nBrighter - due to the hole in the ceiling.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nLunarKirby The UnRealistic Mapper\r\nwww.SteamGamers.com\r\nDeathrun server - 64.34.212.187:27015"
