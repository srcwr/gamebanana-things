This is just to make \"knifing\" easier and getting shot unprepared, so you shit your pants :D \r\n\r\nIf you upload this to a server or you just want to try it up. Make sure you write in console \"buildcubemaps\" and restart again.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick name:\r\n~Khallal\r\nReal name:\r\n~Robin G.N\r\nLocation:\r\n~Sweden"
