Map is a bit small but the gameplay will be very fast and full of action. This beta version supports only 50 players but i will fix it up to 64 in final release. While i made this map i have couple usefull ideas to my next map. Hope you enjoy this beta. Have fun!\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any kind of bug have been found on it. I will try to release final version of this very soon.\r\n\r\nKnown bugs: plants looks weird but im working on it. Couple lights are missing. "
