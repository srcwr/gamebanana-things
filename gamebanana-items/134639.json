	"_sText": "This is a Gun Game Map in the Location  from a Dust Map. Its a small Map for a better Battle. You can play this Map with 32 Players. \r\nThe Spawn Areas are very clean, but the other Map Parts are many hide Spots. You can hide in 1 of the 4 Window Cabines or run trough the Side Ways. The Tower is walkable, you can climb on the Top and shot from a better Position. I hope you like it. Have Fun. And if someone put this Map on his Server, plz tell me this, i like to play my Map online with other Peoples."
