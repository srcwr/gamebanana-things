Info plates will disappear after 5 secs from start of round.  \r\n \r\nJail:\r\nIf you fall off into the void, you will be teleported to jail.  If the entire team ends up in the jail, they will be executed.  Prisoners can be released from jail via the standing in the appropriate \"Free\" Zone at the enemies' spawn.  People cannot shoot into/out of the jail.  \r\n\r\nOne on One Arena:\r\nPrisoners from opposing team can fight each other one on one by pressing the appropriate button whilst in jail (Only one person from each team can be in the One on One fight!)\r\n\r\nSpecial Zones with colours & symbols:\r\nRed with lightning bolt - Hurts the player\r\nBlue with arrow - Pushes the player in the direction of the arrow\r\nGreen with \"CT\" & Stars - Teleports CT's to a Yellow Pad (Does nothing to T's)\r\nYellow with \"T\" & Stars - Teleports T's to a Green Pad (Does nothing to CT's)\r\nOrange with plus signs - Heals the player\r\nPurple with question marks - Random Pad\r\n\r\nRandom Pad:\r\nThe Random Pad will give you one of several possible effects.  The random pad IS THE ONLY WAY to get guns.  The effects & their probabilities are:\r\nGive Glock & teleport to a random location - 1 in 4\r\nGive Dualies & teleport to jail - 1 in 6\r\nShake the level & teleport to a random location - 1 in 6\r\nDo nothing & teleport to a random location or jail - 1 in 8\r\nGive a Grenade & teleport to jail - 1 in 10\r\nGive Mac10 & teleport to jail - 1 in 10\r\nHeal 50hp & teleport to a random location - 1 in 10\r\nHurt 50hp & teleport to a random location - 1 in 10\r\nIgnite & teleport to a random location (usually lethal) - 1 in 10\r\nGive Awp & teleport to jail - 1 in 50 \r\n\r\nControllable Hazards:\r\nLasers - these can have their targets swapped via buttons in the jail\r\nRotators - these can reverse direction via buttons in the jail\r\nPush Beam Turrets - these can be controlled via a platform above the turret - hold down the appropriate button to move the beam in that direction - The beam will push any players it touches & knock them into jail - IF the beam hits a friendly or enemy while you are controlling it, you will be pushed off the turret contoller into jail (This was implemented due to the turret being too good, now the primary purpose of it is to put it in an advantageous location to hinder enemy movements rather than push them off)\r\n\r\nUncontrollable Hazards:\r\nMoving Pusher/Hurter - Will push you off the edge if it doesn't kill you first\r\nDisappearing/Reappearing Platforms - Transparent & will disappear & reappear entirelly at random.  \r\n\r\nRound Going too Long Hazard:\r\nThis hazard will appear at the bottom of the level & slowly move up, engulfing the level - It's big & red & will kill you instantly - This hazard is basically a kind of sudden death mode & drastically speeds up the movement of camping players - You can avoid it by teleporting from the top to the bottom while the hazard is in the middle of the level & still moving up (this is very hard to do in practice, also it DOES come back down)\r\n\r\n\r\nSize: 9.5MB (Includes a few custom textures:D)\r\nType: Knife & Jail (& sometimes small arms)\r\nSpawns: 14 each for T's and CT's\r\nAuthor: MaelstroMGooF\r\nFeedback: samgilligan@gmail.com\r\n"
