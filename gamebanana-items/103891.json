The place is high quality recreation center. On the other hand, unknown to the public, the place is also bleeding edge gene manipulation facility. You know gene manipulated soy beans are being developed for pig food at the warehouse next to the main building. You don't like gene manipulation.\r\n\r\nYour mission is to bomb the experimental soy beans to oblivion. Alternatively you can destroy the research archives at the second floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-TERRORISTS\r\n\r\nYou got track of the neo-environmentalists determined to their cause. The research work at the facility is not ideologically contradicting for you. You are sent to the place to prevent the research work being destroyed.\r\n\r\nYour mission is to prevent the terrorists from destroying the soy bean test bed and the archives.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated by: Ghost\r\nRelease Date: September 2007\r\nContact: http://css.setti.info/\r\nCapacity: 16 vs. 16 (32)"
