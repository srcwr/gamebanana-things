	"_sText": "Map Name: Slide Sewers\r\nCreator: (Tim) There are some who call me Tim\r\nFile Size: Roughly 35 Meg\r\nLevel Size: Medium - Long (slide standards)\r\nDifficulty: Medium\r\nCompile Setting: Fast Vis (horribly structured editor map, cant do normal properly)\r\n\r\nThis is my first and final release of this map. Despite the various glitches and errors it is a nicely detailed and entertaining map. It has a dark atmosphere so I would suggest anyone with medium to low brightness settings to increase it a tad.\r\n\r\nI apologies for not releasing a final or normal compiled map without any glitches. This is my first map, attempting to create a master piece while I was learning the ropes. I am very disappointed with how it came out but decided it will still be a nice contribution for those slide fans."
