Extract the \"poster\" folder to your cstrike\\materials directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: It's my first map for Counter strike and it took me about on 3 to 4 weeks to do it.\r\nIt mainly begun as an ideia to a Unreal Tournament Tactical Ops mod map, but i disgarded the project\r\nand only find it a couple months ago.\r\n\r\nIt's mainly assimetric aim_ map with 4 types of guns and 2 types of granades. Since i really get\r\nbored with mostly aim_ 'cause the normally are just square boxes with more boxes within, i tried\r\nto create a map with a little bit of visual eye candy...\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Janus and KillerSkull for their custom textures and brushes and all my friends who \r\ntested the map and gave me tips for it...\r\n\r\nHopefully i expect to realease more new maps with the next mounts, so keep a eye out ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow Bugs: The streetwalk looks a little to high and some env_cubemap issues (making some textures black from some angles)."
