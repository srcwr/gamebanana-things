	"_sText": "This is an updated version of the original cs_spetsnaz featured in the Official FilePlanet Source Mappack. Spawns have been increased to 32 and minor layout changes have been made to balance gameplay due to people camping around hostages by adding a window on the third floor, optimized it to run more efficiently, and fixed all the minor bugs. \r\n\r\nScenario: \r\n\r\nSet in Grozny, Russia. Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev has taken hostages and is holding them within a compound disguised as an ordinary warehouse. After days of failed negotiations, the Russian spetsnaz special operations team has been signaled to engage the compound. Engage the enemy by dropping thru the ceiling windows, side windows, vents, roof top sniper battles, and best of all, night vision... \r\n\r\nNOTE: There is a power switch on west exterior side of the building which can shut off the interior lighting. Use the lever on the power box and engage the enemy with nightvision. "
