The Counter-terrorists have gone to heaven and the Terrorists have gone to hell. \r\nIt was all so simple you thought....But the devil had other plans.\r\nThe devil has captured 4 hostages on route to heaven and plans on executing them down in his lair. God has sent the CTs down to investigate and hopefully rescue those hostages as they deserve to be in Heaven. It is the CTs job to escort them back to the gates of Heaven where they will be safe in God's hands. God has helped the CTs by giving them the clouds to walk on and the devil has hid the hostages among the many paths in the firey depths of hell.\r\n\r\nBut beware, don't fall from the heavens and don't burn in hell. You might take a turn for the worse."
