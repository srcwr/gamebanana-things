I will be releasing a new beta map of this in time, along with my first map scout_b2b. \r\n\r\nThis map has 32 Spawn points all together, 16 t, 16 ct. \r\n\r\nIt can be used as a GG map if wanted its very fast paced.\r\n\r\nI recommend 12 players, because I was testing it on my own dedicated server and it was comfortable not too laggy, but thats because I was also playing on the same machine.\r\n\r\nIts a basic but fun map, enjoy. CC is appreciated ^-^"
