Counter-Terrorists must prevent both targets being hit.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nHi all I'm new to mapping and this is just the second map I've created (may upload my 1st one later on).\r\n\r\nI am aware the long corridors surrounding site B may put a few off, however they are intend to provide an alternative but 'lengthy' routes going around Bombsite B. I am not sure if I should place boxes / decorations along these hallways though.\r\n\r\nFeedback and comments much appreciated. =)\r\n\r\n_Please beware the elevator may not function properly yet._ (OLD - see below)\r\n\r\nEDIT: _Also final version will be shipped with radar map and locations._ (OLD - see below)\r\n\r\nUPDATE / EDIT (2011-05-01): Map is now shipped with everything (materials, overviews, nav locations) packed into the .bsp by PackBSP."
