	"_sText": "This map was created by a friend named Jethamuel in less than two hours at a lan, it's a great little map and is very very fun even thought its small and basic. I then added lighting and effects such as fog, a sun, a better skybox, a soundscape (background sound) and a few other enhancements. If you run the map and your characters hands, gun and fingernails are white, type buildcubemaps (build cube maps) into your console. There will be a trippy compile screen then it will return to game, type exit into console then re open Counter Strike and run the map again. This is an issue involving HDR and cubemaps interfering with each other and is easily solved.\r\n-Have Fun"
