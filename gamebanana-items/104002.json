It's fully playable and usable at your servers while i struggle with existing issues in it that aren't actually visible unless you know mapping :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can play this map at <b> 89.166.50.111:27025</b> 38 players Pelipurkki.net #1 - 50+ Custom maps, tickrate 100, starting today.\r\n\r\nSee you there :-)\r\n\r\nCheck out my other maps from <a href=\"http://www.ics-base.net/css_maps\">http://www.ics-base.net/css_maps</a>"
