Just thought I'd let people know about it (original name of map is cs_crackhouse!v3).\r\n+ Terrorist spawn layout is a little bit different, has two ladders to get to the roof.\r\n+ Across the map there are a few ways to get on top of the other roofs, and there is no definite advantage to either team how there was in the original crackhouse design."
