	"_sText": "I made this map to prove a point. I visit css game servers everywhere and find crap maps like this. Personally, Running around 4 boxes is boring and this is what everyone seems to like now days. So here you go I made the best map in the world. I really would like to see how many downloads i get off this compared to the very few downloads Ive received from some of my best work. If you would like to download maps that will keep your css game server fun, full, exciting then get to my FPSB page and download the good stuff."
