Not ideal if you want to play with a lot of players but it can hold 32 players in total. Don't be afraid to explore every corner of the house: there is only one (quite obvious) deathtrap anyways.\r\n\r\nNOTE! I was told that this map could crash if played with more than +/- 20 people. This has only happened on one server and it's not confirmed, but you're warned.\r\nI would like to thank the guys at http://www.sovereign-forces.com for supporting the j2 mappers.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\nMiles \r\n\"Dr.Boo\"\r\n"
