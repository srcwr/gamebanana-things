	"_sText": "From cs_datablock\r\ndesigned in a DM style for use as a GG map.\r\n\r\n2nd beta release:\r\n32 players (recommend fewer, unless you like chaos and TKs :P), 1 level. Teams start on the same side but with the level ramps between them. This area is also filled with a block bullets brush to prevent spawn kills. On one level the gameplay should be very fast.\r\n\r\nRunning at full options my lowest FPS hit was 33 with an average of around 57*. My gfx is 6800 w/128mb and I run a 2.3ghz athlon w/1gb RAM. So this map should run fine for most everyone.\r\n\r\nPlease give lots of feedback! <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/wips/view/23014\">Vote Here Too!</a>\r\n\r\n.:NOTE:. It is a gg map, but does include buyzones.\r\n.:NOTE:. NAV File is standard CS:S generated.\r\n\r\nAdded some more lights, and I personally think it's light enough.\r\n\r\n* <small>This is alone in the server, no gun fire etc.</small>"
