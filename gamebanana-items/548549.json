	"_sText": "An abandoned mental hospital that hides terrible secrets. According to legend, people who got here never returned. The hospital itself is located in some kind of forest wilderness, where there is no connection with the outside world. The presence of blood on the floor suggests that this is not such an easy place. Beware of dangerous traps that can instantly take your life. Reveal the secrets of this hospital, and find out what happened here!<br><br>The map is created for zombie mode, but in the admin room you can find the story mode (Designed for one person) Do not run the story mode on a full server, all scripts can break. The story is short, and can be completed in 30-60 minutes. Also in the admin room there are buttons that activate events, such as turning off the lights on the entire map and activating traps. You can activate both at once. The map is divided into 4 main small zones, and seems quite cramped.<br><br>"
