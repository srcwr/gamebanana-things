	"_sText": "This is another one of my aim maps, I couldent help myself I made another one. Its very small, there is no restriction to a certian weapon, there are buyzones. A very confined area, but both teams cannot physicly reach eachother due to the big fall with water. The map is well detailed and no known gameplay bugs, however its untested so if you find bugs i'd love to know. \r\n\r\nIf you like my maps, visit www.gamerslife.dpclan.co.uk ,register and support. Show some love."
