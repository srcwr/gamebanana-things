From the extracted folder, move \"BaseAssault.bsp\" into your \"cstrike\\maps\" folder.\r\nDefault directory path is \"C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\YOUR_COUNTERSTRIKE_NAME\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\"\r\n\r\n3. If there is no \"maps\" folder, you can create it and then move \"BaseAssault.bsp\" into that. (skip this step if there is already a \"maps\" folder)\r\n\r\n4. You have successfully installed the BaseAssault map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Other Mods to run alongside this map*\r\n\r\n1. This map works best with cssdm (counter-strike source deathmatch). This map is capture and hold, it needs this mod\r\nto complete it. Otherwise taking over the base is pointless because you don't spawn again. It is still playable and enjoyable,\r\nthough it becomes campers vs rushers.\r\n\r\n2. In order to get cssdm to work, metamod source must also be installed.\r\n\r\n3. Source mod is also needed to run the cssdm.\r\n\r\n(All these mods can be downloaded here from this webpage:   \r\nhttp://www.bailopan.net/cssdm/?page=download  )\r\n\r\nHere is a short video: \r\nhttp://au.youtube.com/watch?v=l9xm6lJ_26k"
