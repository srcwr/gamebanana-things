I've added in some features that I'm not if sure they will be popular or not, but the only way to improve a map is to try new things.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS...\r\nrockerdudeman\r\n\r\n(A nice small download for you once again!)\r\n\r\nPLEASE GIVE ME SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT TO IMPROVE SO THAT I CAN MAKE ANOTHER VERSION.
