You don't need to press and to drop the weapons, just get close to the ammocrates and they will open immediately, when you leave their range they will close in a second.<br><br>NOTE: I edited the default HL2 ammocrates, but forgot to remove the cubemap tests from them, I will update and remove them soon, as well as the invisible grenade on top of the glass.<br><br>"
