	"_sText": "Cobble 3k by -FuzzyFish-:\r\n\r\nThe year is 2085, it has been almost a century since a long forgotten attack was launched by the terrorist organization known as the Special Terrorism Recon Infiltration Killing Echelon. Or rather STRIKE for short, attempted to attack a small town little known town in the year 2001.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the governments of the world had united in the cause and formed a team of counter-terrorists known very simply as Counter-STRIKE (Counter Special Terrorism Recon Infiltration Killing Echelon). This group of minimally trained individuals working loosely as a team, successfully defended this locale. Among many other specifically chosen high value targets, such as:\r\n\r\n- Poor run down slums in the desert\r\n- Box canyons\r\n- Enclosed industrial complexes\r\n- Docks located oddly in isolated waters\r\n- Four random ice spires in the artic tundra\r\n- Large fragile glass buildings\r\n- Zombie reservations\r\n\r\nAfter the DustÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢ settled, Counter-STRIKE emerged the winner. But not at a cost any less than millions of lives, and trillions of dollars. Leaving governments around the world not only pennyless, but also low on defense forces. STRIKE was never heard from again, and the remains of Counter-STRIKE were disbanded.\r\n\r\nIt was at this decisive moment that large coorperations moved in taking over every inch of towns, and cities that they could. And with great success, many people welcomed a change from years of bloody battles. And welcomed the endless onslaght of fast-food, coffee, and electronics. Time moved on, everything moved on, it was an endless movement. \r\n\r\nYet no matter how much one moves on. Somethings never change, it was at this time STRIKE with the aid of an acquired vehicle allowing time travel struck back. At a time when the world knew nothing but peace, chubby people, and laziness. They were ready for a change, and once again the people had a cause to rally behind, it was time once more for Counter-STRIKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINT: Rumor has it the time-travelling car STRIKE used can be found parked carelessly around town. Perhaps it could be used to fight back against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n- -FuzzyFish- - Map, Textures, Sound Editing, Testing, etc.\r\n- David Johnston - Creator of de_cbble, and other CS maps. For which this layout is based.\r\n- Crystal Castles - Edited sound loop for a secret.\r\n- Hide - Edited sound loop. A small if not underwhelming tribute to Hondo's mapping excellence/insanity.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Mapping, not a bad way to spend a military deployment in the desert. \r\n- Said car can be driven around with a friend. Shoot for the windows, enjoy."
