Feedback is appreciated<br><br>A very small and simple Gun Game arena with a hazard in the middle - Wet cement that falls through a small corridor every thirty or so seconds, crushing anyone beneath it while also blocking the sight line passing through it.<br><br>No custom textures included - all base game stuff. A .nav mesh is also included for bot support. Also, the previously described hazard requires a long-ish jump to reach, meaning bots cannot reach it (I couldn't figure out how to make bots jump across gaps. Feel free tell me how in the comments!)<br>"
