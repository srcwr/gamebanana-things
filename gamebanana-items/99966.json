	"_sText": "The year is 2040, The Human race has sent scientist to Mars to study the planet and collect its resources, however the scientists were not alone. They captured some of the local life and put them in test chambers to study them. Until one escaped and caused the whole facility to evacuate.\r\n\r\nThe year is now 2050, Terrorists are at the abandoned facility to steal the nuclear waste left over from the facilityâ€™s nuclear power plant. CT's must stop the terrorist and rescue the remaining workers/scientists.\r\n\r\n- 125 hours went into this map.\r\n- Custom overview\r\n- custom skybox\r\n- 22 MB unrared\r\n\r\nInspiration - I received my inspiration from the alien/Prometheus movies. I wasn't going for the shiny and new look, but dirty, used, and forgotten.\r\n\r\nAll custom content is packed right into the .bsp, so no addition files need to be put anywhere.\r\n\r\n- The nav mesh for the hostages is a bit buggy, so the hostages may get stuck in a spot once in awhile, but just give them a good push, press \"E\" again, and they should move again."
