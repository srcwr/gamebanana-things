There's a few good camping spots, a few good sniper spots, and a few areas where you don't know what's right around the corner. \r\n\r\nIt's meant for 30 players...anymore, and it'd probably be a little too crowded. The map itself isn't that big, and the more people you have the more crazy it'll get. But hey! Crazy can be good sometimes.\r\n\r\nEnjoy playing it! I know I enjoyed making it.\r\n\r\n---Crate"
