In the .bsp file are all data \r\nincluded, navigation file, text file, textures and \r\nlast but not least the map overview.\r\n\r\nI hope you will have fun on this nice reload.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.: The best playercount for this map is between 12 an 14. With about 6 or 7 players in each team you will be able to defend your building and attack your enemy ones very well. I am happy for every positiv critic but sadly I wont change anything anymore because there are already 3 other version of my map and I dont want release one more of it. I hope you understand this. This map is running on glasserver.de:27015 nearly every day, may you join us and have some fun? =)\r\n\r\ngreetz\r\nKopf sucht Kugel"
