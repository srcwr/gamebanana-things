Thankfully, this gave me time over this half of a year to sit down when I had the time and just work away on this map piece by piece, ensuring genuine detail and ideas instead of forced work. The brushwork in this map is some of my favorite and in my opinion some of my best work I've ever done. I paid an incredible amount of attention to detail and I'm really happy with the way it came out.\r\n\r\nThe Map is essentially a small 2-lane bridge spanning a river in the middle of a war-torn city. The city itself hasn't yet been totally destroyed as fighting still rages in the distance. The Bridge, frozen in time at the exact moment of the attack. Forces clash once more on the bridge, civilians out of the equation, as the opponents go head to head in a fast-paced urban duck and cover environment. There isn't too many spots to go other than forward. Use the cover of the cars and debris to your advantage. You cannon enter any structures, only look, and survive long enough, you may even get to see a scripted event or two in the distance. \r\n\r\n<b>Please report any bugs / problems with the map, as I will update the map download link regularly with an fixed version of the map. Be sure to check the change logs for your bugs</b>\r\n\r\n<div> <b><u><center>Statistics</u></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Solids:</b> 1778\r\n<b>Faces:</b> 10176\r\n<b>Point Entities:</b> 521\r\n<b>Solid Entities:</b> 359\r\n<b>Unique Textures:</b> 84\r\n<b>Texture Memory:</b> 53.70MB\r\n<b>Displacements:</b> 129\r\n<b>Direct Lights:</b> 12\r\n<b>Cubemaps:</b> 29\r\n\r\n<b>Work Time:</b> Took me over 6 months.
