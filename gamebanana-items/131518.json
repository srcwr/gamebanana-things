Now I've made sure that I have made everything that can have nodraw on it have it, to optimize the map as much as I can.\r\n\r\nThe map takes place in a city and has a good number to hiding spots for a 32 player server. Though the map has 64 player spawnpoints I doubt you would want to play with that many.\r\n\r\nPlease if you have nay bugs or problems in the map email me at anda02@gmail.com."
