The idea is repesentar what would be a real escape in a prison, on this map is not directs or no games is like zombie escape but version jail.The prisoners made an explosion in prison for breaking the outside, this makes the security system locks the doors and the police can not leave on time, while escaping prisoners have to organize to block the different paths trap is made and delaying the guards.At the end of the road waiting for a rescue helicopter but they have to cross to the island on a raft and for that we are living few more chances of winning are more prisoners. Finally if they uence, the coast is bombarded by helicopter and prisoners earn.<br>It is recommended to play with at least 15 players in the terrorist team, but is very easy for the cops win.<br>to move the stones to fire set the command \"phys_pushscale 400\" for the map.<br><br>Hope you like.
