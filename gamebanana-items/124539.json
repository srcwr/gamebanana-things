Main map is 2min+ on a nofail run and the bonus is around a minute, both are very speedrun friendly. There were a lot of extra maps that I wanted to feature but there was just no place for them.<br><br>Main map consists of stages from: Sugarspeed, Verbena, Mentality, Flashbacks, Enlightened, Tumi, Terry, Relinquished, Askowo, Haunt, Accelerate, Bubblegum, Interstellar and Exiled.<br><br>Bonus consists of stages from: Hades, Poseidon, Aphrodite and Zeus.<br><br>Thanks and have fun.Â  :)<br>"
