	"_sText": "<b>awp_dusty_v1</b>\r\nThis is my first CS:S release, and I wanted to start off simple.  I was trying to practice using cubemaps, HDR, shadows, and lighting.  The map itself is a simple awp map.  It was designed simple, to help people practice with the awp, while providing a detailed environment.  It's a 32 man map, features limited protection, and is a flat level to practice head shotting.  The map runs well on any computer.\r\n\r\n<u><i>Features</i></u>\r\n-HDR\r\n-env_sun\r\n-Detailed lighting\r\n-Realistic Environment\r\n-Shadow Control\r\n\r\n<u><i>Install</i></u>\r\n1) Download to your desktop\r\n2) Right click and extract to the following location\r\n\r\n<i>C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\accountnamer\\counter-strike source\\cstrike</i>\r\n\r\n3) Start CS:S and enjoy\r\n\r\nPlease leave some feedback!"
