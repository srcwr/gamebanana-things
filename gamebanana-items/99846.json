This is my first\r\nserious css map im used to just making gmod maps.\r\n\r\nThis map has one way glass in two rooms either side of the main room so you can try and out-manuvoure your enemy. \r\n\r\nNav file included, so if you wana play with bots you dont have to wait to create a nav.\r\n\r\nThis map was made for high numbers, 30-40 players, but lower numbers are still fun!\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading, Enjoy :D"
