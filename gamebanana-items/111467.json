	"_sText": "This map was originally named fy_medcastles, but i decided the \"castles\" didn't look like castles at all because i suck at making realistic shapes. \r\n\r\nThe dark fort is the T fort, and the light fort is the CT fort. There are two sniper towers in each fort, plus the wall. There are two ladders on the backs of the forts wich can be used for backstabs, because there are two sideways hidden by rocks where you can sneak into the enemy fort without anyone noticing you. \r\n\r\nThere is also an underwater tunnel connecting the two forts, \r\nwich goes trough the river.\r\n\r\nI didn't include a NAV file, because it's a pain playing with bots. Why? The T bots pile up on the underwater passage entrance, and the CT bots get stuck in the river."
