I took these comments and retried my initial intent but this time with success.  I am now happy to say this new version of gg_divine is up for download.\r\n\r\nAs always I appreciate all feedback I get on my maps.\r\n\r\n \r\nMore screenshots are available at http://2021productions.com/?page_id=192\r\n\r\nFill free to check out my portfolio at http://2021productions.com/?page_id=138"
