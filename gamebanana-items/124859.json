It's very fast paced and has a lot of twists and turns, but it's also the shortest map I have/will ever publish, I don't particularly like short maps myself but I know a lot of bhoppers enjoy running them, so have fun. For those wondering, map is about 20 seconds long for someone decent. I also added in a pretty fun bhop bonus that I don't think I've used in a bhop map before. PS some of screenshots are different because it was a different version, the map you see in the video is what the map looks like currently.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/erai2uRqL8g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
