Shed any thoughts of bad quality due to designs based around the tag and not gameplay - this map has been carefully made to keep gameplay interesting and, at the same time, display [LL] to the gods. It's a small map good for anything from 2 to 10 players.\r\n\r\nFor those curious as to the whereabouts of version 1, it was never released (but was tested on our server publicly). This was due to a water texture error.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease visit the clan website www.llamalords.co.uk\r\nWe are not recruiting at the moment, however social and regular server players are usually welcome to join!\r\nThis map can be uploaded to other download portals if needs be.\r\nAsk my permission before editing or decompiling the map.\r\nSteam Friends: explosivose\r\n\r\nLL ftw ^_^"
