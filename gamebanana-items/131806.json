	"_sText": "Though it might seem similar in concept to ggodds map. The date it was created and the style are completely different. Actually, I created this map before his came out. ( http://auraclan.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=150 ) There are four teleports back up (fires) to prevent zombies getting stuck and adding some randomness to it. Humans can camp the blocks, or the thin strips of ground at the top. SHould be interesting ina full server. Email and bugs/problems to Something1@earthlink.net. It also includes on of the largests falls possible in CS:S. Quite funny watching people and zombies falling down into the water below. Enjoy!"
