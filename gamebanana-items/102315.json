(sorry, I really love nightfights)\r\n\r\n<i>Please do not share or edit this map without my permission\r\nAsk via my FSPB account if you would like to make any changes or share this map\r\nIf I give permission for you to do so, then please would you put my name in the credits, after all, it is my map\r\n</i>Thanks :)\r\n\r\nOh and one more thing... If any servers are running this map, could you let me know? I'd love to play it online against real people :)"
