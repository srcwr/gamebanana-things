After a quick tidy up of it, I decided to \r\nrelease the map fully.  Enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis is not up to my usual standard, as I said, I found it\r\non my HDD when cleaning up.  It plays a lto faster than\r\na normal breakfloor map as the blocks break easier, but\r\nthere are more of them.  Seeing as the compile log stated\r\nI had over %106 physics."
