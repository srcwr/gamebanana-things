Counter-Terrorists must prevent both targets from being hit.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nHi all I'm new to mapping and this is just the second map I've created (may upload my 1st one later on).\r\n\r\nI am aware the long corridors surrounding site B may put a few off, however they are intend to provide an alternative but 'lengthy' routes going around the bombsite.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between this and the beta's the lighting, and some alterations / extended parts.\r\n\r\nFeedback and comments much appreciated. =)"
