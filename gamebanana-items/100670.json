Unfortunately they were being watched and monitored by a ruthless syndicate that has made a fortune on other scientists discoveries in the world.  They have started to overtake the encampement in the early morning and now have the scientists under heavy guard in their wooden huts.\r\n\r\nThe Counter Terrorist force has been right behind the syndicate.  They are looking to set an example.  They have armed themselves heavily and have some of the best tactical strategists with them.\r\n\r\nSome Shiroko models used\r\nAll materials may be used by third parties.\r\n--------------\r\nIf you want to play this beauty by Vulcan with bots try the nav-pack by baldursnet ;-)."
