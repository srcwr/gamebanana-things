	"_sText": "A very thin map i made for a LAN party at my friend's house, a great map to play if you just want to spend a bit of time practicing your aim with a deagle or glock/usp. theres a scout rifle in the middle on top of the tow truck, the terrorists have a small advantage when it comes to running to the truck because Counter terrorists start with the usp and its pretty much a sure shot. it just makes the game a little more fair.\r\n\r\nplz dont rate based on looks, i know it looks like a movie set but remember that i made this in 10 minutes, thanks xD"
