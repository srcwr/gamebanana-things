	"_sText": "Have you ever looked on the serverlist in Counter-Strike? It's awesome, 1/4 of all server playing a Fun map, count all these surf, minigames and \"Sports\" Gametypes.\r\n\r\nEvery Map provide lots of Fun, but something is missing ...for that reason I decided to make a map, which combine lot of features mixed up with some innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nLet's call it: Relax.bsp.\r\n\r\nA Map which is completly unusefull, therefore perfectly after hours of Deathmatching and Bomb planting. Switch this on and you join a ...place.\r\n\r\nYou can play it alone, put it on a Server or in a Map rotation beetween some Deathmatch maps. The only thing you should enabled is instant respawn. Thats it.\r\n\r\nAt least, check out the screenshots and form your opinion. Explore RP, Fun and Secrets.\r\n\r\n"
