Along the way, there are spots for camping, but the map is really good for hunting style of gameplay. You choose what you want to do.<br><br>The map is heavily inspired by 4way_tunnels. I never wanted to make an exact copy. So... this is what I came up with. I hope you enjoy. Feel free to leave feedback in the comments. If issues arise, I might be compelled to fix them. It took 3+ months to complete the map.<br><br>If you are going to upload the map to a server, please include the .cfg file. It's important!"
