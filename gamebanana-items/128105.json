	"_sText": "NEW VERSION NOW AVAILABLE WITH NUMEROUS FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS: http://gamebanana.com/css/maps/166721\r\n\r\nIncludes 33 different obstacles/puzzles and 4 songs in total.\r\n\r\nThe map is divided in to sections, if you fall behind you die. It takes about 7:00 to complete from start to finish, but most rounds will probably take 2:30-4:00 minutes. Some of the obstacles have tricks to completing them without taking damage, and two are randomised for each round. The obstacles more or less get harder as the map goes on.\r\n\r\nThe spawn closes after 1:30 at the same time as the first 10 obstacles/puzzles\r\n\r\nSong credits are in the map, on the left side of the spawn room\r\n\r\nPlease rate and leave comments AFTER downloading and playing\r\n\r\n(DO NOT DECOMPILE, if you want to know how I made something, post a comment and I will answer eventually :))"
