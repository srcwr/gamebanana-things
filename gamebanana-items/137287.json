	"_sText": "This map is derived from aim_map_usp and features elements of both aim_map_usp and gg_deagle5_4hm. The map is played during the sunrise while it is snowing across the map. There are ramps at each spawn, and boxes scattered around the center of the map to make it feel like your playing both usp and deagle at the same time. There is a basement with some explosive barrels to help keep people from camping down there, as well as a light so you can see. There is also a secret room in the map, there is only one teleporter to get in to it though. There are only images in the secret room, so it's pretty much pointless and doesn't really effect the gameplay at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if anybody decides to go about and edit the map to their liking or whatever to credit me as an author.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CmG=|S| Knight (Kn1ght)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, for some reason, FPSBanana keeps checking background music as an effect, and knives on the ground even after unchecking them, so note that even though it says that, there is no background music or knives on the ground in this map."
