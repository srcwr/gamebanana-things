You have the choice to either bomb their interrogation room on the second floor of the \"Glass Manufacturing\" building, or bomb the CT's warehouse full of money they stole from the innocent people in the surrounding area. An updated version of this map is done and just needs to be tested to make sure everything is working fine. (bots dont get stuck, jump up and down, etc.) But bombsite A has been moved and many more obstacles have been added."
