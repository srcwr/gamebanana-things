	"_sText": "This is a map I did for Deutshmaschine a few years back. They have never released it as far as I know. I tried to contact them over the summer and their emails and servers were all gone. Someone named Loic contacted me awhile back asking why had I not released it, as they were playing it on their server. So I guess the map is in the wild now. Geometry is correct and optimized to the best of my abilities, doesn't say much as this was a tough map to optimize for Source, for me. I have a more heavily detailed version, but it plays for cr*p. If someone wants to try their hand at optimizing it let me know I'll send you the .vmf."
