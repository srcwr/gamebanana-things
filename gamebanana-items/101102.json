Little is left from the once holy place.\r\n\r\nThe year is 2047 and terrorists are going to attack again. Will you join them or will you fight them?!\r\n\r\nThe Terrorists need to open the gate to the underground military facility. In order to do that they need to bomb either the powerhouse that fuels the gate with electricity or directly bomb the heavy metal gate.\r\n\r\nThe Counter Terrorists need to prevent the bombing and eradicate all terrorist members.\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun soldier!"
