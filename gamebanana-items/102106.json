It is best suited to 5v5 matches, but I have \r\nadded spawn points for upto 30 players.\r\n\r\nBUGS: None?\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: Oh not another dust map I hear you say! well the truth is there are very few good ones and the texture set is both resource cheap and \r\nwell suited to spotting players from a long way off. The map is free to use, and circulate but please give me credit:) Also the name mtg is of my\r\n clan -> mtgeurope.com for more info.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to my wife for her patience and understanding:) \r\n\r\nemail me with any feedback/bugs please:)\r\n"
