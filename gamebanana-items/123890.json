	"_sText": "Beta release of my Rats map de Nicks Apartment \r\n\r\nThis map is an exact replica of my basement apartment. Its dimensions and size ratios are exactly proportionate. Some of the features included in my map are: a microwave that cooks you, a toaster oven that toasts you, a garbage can that trashes you, breakable boxes behind walls, illusionary walls, get weapon traps, getting squished by an array of things, and much more. This map is big, itâ€™s about 25 Megs, so downloading it from here will be much faster than from my server. Enjoy my map and have fun.\r\n"
