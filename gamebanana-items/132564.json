	"_sText": "EDIT:  As of December 13, I have uploaded a newer version with some minor fixes to the map.  I appologize to those of you who downloaded the older version, but because this was for a contest, I was forced to submit a map by the deadline.   Sorry again for this.  \r\n\r\nAnd thank you to all of you who have left positive feedback so far!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a map I built for the Interlopers ZM Mapping Contest.  It is somewhat similar to zm_lila_panic, by Lila, so I have named it zm_panic for now.  It contains an open outdoor area, with a single chokepoint leading to an underground subway.  \r\n\r\nThis map was made in about two weeks, so its not as polished as I would have hoped, but it still turned out good I think.  The map plays best with a large number of people (24-32).  Enjoy!"
