I don't know what happened there with my screenshot taking but it looks ALOT more detailed ingame.\r\n\r\nAt the end there is a shotgun and a deagle but be careful when rushing towards it hehe.\r\nNot as hard as sliderace_city, but pretty fun in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTeleport at the end of map going back to T or CT spawn to do map over again or go hunt people with your shotty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplease tell me what you think, i need to know what i need to improve on, and if I should make a better version of this map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't fall in the dich and watch out for traps!"
