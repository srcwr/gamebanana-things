I am currently unaware of the Zombie vs Human balance during the complete run, and it may require tweeking as there may well be some few bugs and glitch in the level.\r\n\r\nThis is my first map and i have worked hard on it. I would greatly appreciate people trying it out to see if they can find area that need fixing or improvement, and if you can make em yourself, go ahead!!!  IT will win you a spot in the author list.\r\n\r\nNote: this map is now going under a MAJOR OVERHAUL as Link102 and I are Polishing every aspect of this make to make it more: Performent, Fun, Playable, bug free and appealing.\r\n\r\nV2 of this map on the way soon and set to look like an actual map.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n"
