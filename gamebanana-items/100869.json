	"_sText": "This is a remake of the classic goldeneye/perfect dark map.  I added a few new parts to make the map more counter-strike friendly.  Let me know if these were good or bad ideas, and I will make changes as needed.  This was a fun map to make, got me plenty frustrated along the way though.  I remember playing this map all the time back on n64, I thought it would be fun to try to make it all from memory, I think in general I did a pretty good job with it...it's not 100% technically correct, but I hope you enjoy it anyways.  The map holds up to 40 players.  (note map is a bit brighter than these screen shots show)."
