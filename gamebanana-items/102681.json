The job of the counter-terrorists is to fan out across the sectioned off part of the city and destroy all terrorists while preventing a terrorist bombing. The job of the terrorists is to destroy all counter terrorists and bomb the counter terror organization establishment or the sky scraper look-out point. \r\n\r\nCounter-terrorists! STOP THE RIOTS!\r\n\r\nTerrorists! Bring the rioting to a new level of destruction and chaos!\r\n\r\nAuthors note:\r\n\r\nREMEMBER! This map plays better as a LOW GRAVITY MAP! \r\nEnter sv_gravity 200 into console.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map - despite my bias - is probably one of the most fun / well built that I've played. I did my best to include all the best features of the Source engine. If you're into city combat, you'll love de_illmatic. \r\n"
