After 4 betas I've finally released something I'm happy with.\r\n\r\n<blink><font color= red>Note:</blink> </font> This is my first attempt at using HRD. It's not very noticeable, read below for more info\r\n<hr>\r\nChange log is as follows....\r\n\r\nQuick Notes. Thanks to everyone for testing my maps and encouraging me. Pitch now has HDR, it's my first time working with HDR so I made it less intense compared to other maps. Also the pictures in Church glow bright white, sorry.\r\n\r\nzm_pitch (final version Max players <font color= red>64</font>)\r\n\t\r\n\t-Optimized- runs faster\r\n\t-Max players increased from 40 to 64\r\n\t-Added HDR\r\n\t-Lessened custom textures, should be smaller to download now\r\n\t-Church chairs don't \"push\" players away\r\n\t-Altered Church rafters\r\n\t-Blocked area under boxes, house across from Church\r\n\t-Most barricad-able and hiding areas have been improved"
