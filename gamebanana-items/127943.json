	"_sText": "This is my first minigame map. It's about ducks and hunters. The terrorists are ducks who have only knife but they can fly; while the Ct's are hunters with shotguns. Everybody recovers hp slowly, and there are lots of places to hide, some 'secrets' (well, that's not exactly the word).\r\n\r\nThe duck 'model' is just a phybox placed over the terrorists, covering their head. I know it's a bit ridiculous, but the map itself was made to be a bit absurd.\r\n\r\nThe action takes place near the hunters' house, surrounded by trees and containers.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to use flashlight.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Dog for his house prefab (here: http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/254).\r\n\r\nPS: CTs must destroy the door to leave the house."
