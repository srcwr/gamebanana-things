	"_sText": "This map is meant for snipers and holds upto 40 people. This is a rather large map and although it was made for snipers, those who like to use smaller weapons such as the AK47 and M4 can also have fun here if they can reach the water.\r\n\r\nThere is a tree line on both the T and CT sides on the tops of the hills of which the river runs between. These are more fore looks than cover.\r\n\r\nThere is also a sniper tower on both the T and CT side. The T side has a red light in it while the CT side has a blue one. The picture of the blue (CT) room looks very dark, although it's actually not as bad as it looks once you're in it. Both towers have windos that go all the way around 2 sides of the towers. You can also access the top of the towers by simply going up farther on the ladder that leads up to the tower. Going to the top you will have boxes for cover and you will have a very good over view of the area. \r\n\r\nThe river itself is fairly deep. You can easilly jump into the water from the hills that surround it and from there you can make a stealthy entry into the opposite team's spawn. "
