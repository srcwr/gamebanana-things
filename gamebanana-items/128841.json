Weapons can be found around the map with the more powerfull weapons in harder to reach places (good luck getting the autosniper).\r\n\r\nI hope this map has some playability as I love flying around with a M3 blasting players on top of the tower in the head, so hope players actually enjoy the level.\r\n\r\nOne secret on this level which is a player trail, you can find this by surfing under one of the four towers around the outside. On one corner there is a blue and white texture on a corner of the top floor. Hit the underside of it to get teleported.</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<CENTER><h1><font color=\"DarkOrange\">Change Log</font></h1></CENTER>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"DarkOrange\">v1</font>\r\n<font color=\"RoyalBlue\">First version of map released.</font>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"DarkOrange\">v2</font>\r\n<font color=\"RoyalBlue\">Added in a bomb site that becomes active 30 seconds into the round.\r\n\r\nSimplified some brush work on some of the outsides of the map.\r\n\r\nAdded in some physics boxes in the main tower room (bomb site).\r\n\r\nAdded water under the elevators as a fail safe in case the elevators ever bug and players fall through.</font>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"DarkOrange\">v3</font>\r\n<font color=\"RoyalBlue\">Bomb site is now working, had to remove the 30 second cooldown time though.</font>"
