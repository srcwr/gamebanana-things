	"_sText": "Gungame map, also works as a fight yard map. Comes with BSP, NAV and Read-me.\r\n\r\n- Buyzones included;\r\n- No weapons anywhere in the map;\r\n- Optional .NAV file.\r\n\r\nThis is the variant of gg\\_realmaze\\_a1. This map does not have the breakable boxes that gg\\_realmaze\\_a1 has, so it's a better map if your looking for a rounds game instead of gungame deathmatch. The map is a warehouse full of boxes that create an amazing tight and unpredictable labyrinth, making you feel like your lost but making you find your enemy at every corner! Be careful not to be humiliated while running!\r\n\r\nWell, this is the first playable version of the map, I intend to add outside lightning trough windows, I plan on making the lamps to be breakable and I plan to give the map some optimization, even though it runs pretty well without it (I get 300 FPS with 9 bots in the game so...).\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the map! Don't forget to comment and rate :)"
