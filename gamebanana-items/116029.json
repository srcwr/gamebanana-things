	"_sText": "This is a new Maptype inspired by the Dirtbike (aka Kickstart) Challenge from GTA: San Andreas\r\nYou have to collect as many points for your team as fast as possible.\r\nThe team who first collects 400 Points wins the round and the other Team gets killed. An explanationof the colours:\r\nGreen: 10 Points\r\nYellow: 20 Points\r\nRed: 30 Points\r\n\r\nThis map differs from gta_stadium because it has no secretroom, other lighting, and there are pushes for every ramp and before the loopings. Whatch out, cuz u might get killed when you try to do the loops. But  there are the most points on the loops.\r\n\r\nAny Bugs/Suggestions? Post comment!\r\n\r\nBest thanks to:\r\nEl Supremo\r\ndarth_brush\r\nDer_WiXXer\r\nJodokus\r\nSheepfreak\r\nChuck\r\nWindowsLive!\r\n\r\nI know people are making maps for this new gametyp and I have a good feeling about it cuz its something different :D"
