	"_sText": " FY_ROTATION_FINAL\r\n================\r\n    Created by: Ech0\r\n================\r\nThis map is another dust-based, fy map with a twist. There's a tower located in the middle of the map that has four spinning brushes, each going at a different speed. There's a battlefield below, but by climbing the tower and avoiding the spinning brushes, you can get to the top where you'll find a portal to another battlefield, larger yet more simplier than the previous one. Here you can find all kinds of goodies, like AWPs, grenades, and more.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that on this map you also buy whatever weapon you wish instead of having weapons available to you on the ground. It's against FY regulations, but this was to reduce any lag possible while playing. All in all, this allows players to have choices and creates a good gaming enviornment.\r\n================\r\n  SPECIAL THANKS:\r\n----------------------\r\n  http://www.ke0.info/\r\n  Ke0's Gaming Arena\r\n================\r\nThanks for downloading everyone!\r\nI welcome your comments now.\r\n\r\n-Elite| Ech0\r\n(http://clan-elite.editboard.com/index.forum)\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE NOTES:\r\n-------------------\r\n- Up to 250FPS for SRCDS Servers (with no one on them, mind you).\r\n- Works as a Zombie map as well as an fy map.\r\n- Recommended = 32 Players. Can hold up to 60, however.\r\n- This is the absolute final version of the map.\r\n- This map has been fully optimized to fix previous issues with lag and poor FPS."
