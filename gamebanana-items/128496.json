	"_sText": "MG_PUSH_WINDTUNNELZ\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nThis is a random Mini Game map, the aim of the map is to kill the opposite team player, while you are in an windtunnel bouncing up and down. In the whole windtunnel you can buy weapons. When you die ur body just drops into the huge fan that produces all the wind to push you up. There is no secret or possibility to shut the fan down.\r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nThe map uses standard textures and is very simple but nicly constructed for the eye. The program used was Source SDK. It is a push map, none other.\r\n\r\nWeapons:\r\n\r\nYou can use all weapons in this map because of the buyzone as said before. So you won't really get bored\r\n\r\nTime:\r\n\r\nIt took me about 2 hours to finish this map, because i really didnt know the exact push speed for the map thats why I had to try it out tons of times. But I am happy that the map is finally done.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\n\r\nPlease use constructive feedback so I can improve my map to make you happy, that you play my map.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nC:/Program/Steam/steamapps/counter-strike:source/cstruike/maps\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy playing this map,\r\n\r\n[SG] CRATE.exe\r\n\r\n"
