Many people feel this is the better map due to FPS issues and layout.  So instead of getting rid of de_hydrofire_b1, I decided to make it a final.\r\n\r\nAs compared to de_hydroco, the differences are listed below:\r\n\r\n-The sky and environment are a more interesting orange hue.\r\n-Added a overhead view as opposed to the betas not having one.\r\n-Alot more simple on the details along with MUCH BETTER frame rates.\r\n-A NAV file included (without place markers) PAKRATed into the map\r\n-No gun racks\r\n-No exploding bridge\r\n-More fast paced fun!"
