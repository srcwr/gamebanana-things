	"_sText": "Hi, this map is a very unique jail which is located somewhere in space, there are many fun things to do and executions :\r\n- Space skating, showesrs, borixon says, lab, medic. space knifing ring, deagle for deagle, tower, armory, disco, soccer, pool, cinema, electric chair and few secrets.\r\n\r\nIf a prisoner tries to run and jump to space he will be teleported to a mini jail which can be opened/closed.\r\n\r\nThis map`s FPS is not really good but i did put much time to improve it, please dont rate it  on the FPS, i will try to improve it a little bit more in future version.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 random things that can spawn behind the buttons to open cell, Claws which deal damage, jetpack or a laser knife! Theres 50%50 that anything will spawn.\r\n\r\nThe map has custom animations and music, thats why the file is so big.\r\n\r\nYou can improve regeneration in Medic by discovering new cures in the lab.\r\n\r\nMap runs ok with about 20 people, as i said before ill try to imrpove it later on.\r\n\r\n- In next v i will improve the soccer\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to Saitek which made a beautiful job making custom decals for the map!\r\nAlso huge thanks goes to mighty pete for his awesome skybox!"
