Its now scaled down to fit the normal texture\r\n-3D Skybox Water position. Now fits perfectly\r\nADDED:\r\n-Many little plants to make it more Island-like\r\n-trigger_hurt behind every house to prevent camping behind those! Does 4 hp damage each half a second!\r\nCHANGED:\r\n-Where the palms are. This map is no more symmetric!\r\n-The Island is not a block anymore: it now is more rounded\r\n-The Island is a bit bigger now\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\nNow on version v2.2\r\nFIXED: CT's werent hurt when ducking in the water\r\nCHANGED: Height of trigger_hurt on net to prevent low gravity overjumping!\r\npls redownload!\r\n\r\nNow the orginal description:\r\n\r\nThis is my second map! Its a HE_ map. You are playing on a island in the middle of the ocean. To get grenades you have to walk to the little stations located at the water. Its not allowed to touch the net/go past it/jump over it! Doing so will kill you!\r\nCredits: nzero for the palm model\r\nThe rest is original stuff.\r\nHave much fun!\r\n\r\nMap made by Suicide Man 2oo7"
