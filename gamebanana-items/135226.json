	"_sText": "This is a remake of Stryker's fy_funtimes. The biggest change from funtimes is the bottom area underneath the generic funtimes layout. Spawns are significantly lower in order to prevent spawn camping with access to both the \"normal\" level and the bottom level. Rather than ladders for access to the tops of the 4 main boxes, I used stairs. Also, next to those stairs there is access to the bottom area. On the sides of the map where the typical blocking wall is, there is a breakable box to make it hard for people to sit behind the whole time. \r\n\r\nIf you upload it to your server or modify it please post here or pm me! I'd love to hear about it."
