	"_sText": "This hosties map is based in a park-like area with a subway area located beneath the main playing field. The CT's start above ground who must prepare for and escort the T's from the prison transport. The T's can either exit once the transport via a main door opened by the CT's or take a secondary route that leads underneath the train cart into a vent onto the other side of the subway inaccessible by the CT's. From there, the T's can hold up or teleport to the rebel house for some good old fashion gunfighting. This map has all the requirements to play the hosties game type.\r\n\r\n- Arena for chicken and knife fights\r\n- Shot for shot platforms located just in front of CT spawn\r\n- 1-way wall for Simon Says and other games\r\n- Gun Toss wedge located next to 1-way wall\r\n- 4 jail cells with windowed roofs\r\n\r\n*This map has no secrets or Easter Eggs\r\n\r\nThis map sponsored by intox.
