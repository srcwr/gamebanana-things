There are hidden awps and paras behind spawn on the tubes, as well as a buyzone. You start with shotguns, and on both sides of the map there are m4s and ak47s. On top of the are with those weapons there are auto snipers as well. When you fall you go back to ct spawn if your a ct and t spawn if your a t. There is also two bomb sites for you to plant bombs, the only way to get there though is to spawn hop. That is pretty much it, hope you like it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CISArhFShs"
