	"_sText": "Square style room. Equal as possible. Doors that make noises. Needs 2 fixes. 1 door may spam if you press e and walk into at the same time. Prepare fix in Final version. Middle room in final will be avaliable not as a secret. Pretty good lighting. No HDR OR SKYBOX . Good cover. Good map for knife vs guns. First Map by Quadeye Knight but has been made ages ago and since then this is the first of about 20 maps so more releases coming :D. Assess.:D"
