(See laser you pass under the nose ... a must!) \r\n\r\nOtherwise, this is my first map on source and there is insufficient time to the pofiner ... If its interest I have the original file on my PC) \r\n\r\nN'Ã©siter has not give your opinion. \r\n\r\nOtherwise the map starts with CT and Terro in the same room but separated by an impenetrable wall transparent by the bullets and players. \r\n\r\nYou must then direct you in a room to get the P90 and kevlar (with the gun). \r\n\r\nYou then lead to a staircase that descends 2 storeys before you find in the labyrinth TK has the opposing Terrorist course. \r\n\r\nThe door closes behind you and impossible to retrieve ... We must now confront the enemy! \r\n\r\nOf course, if ever there are AFK, a button located in the middle of the map can kill them ... \r\n\r\nVoilou! Enjoy!\r\n\r\nPS : I FORGOT TEXTURE IN FIRST *.RAR ... IT'S GOOD NOW ... SORRY FOR MY FIRST UPLOAD ..."
