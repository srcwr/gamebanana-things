The D in d-dust stands for dynamic. This map is different each round. There are literally millons of ways ways this map can appear.\r\n\r\nEach crate, ladder, door and even some walls are dynamic. The map is dust-themed and has everything you would expect of a gungame map.\r\n\r\n*Changes in V2* \r\n-Tweaked out the dynamic stuff\r\n-Added stuff to close of areas\r\n-Changed odds on a lot of things\r\n-Fixed minor bugs\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\nSmOoth\r\n"
