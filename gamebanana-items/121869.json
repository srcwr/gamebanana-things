In the center of the map you will see a platform with a light above it. This platform is thecapture point. Each team starts with 150 points that tic down every second. First team to 0 loses. By taking the capture point you can stop your teams ticker from ticking. In order to take the capture point, it must be clear of people from the other team, it takes 10 seconds to capture the point. Afterwards you can leave the point and it will remain yours untill a member of the opposing team stands on it for 10secs.\r\n\r\nLosers Die, winners Live :D\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\nThe Kosher Pork for setting up Beta testing, and intox.
