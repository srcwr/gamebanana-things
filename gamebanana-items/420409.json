Terrorists have made themselves known in the streets &amp; alleyways of Gman City, causing chaos left and right, ultimately making the place desserted. The only people that remain are the terrorists &amp; a bunch of CT's ready to stop them. Will they survive?&nbsp;<br><br>Please note: There is no objective for this map, just a fun little level to kill your friends. Enjoy :))"
