Trying to bring back the combat map over the monotonous skill-surf. I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nBombsite enables at bottom of map after a minute and thirty seconds. Included mostly to truncate long rounds times. Most weapons are include in the map, but more importantly, there are enough shotguns for everyone :).\r\n\r\ndesigned for 66 tick, 150 airaccelerate\r\n\r\nComments/critisicm are welcome, as always.\r\n\r\n"
