The multigame spawn/selection area has a bit of a twist to it compared to any generic multigame spawn with 5 random ways (3 climb, 1 hunt the creeper face and lava run) of 'getting chosen'.\r\n\r\nBefore we go any further id like to thank <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/members/553201\">ProfessorOak</a> for letting me work on his map with him (which he originally started for his own multigame map), which progressed into this collaboration map that you are viewing right now, massive amount of respect to him.</font>\r\n\r\n<CENTER><h1><font color=\"DarkOrange\">MAP INFO</font></h1></CENTER>\r\n<font color=\"LightGreen\">\r\nThere are 15 levels that the 'winner' can select from by standing on the pressure pad in front of the level and then pressing 'e' on the map picture. The map has an auto picker setup for 60 seconds if nothing has been picked already. However although there are only 15 maps you will only be able to select 14 of them UNLESS YOU ARE RUNNING THE PLUGIN that comes in the .zip file.\r\n\r\nThanks to kaemon who found this out, the music tracks in the map are optional for each client, the clients can totally mute the songs without the need to \"snd_restart\" mid game and lag for 1-2 seconds. They can go into Options -> Audio -> Music Volume, even if you turn this to off for the map you can still hear the game sounds.\r\n\r\nThere are some unique level ideas in this map which we are proud to release such as the 2D race level (big thanks to kaemon for the entity setup and inspiration for the idea from his mg_2d_alpha map that he made like a year ago), 1hp containers is a pretty fun one, OaksWonderland, paulware (inspired by garryware) and more.</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n<CENTER><h1><font color=\"DarkOrange\">PLUGIN INFO - Server owners please read</font></h1></CENTER>\r\n<font color=\"RoyalBlue\">\r\nThis plugin is optional to have on your server, all that it does is handles one of the levels in the map. If its loaded it will unload the paulware stage button so that it can be selected. The plugin keeps track of players 'frags' and assigns the winner of the paulware stage with a weapon. The plugin also has a feature of !songlist too which will print the song name/artist/link to their console. The plugin is only loaded on the \"mg_divine\" prefix name and is not loaded once the map is not running.\r\n\r\nThanks to Bob Loblaw for making the plugin, we have attached the .sp file along with the .smx if you would like to check the code before adding it to your server.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to add the plugin I would also recommend setting the following in your server.cfg if you haven't already as there will be a REALLY SMALL chance of certain cvars being set once the map has changed, if the maps changed (rtv or admin force change) in the small window when the paulware map alters them. Here they are:</font>\r\n<font color=\"White\">\r\n\r\n- sv_friction 4\r\n\r\n- sv_accelerate 5\r\n\r\n- phys_timescale 1</font>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"lightgreen\">\r\nAgain id also like to thank <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/members/553201\">ProfessorOak</a> for giving me the opportunity to get back into mapping, he was the one who had already had 9 base levels before getting me involved. We think that the map is great fun to play on and we hope you guys enjoy it. Feedback is appreciated and thanks for downloading/reading if you have!</font>\r\n\r\n<CENTER><h1><font color=\"DarkOrange\">Change Log</font></h1></CENTER>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"DarkOrange\">v1</font>\r\n<font color=\"RoyalBlue\">First version of map released.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n\r\n- 2d level - no damage trigger not always effective (seen one person die from a knife)</font>"
