Imo the map was way to big so i decided to create a smaller version...and here is the result. \r\n\r\nit is better than the big version, because:\r\n\r\n+it contains a lot of cubemaps\r\n+some props and debris brushes\r\n+2 mini fountains (just water bowls)\r\n+way better lightning...now you will see everything and everyone. \r\n\r\nEnjoy! 32 Players maximum"
