	"_sText": "Hello all.<br><br>This map is inspired by the maps bhop_shitper, xyz, etc. Maps by zyper but also people who made maps that combined maps of their own into one. I did a similar thing, except each theme is related to, but not the same as each map as I made. Also, the gameplay is different. There is only one spot that copy and pasted from another map. That is the last climb on the 2nd stage.<br><br>Stages: 9 Stages<br>Bonus: One bonus<br><br>Not entirely sure how long it is, but it is my biggest map thus far.<br>Thank you to all that helped."
