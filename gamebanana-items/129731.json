	"_sText": "Hi, my name is SolDIEr of {Fortune} and this is my first map uploaded to Fpsbanana.\r\n\r\nInspired by some some particular maps, I tried to make a jailbreak map that combined both detail, comfortability and enjoyment. It is fair-sided, but requires a CT with a 'head on his shoulder'. \r\n\r\nI do believe this is unlike any other jailbreak map (that I have at least played). The layout is different, which makes it unique. Uniqueness is a good thing in my eyes. You'll notice that T's need to swim under CT spawn just to get to big cage. There a door opens which allows them to a hallway leading outside.\r\n\r\nI do hope you enjoy this map. Feedback is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-its soldier time"
