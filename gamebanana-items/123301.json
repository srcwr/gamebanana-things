	"_sText": "This is my first publicly released map.  It is meant to be a simple, fun, fast paced combat map.  I wanted to make map where it was possible to gain a lot of speed, and to reward players for going fast.  An example of this is that it is possible to land in the AWP box just by surfing and hitting the teleporters correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you use this map on your server, please tell me the name/IP of the server.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank everyone who tested the map and gave me ideas to fix problems/make the map better."
