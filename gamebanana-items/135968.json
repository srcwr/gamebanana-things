	"_sText": "GG_nuketown is based on the Call of Duty Black Ops map with the same name.  It is not a complete remake, as the interiors of the houses are different, but its layout and overall feel is about the same.\r\n\r\nWithin the first minute of each round, an airplane will drop a care package somewhere in the center of the map.  These care packages serve as a way to bring people to the middle of the arena for more frantic gameplay.  The first player to open the care package will be given a randomly chosen reward.  The crates contain special grenades (2 flashbangs and a smoke grenade), an airstrike that obliterates the opposing team, and the ability to man a helicopter's minigun turret.  While these do not count toward your own score, they will bring your victims down 1 level (in Gun Game) each time they die."
