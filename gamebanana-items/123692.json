The order of the rooms is the same as the order of the code. You will need that code to open secret rooms at the end of the map. There is also another secret room sealed with 2 doors,each door can be destroyed by searching the end area for wooden X signs and shooting them(They are not so obvious so good luck finding them). There is also a demo of the cube in the map which is not so easily reachable. The cube is actually a room where you need to climb to a specific area and the whole cube will rotate for 90 degrees and make new obstacle to climb on. In the next map the cube will have many more levels.good luck and hope you will enjoy this map.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Testers:\r\n<br>FalseProphet\r\n<br>d347hm4n\r\n<br>malikarlo\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you have any questions contact me \r\n<br>on: <a href=\"mailto:grave.productions@gmail.com\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">grave.productions@gmail.com</a>"
