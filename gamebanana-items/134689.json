	"_sText": "This map is specifically made for DZK (Deutscher Zocker Kreis) but may well be enjoying to play for other servers aswell. Like said it is a small tribute map for a gungame server of them.\r\nIt gets it's name from the topview, where you can read the letters \"D Z K\" in the form of a house and swimming pool. There's a little monitor in the house that shows the topview aswell (aswell as players who walk about outside).\r\n\r\nAlso this map is my first map that contains a custom radar, meaning you can pinpoint the positions of spotted enemies on the minimap (aswell as the overview when spectating). It is a little buggy at the CT-spawn, but it functions alright."
