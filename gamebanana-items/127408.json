	"_sText": "Hey this is a deathrun map I made. It contains 15 traps and a few traps i havent seen in any other dr map. Though I havent seen every dr map.\r\n\r\nThe second trap can only be passed by throwing a nade through a small hole in the wall.\r\n\r\nThe barnacles have animations and sound.\r\n\r\nThe HL2 Dog trap has animations and sounds. Its player controlled and throws barrels. It has to be knifed to death to pass. You cant use the dog trap button if theres more than one person near it, i had it lock because if 2 people get in the trap it will crash your server when it dies.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the things I'll let you discover since I dont want to bore you with a long essay. Check out the screenshots they should help you get somewhat of a grasp of the map. I didnt use any prefabs in the map other than for the letters. I dont mind if you decompile the map to see how i made a trap (the barnacles were tricky) but if you're gonna use anything let me know. If you find any glitches/bugs in the map also let me know. The map may be constructed sort of weird, with the walls, but my clan's server has rpg mod and i needed to stop people from bhopping thru all the traps. \r\n\r\nYou can also find the map on this 69.9.43.102:27015 server.
