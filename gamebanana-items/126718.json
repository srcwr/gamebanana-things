Has the all the basic hosties needs:\r\n\r\n- 3 jail cells\r\n- Gun toss\r\n- Shot for shot (2 platforms over looking the whole map)\r\n- 1-way wall for simon-says and other such games\r\n- Arena for chicken and knife fights (hanging between SFS platforms)\r\n- Secondary escape route for rebels\r\n\r\nI also added a raceway with multiple obstacles to overcome for some added challenges. \r\n\r\nUnlike my other maps, this map has no secret area or any other type of Easter Egg to find. \r\n\r\nThis map sponsored by intox.
