This is a rats style birthday cake map made in honor of the -=JGC=- (Joint Ghost Commandos)Clan's 4th birthday.  The JGC clan is full of talented players and mappers.  Please pay us a visit at www.jgcclan.net. We are always looking for great new recruits!  Also check out the -=JGC=- Clan server:\r\n\r\n-=JGC=- Clan Server -Recruiting- FastDL\r\n8.12.16.219:27015\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nThe Mission\r\n----------------------\r\nThe terrorists have crashed the much anticipated -=JGC=- birthday party and they brought their shrinking device!!!After shrinking everyone in sight to \"rat size\", their goal is to blow up the birthday cake and ruin the party. There are some in the terrorist group who desire to hear the \"Voice of God\" from the Land of Cans . The only way to summon the voice is by successfully detonating the bomb at the cake's summit.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Destroy one of the two bomb targets, but real men only go for the top. Kill any CTs in your way.\r\n\r\nCounter-T's: Prevent the T's from planting the bomb and protect the \"Voice of God\" at all costs.\r\n\r\nFYI - The sprinkles are climbable and the archways lead you inside the cake.  \r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nCredits\r\n----------------------\r\nSwampy Turtle -  For a ton of great ideas and support in developing the cake.\r\nThe JGC Clan\r\nCanMan - The Voice of God\r\nThe Plank Owners Club\r\nThe Ninja Club\r\nThe Viking Club"
