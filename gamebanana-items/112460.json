It also includes the ball being lifted off the floor slightly to counter the change in crouch hight that made the previous version not work as well.  In short, the ball hovers slightly.\r\n\r\nDo not use bots on here and for servers it is best to download the CunningStunt football plug-in, which is available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sourceaddiction.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=22\r\n\r\nIt uses a combination of custom and standard textures, all of the custom ones are BSP zipped for your convenience.\r\n\r\nHave fun and look out for fy_football_2007!!!\r\n\r\nBTW the origional concept is indeed the one done by Lolobubu, whom has thanks based inside the map and my thanks here for coming up with the idea."
