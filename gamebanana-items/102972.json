I included it so you don't have to spend the 15 min setting up the bots for the first time.\r\n\r\n- de_lochs2.txt:\r\nThis file contains the text you see at the beginning of the map. You know the text that no one reads?\r\n\r\nThe custom textures I created for this map have been compiled into the bsp file so there is no need for a res file. What a pain that was...\r\n\r\nA special \"thanks\" ester egg room has been included in the map for who are adventerous enough to find it. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of changes, new routes, new places to hide, more detail. And above all I have optimized the holy crap out of the map using every trick I know how to use. I even used a few I had no clue could be done before =) It runs great all of the test machines, so if you encounter poor FPS it will be news to me =P\r\n\r\n===========================\r\nDownload VERSION 2.0 and view CURRENT screen shots:\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nhttp://www.vigville.com/de_lochs/"
