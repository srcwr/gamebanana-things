	"_sText": "This map can hold up to 40 players. It unludes a skybox, an easter egg which is a teleporter taht will teleport you to the highest point on the map which will give you an advanctage over everyone else. This map is fairly large and the blocks were strategically places to make the gameplay fun but also fast. There is a sniping tower on both the T and CT side which can be accessed by climbing the brick wall on the back of it. The CT side is harder to access the inside than the T side since the CTs have an advange over the Ts with how I set up the blocks. So to get to the sniper tower on the CT side, you must teleport yourself to the tall tower on the CT side and jump from it to the CT sniper tower building. Then you jump from the roof onto the floor of the sniper tower. To get into the T sniper tower you just simply climb up in it.\r\n\r\nI did include a .nav file with this map so that you won't have to make one yourself. Just download this then extract the file you downlaoded into your maps file and you can then get into game and play it."
