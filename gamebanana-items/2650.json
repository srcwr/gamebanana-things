	"_sText": "A simple eight-wheeled APC, resembling a Stryker or a BTR. Shoot the buttons to open the various hatches in the vehicle. The prefab has been made into a func_tracktrain; get on the driver's seat, use the steering wheel and press forward & backward to drive. Features engine & driving sounds and rotating wheels. Notice that the wheels and sounds must be triggered to stop by the first and last path_tracks of the APC's path, or they will keep rolling. This has been done in the prefab map's track set."
