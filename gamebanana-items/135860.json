Thanks for the textures.\r\n\r\nI never added the textures to the .bsp before so people were getting pink and black squares, so added them now with PakRat.\r\n\r\nSpawn Points: 48\r\n\r\n[UPDATE] I  found that the author of the textures i used was Chris528, so i've changed this note to reflect it."
