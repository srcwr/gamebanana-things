Still I have provided enough spawns for 32 players.\r\n\r\nMission Briefing:\r\n\r\nDE_DECOY_V3 - by Edward \"Aufo\" Fuller\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDecoy - Bomb/Defuse\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: The small dock\r\nradar has discovered a number of\r\nun-scheduled visitors. We will secure\r\nall sensitive areas and eliminate any\r\nthreat to the installation.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Our target is a decoy to\r\ndraw the eye of the American government\r\nfrom our real targets that will be hit\r\nlater today!\r\n\r\nOther Notes: There are 2 bomb targets\r\nin the mission."
