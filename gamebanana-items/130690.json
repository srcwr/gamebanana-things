Hope you will really enjoy it.&nbsp;<br><br>The map contains just 1 STAGE, but this STAGE is like 20-30 minutes long.<br>Also the map has difficulties (NG, NG+,NG+2, etc.), like when you beat NG (first difficulty), the NG+ will be enabled.<br><br>The map has 4 bosses ported from the game.<br><br>It contains 12 human items and 2 zombie items<br><br>The map trailer:<br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2oYo7i7hJ8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br><br>Also, why it isn't full or partial port. Because we made all the locations ourself, and they greately differ from the game. But on the other side, they are like the game.<br><br>Our mapping blog, where you can learn more info about our mapping:<br><br>https://steamcommunity.com/groups/headshooterandlonlly<br><br>P.S. Hopefully the map will get the CS:GO version, not fully sure yet"
