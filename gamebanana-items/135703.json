	"_sText": "This is a Gun Game Map in the Location from a Maya Tempel. There are 2 Overpass on the Sides and you can walk over the Tempel too. Under the Tempel is a Grave Room. I have all symetric build on the Map, i think its better for the fair Gameplay. I have the Hammer Files put in the Pack, so you can costum the Map. Enjoy and have fun. If somebody put my Map on his Server, plz tell me this, i like to play my Map online with other People. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Edit from the_kyom : \"ERROR\" from the original \"gg_maya\" fixed (so called gg_maya_fixed ^^)\r\n<br>bugged texture tree, I replaced the tree by one from militia from the official gcf, nothing else."
