It's a totally reworked and carefully optimized (hand-tuned) .nav-file because in original map author's archive was included simple auto-gen.<br><br>More than a half of all areas were created manually because during an auto-generation processing the majority of them were constructed incorrectly or incomplete. Also much attention was paid to exact connections of paths in the conditions of limited space.<br><br>Well... bots have opportunity to use all walkable ways and they surely move according to all areas of the map despite narrowness. So you twist the head extensively at the same time! :D<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map author available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/166539\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also all your responses and remarks are always welcomed :-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nRedbodega (for fine designed and modern styled office-themed map, also for his other nice maps).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Happy Frags and More Fun!<br>\r\n<br>"
