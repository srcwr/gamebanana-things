	"_sText": "This is just an remake of the orginal TwoTowers, Same like the remakes \"2009\" \"night\" \"32\" Now we made the \"DoubleTrouble\"\r\n\r\nWe made it 2 towers each spawn within each tower 2 sniper platforms, In the middle are fake boxes where you can hide it and the looks are made from stone,\r\n\r\nAlso the weapons on the wooden wall from the original \"m4a1\" ( ct side ) \"Ak-47\" ( T side ) are gone and the weapons on both spawn in the water are gone \"Mp-5\"\r\n\r\nWe did this cause people would make adventages of it and would try to reach those weapons as first, then they would swim back up and end up with an bullet right between there eyes.\r\n\r\nSo for those issues we deleted the weapons and just make this map fight for your lives and kill the tower campers."
