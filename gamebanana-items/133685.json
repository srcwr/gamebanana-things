	"_sText": "The Eight release of my Aperture Science series!\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple map I made using all I've learned in doing my Aperture Science Map series. It is a nonsymetrical map and its of small/medium size. This is to allow for a tight, fast action packed gun game game to happen.\r\n\r\nI decided no to include actual portals because it could unbalance the game and because they take a lot of work to do, however if you think I should add them, I will on the next version release. So any feedback, I mean ALL feedback is encouraged\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Eugenio 'Motanum' Roman\r\nBugs, comments, suggestions to agent_2114@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n**If you take this map for your server online DONT FORGET TO SEND ME YOUR I.P. address so I CAN JOIN along!\r\n\r\nNext instalment on my Aperture Science Series will hopefully be a pay load for team fortress 2! Any Ideas on other type of maps? tell me agent_2114@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nSponsored by ]HeLL[ Clan\r\n\"Born in Heaven, Living in ]HeLL[\"\r\n\r\nSee screenshots\r\n\r\nInstallation, just paste the all of the files in the ZIP on your maps folder for Counter Strike Source\r\n\r\nDefault should be Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\Account_Name\\Counter Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps"
