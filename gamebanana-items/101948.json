It was a long, and highly tedious process but I am pleased with the result.<br>\r\n To display my progress throughout the project I have recorded a time-lapse of the entire project. From the first steps all the way to final optimization. This video will be posted either tomorrow or later in the week \\- as soon as I have time.<br>\r\n<h3>The Map</h3>\r\n The map is fully optimized, containing spawnpoints to support up to 64 players and includes a wide range of custom content and ideas. The map also features a dynamic sandstorm system to vary the standard gameplay of de\\_dust2.<br>\r\n The overall game objective remains the same, Plant and defuse \\- at the same locations as the original map, though that doesn\\'t mean a lot has not changed\\...<br>\r\n The Terrorists managed to successfully bomb B Square at Mars, 2016 \\- resulting in a war between 2016 \\- 2020 within the country. Over the next twenty years the majority of the country was rebuilt; though the streets of dust were left as rubble.<br>\r\n The year is now 2082. A reconstruction company have found and begun reconstruction of the lost town attempting to recreate the buildings to their former charm. During this long process they stumbled across crates containing the remnants of a unique weapon from the previous. A weapon so powerful that it could remove the whole region from the map. Don't let the terrorists ruin this, defend the areas and get away with those crates, before they do the same.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Features:</h3><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>64 Spawnpoints</li>\r\n<li>color correction</li>\r\n<li>custom .nav file for bots</li>\r\n<li>soundscapes</li>\r\n<li>custom textures <i>(a few)</i></li>\r\n<li>loads of detail</li>\r\n<li>a well optimized level</li>\r\n<li>custom motd</li>\r\n<li>custom radar overview</li>\r\n<li>HDR</li>\r\n<li>3D skybox</li>\r\n<li><b>Sandstorms!</b> <i>spawning randomly after 90sec</i></li>\r\n<li>and more</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nPlease rate, comment, subscribe and wish me the best of luck in the contest!<br>\r\n\r\nI hope you like it!<br>\r\n\r\nCheers! - Alex<br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h2>Timelapse Video:</h2>\r\n<h4>Fast version</h4>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/qrSwIZA1HfM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h4>Long Version:</h4>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8HX4MhXnw4&feature=channel_video_title\">Part 01</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWx97j4khfM&feature=channel_video_title\">Part 02</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ2qbrIcHAM&feature=channel_video_title\">Part 03</a>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/anotherwaytodoit?feature=mhee#p/a/u/0/dGiz39ZHcyU\">Part 04</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzB6hH63ma8\">Part  05</a></br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVtGO4m07MI\">Part 06</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XDh03R53ao&feature=channel_video_title\">Part 07</a><br>"
