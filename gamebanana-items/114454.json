	"_sText": "A 3 level map based around an old station for a petroleum company. The 3 levels comprise of sewers, the ground level (mostly outside, plus a corridor and storage room), and an office on the first floor. Has a rainy enviroment with some distant fog, part hillside part city location.\r\n\r\nLots of routes and a lot more complicated/fun than iceworld/poolparty. Took about 3-4 weeks to make.\r\n\r\nGive it a go on your servers, it's sure to be a good'un.\r\n\r\nI've optimised it, average FPS was 60+ (lowest 40-50fps)."
