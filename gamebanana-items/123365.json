If it is, i will continue work on it(add details, stuff and maybe secret), if not, i will do another map.\r\nIt is still wip and very experimental map, gameplay reminds Russian roulette game. You'll understand why when you will play map!\r\nAnyway, this map is still playable.\r\nIt has 64 slots, buyzones, big breakable wall to your pleasure(i could do it bigger but compilator start whine! DAMN IT!) and small surprise in the centre of the map, beware!\r\nSurprise activates after 1 minute from match start, be fast!"
