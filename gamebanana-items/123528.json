Contains re-textured walls as seen in screen shot D, breakable boxes, and phys prop barrels and exploding barrels as seen in screen shot B, more ways to get through as seen in screen shot E, and dust skybox as seen in screen shot C. The cheater's box now has a fence to show people can't get in the room, as I have seen that MANY people want to...   can't imagine why...\r\n\r\n "
