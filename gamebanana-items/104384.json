But keep in mind i will not change enything cause this is a closed Project for me. But if you want to change, you can. There is no decompiling \"Blocker\". But if you change something please give me the credits.\r\n\r\nThe Counter-Strike Map (Original) made by someone other. I don't know the Name of the Mapper.\r\nAnyway, have fun with my newest creation. \r\n\r\nP.s. 2 Days are very short, so there are some effects missing. No HDR, Environment Sounds and Performance optimizings."
