Think of it as a big, free roaming surf map. The grey boxes at the end are teleports. \r\n\r\nThe map is buggy, and not all the slopes function properly, and it's pretty basic. It took less then 30 minutes to make.\r\n\r\nBut whatever... put sv_airaccelerate to 100, and sv_friction to > 3 (preferably 1). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
