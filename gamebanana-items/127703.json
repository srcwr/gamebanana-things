	"_sText": "The idea of this map is for the CT's to run across the map.\r\nThere are a couple of boxes in their way.\r\nThey can acces 2 hidden scouts.\r\nAt the end of the run there's an invisible teleport just before the pit.\r\nThis teleport will teleport them behind the T's where they can get a Glock or Usp.\r\nWhen they have the guns they can kill the T's.\r\nIf done correct, CT's will win the round.\r\nThe T's have to shoot the CT's while they run trough the boxes.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nMap by: Mr.Fishy\r\nIdea by: Apex\r\nThanks to: 3kliksphilip, for your very helpfull tutorials.\r\nSpecial thanks to: Valve, for releasing Source SDK."
