Still need to incorporate some form of cover to the sides a bit and finish off something of a 3d skybox I think.\r\n\r\nThere are errors still in the map, noticed them in my first few times loading it, ie CT spawn building, bad reflects due to no cubemaps and func_details. Along with misshapen brush's here and there that need to be fixed.\r\n\r\n<b class=\"red\">Map is not done, map is NOT Perfect so no 10's this time around please....</b>\r\n\r\nEnjoy and feel free to send feedback and ideas to myself if you wish,\r\nLogan \"TheLost\" Dougall (ghost.in.the.crowd@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n<div><center><a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" property=\"dc:title\">wmd_outpost_v2</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/109641\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Logan Dougall</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike 2.5 Canada License</a>.<br />Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/109641\" rel=\"cc:morePermissions\">Here</a>.</center></div>"
