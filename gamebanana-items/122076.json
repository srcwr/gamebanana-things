This map has been one of the longest projects I've had so far. More than two years have passed, since my friend JackTheStripper had the idea to remake this map and gave me some ideas. In those two years I've optimized the map in every aspect.\r\nThe map has been re-created from scratch and has many new ways - but still the basic idea of Forbidden Ways: <br>With more than twenty secrets to explore - some harder, some easier - and the typical 'Get a gun, surf to jail' principle, you'll have HOURS of varied gameplay. The far you surf, the better weapons you get, but if you fail, you'll end up being in jail.\r\n<br><div align=center><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3EUrd-pNhEQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n<p>Information:</p><ul><li>More than twenty secrets to discover.</li><li>Beautiful redesign and awesome ambience.</li><li>More than 3.5 minutes of total surfing-time.</li><li>Teamplay map: Some places are only reachable with the help of one of your teammates.</li><li>Advanced gameplay: Some parts of the map will change from time to time. Get advantages by using secret ways and special weapons.</li><li>Balanced complexity of the surfing parts for beginners and experts.</li><li>Now there is a way to get out of jail without any help.</li><li>Optimized for Mods (such as RPG and DM).</li><li>I've been 0.7% below max_planes, so please note how difficult it was to add details.</li></ul>\r\n-Krusty\r\n\r\n<center><a href=http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/download/137826><img src=http://www.imgbox.de/users/PRGAG/fwrld/download.png></a></center>\r\n<hr size=1>\r\n\r\n<b class=red>Dear noclippers and spectators,</b><br>\r\nI have spent a lot of time to make this map as entertaining as possible by creating all the secrets\r\nfor you to figure out.
