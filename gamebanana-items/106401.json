	"_sText": "Just a quick map i whipped up, has some influence from the classic aim_heashot from 1.6, and also some influence from my housebattle map. the setting is 2 abandoned cabins, which somehow have computers inside with working lights, and some destroyed walls etc. for cover outside. very simple gameplay, but also very fun\r\n\r\nEDIT: sorry that the screenies arent to high of quality, its just that my resolution is too high for fpsb =D"
