It is on the easy end of tier 6 and is about 40 seconds long to nofail.<br><br>The detailing is inspired by art deco elements in Fallout and Bioshock games. The name of the map was intially going to have a lot more influence on the theme, but the direction changed quite a bit, leaving only the little icons of bugs on the walls of each stage.<br><br>server/zone configuration:<br><br>The only non-standard zone is the stage 4 start zone.
