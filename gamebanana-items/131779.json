	"_sText": "<b>Story</b>\r\nA large bridge in Europe has been hit by a strange object that first seemed to be a meteor.\r\nBut it came out that this rock was filled with an unknown organic and even moving liquid, which turns humans into zombies by slipping through the ears inside their brains.\r\n\r\nYou, member of a special group, should clear out the hostile liquid and infected humans to banish all risks.\r\n\r\n(Unluckily, as we already now, one member of the group became alien and then infected the others who are trying to save themselves now...)\r\n\r\n<b>FPS</b>\r\nI got about 60 FPS everywhere, sometimes even 110, although my comp is quite old.. so it wont lag while playing online.\r\n\r\n<b>Slots</b>\r\nThere are 64 starting points and it at least works with 40 players (didnt try on an even bigger server)\r\n\r\nHave fun playing!! 50ae"
