The Map has 4 Main Corridors, and  the 2 bigger Corridors are the Spawnpoints for the Fractions. At the small Carridor on the Main Side i have put the Reception, with 2 little indoor Waterfalls (the Textures are in the Pack). And at the other small Corridor i have put the Toilettes with a broken Wall (you can go trough), and a Pipe System there pulls the Steam out. The Offices are in the Center from the Map. There is a Conference Room with some Couches and Tables in the Center too. You can see the costum PC Model and the Marijuhana Plant on my Screenes, the Stuff isnt in the Pack, you have the old Models. You can play the Map with 32 People.\r\n\r\nI hope you like the Map, Have Fun\r\n\r\nOur skillor\r\n\r\n---!-U-P-D-A-T-E-D-!---!-U-P-D-A-T-E-D-!---!-U-P-D-A-T-E-D-!---"
