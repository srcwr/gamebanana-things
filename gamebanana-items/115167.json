	"_sText": "Hey yall!  This is my first attempt at mapping.  I wanted to make something basic, and simple for my first time.  This map was geared toward the player who likes iceworld and other maps similar, thoes who like fast paced, guns blazing, frag fests hehe.  If this map does decent ill expand the map, add support for 32 players, and also add in some extra touches.  I hope yall like it.  let me know whatcha think.\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/\">\r\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n<br />This work is licensed under a \r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License</a>."
