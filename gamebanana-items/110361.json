The bricks are the the confusing part (hence the maze of confusion) and success on the map relies heavily on ambushing and outsmarting opponents.  You are welcome to use this map on any of your maps.  Just be sure to include my name (tbpfj8.)\r\nP.S.  My next map will be more epic and will be released this December."
