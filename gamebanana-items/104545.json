There was a couple texture bugs and also some route bugs too. I added two new routes to help both teams to get bombsites mch easier.\r\n\r\nAlso fine tuned T's door too so now it open much more that earlier.\r\nClosed one route with fences cuase it was meaningless.\r\n\r\nIf you find bugs or something unusual please contact me so i can fix those."
