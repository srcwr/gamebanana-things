The room you spawn in, is kind of a tactical room with a tiny slit in the wall to shoot out of, also, there is a tunnel connecting ct spawn to t spawn.. and vice versa. You have a ladder next to you, where you can climb up or down.. Going down will take you to a neon blue bomb plant room filled with water (yes yes, a water bomb plant, pimp, I know), there are ledges for tactical camping lining the upper walls of the water room.  Up will lead you to a smoke filled, dark, red bomb plant zone. This is comprised of a catwalk and crates, and a fort, for cover. Both the catwalk and the ground are plantable.\r\n\r\nThe possible tactics of this map, the neon lighting, and just the sheer fun of this map is reason enough to give it a try.\r\n\r\nShout out to Heretique, Eksdee, and a huge thanks to Deadman-Sama, for helping me test the map in its pubescent stages and posing in screenshots.\r\n\r\n"
