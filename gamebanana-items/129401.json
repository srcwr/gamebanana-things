However, there is no great choice! in the pool is a small shaft leading to the armory. so you have a good overview of the cell, there are around a small gang of the ct's. of course there is a healing chamber in which to heal itself. a small secret room is also available.\r\n(you have to duck through a small crate next to the vending machines)\r\n\r\nmuch fun playing with!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyour mapper: dackelmausente1995\r\n\r\nschullerd@hotmail.de"
