	"_sText": "NEW VERSION UPLOADED!\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Map starts with a hard climbing part, but I added a \"noob\" way on the top of the glass with a ladder and a holding spot.\r\n\r\n- After first climb part there's 2 portals, each of them goes to a different stage.\r\n\r\n- After this 2 stages there's a converging part where all ct's fight together again.\r\n\r\n- On the final of this stage there's teleport for the boss arena, but there's 3 possible ends that are randomly chosen. The middle one is a boss fight and the other two are normal escapes.\r\n\r\n- Also, there are 3 special weapons. (Cool'r and 2 builders).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Enviolinador for the textures and for all the help he provided me.\r\n\r\nThank you for all the feedback provided in the other version.\r\n\r\nV2:\r\n\r\n- Fixed sound files, now you can turn music on/off by using options - audio - music volume.\r\n\r\n- Added a 3D Skybox.\r\n\r\n- Fixed bugs and changed some holding spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nIt's my first ze map, and pretty much the first \"serious\" map I make. Would appreciate any feedback."
