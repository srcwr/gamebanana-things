	"_sText": "Update to my previous release zm_HL2_Prison. Changed name to more catchy zm_cell_games and did some modifications. If you have questions regarding the map, message me on Steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap can be played in 2 modes depending on whenever cell doors open or not. If the doors are closed then accessible map is small which gives zombies advantage. If they are open then humans should have advantage. There \"is\" 5/9 chance that the doors will be open. I was motivated to created a smaller, dynamic map which will still be fun to play even when there are less players on the server. Map is best suited for 5-35 players.\r\n\r\nMap offers variety of locations. From barricade to hold, jump and even few secrets. At first glance there are not many good options for humans but experienced players should have no problem with finding something to work with. There are also some not too obvious barricade locations which give some room for innovation."
