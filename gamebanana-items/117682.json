	"_sText": "This map is 100% symmetrical and features the Measure textures for a clean artistic style. dm_vertigo is a mid to close quarters map but also has some snipers nests. This map also has what is called *DMM or Digital Molecular Matter. It is not true DMM but has elements that true DMM hosts. DMM is the ability not to just break an object, but to individually break down pieces of the structure eventually into rubble. This makes game play varied fun.\r\n\r\n*An example of DMM: There are barriers that completely hide the player when hiding behind it. But if you start shooting off pieces of the barrier you can start to see the player and eventually kill him."
