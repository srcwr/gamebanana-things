I wanted to get some feedback about layout/balance before adding in details and lighting and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nNo .nav file included in this version, sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThere are buyzones in the map for testing balance with different guns without the Gun Game mod on.\r\n\r\nto do:\r\nLighting\r\nTrim and texture alignment on the arches\r\nBetter .nav file\r\nImprove displacements\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any feedback concerning layout, balance, possible exploits, and other things of this nature.  Due to some computer problems I am having, this version has not been tested very much.\r\n\r\nadded in temporary lighting\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nadded in some props\r\nmade a brazier in the central area\r\nadded playerclip in some vital areas\r\n\r\napologies for the low quality of the screenshots."
