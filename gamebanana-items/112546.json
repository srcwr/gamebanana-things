	"_sText": "After several failed attempts to reach Stryker who made this map originally in 2005 as a remake of ice-world.\r\n\r\nI decided to update it myself. My friend =EZ= made the radar overview. The auto-generated nav file that was with the game allowed the bots to spawn behind the weapons , and from there they would go single file up the middle with just a pistol or go up the steps and let you fight the other team alone. I redirected the bots over the weapons to even up the sides. \r\n\r\nI believe everyone has probably seen this map before. Since the only things we added to it was the radar and a place-painted nav file that is what the screen shots are of.\r\n\r\nDon't forget there is a buy-zone in the middle highlighted by my cross-hair on the nav screen. Part of the reason I did this is that the original funtimes is no longer on the banana. That just didn't seem right. "
