I DON'T CARE IF YOU HATE, BECAUSE OF THE BUGS!\r\n\r\nI think it's pretty fun, especially if you are playing LAN with friends! \r\n\r\n*EDIT: The house might collapse, at the time you spawn. I have only seen this bug after det CSS update 2010. I don't know if it's bugged for everyone, but please comment if you see this bug too."
