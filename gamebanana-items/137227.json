	"_sText": "This is not a map I made but one that I improved.  The map originally only held 20 players, now it can have 32.  Also if you look at the pictures there are 2 towers, obviously.  People always tended to camp up there and no one could see where they were or kill them for that matter.  I made the top of the towers glass, shown in the pictures.  I also made the sides on top of the tower breakable glass, as shown below.  I hope this stops the camping, enjoy the map guys."
