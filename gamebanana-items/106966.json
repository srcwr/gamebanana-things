It's a small map, but can be difficult do to the lighting I did.\r\n\r\nThe center of the room has a slow flashing red light that goes completely black for a second, so you can't see. Also across the center of the map there is a large hole, that you gotta jump over to get to the other side, but if you fall in, you die.\r\n\r\nI do suggest you use noblock on this map, since the opening to leave spawn is small, so anybody camping there will make it so you can't get out."
