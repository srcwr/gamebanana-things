	"_sText": "Hey guys, this is my first map , hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nkz_bhop_cube is inspired by xc_qube and it is intended to be played on legit normal difficulty 100 tick servers that force sv_airaccelerate 100, fps_max 300, sv_gravity 800 and no scout.\r\n\r\nIt is a medium difficulty map which comprises three rooms with the same difficulties.\r\nIt is short map because the decoration which need a lot of blocks.\r\nTo make the gameplay more interesting , i added checkpoints and gravity triggers for anti-prespeed. I didn't ask badges for his gravity triggers because I knew he was going to make a prefab of it.\r\n\r\nEDIT : I finished adjusting all triggers ,I think this is the latest version,if you find any bugs or scs contact me. LAST VERSION '23/11/2013'\r\nThank to reupload it on your server and not to keep older versions.\r\n \r\nMusic : Free Background Music 12: Dreams (120 bpm)"
