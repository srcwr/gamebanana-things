	"_sText": "I was disappointed that the other Saw maps didn't incorporate enough actual Saw content into them, so I decided to do my own. mg_saw_ultimate features actual sound clips from the movies, real traps from them, and real characters. \r\n\r\nThere are multiple traps to navigate and 'head traps' on some of them, where you will need to complete the course within a given amount of time before it goes off.\r\n\r\nYou must decide at certain points in the map to save or kill certain characters, and your decision could have a vital impact on your success or failure in the level.\r\n\r\nI have added a multitude of invisible buttons on the map that display information to the player when pressed (e.g. pressing E on the body in the spawn room). See if you can find them all! They are typically on objects that stand out, so you don't need to spam press everything you see.\r\n\r\nCan you make it all the way to the end?"
