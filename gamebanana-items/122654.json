	"_sText": "A continuation of the superhappy series. This map is not very new, I just realized that i forgot to put it up on fpsb. Similar to the other maps in the series; surf to gain weapons/advantages in the jail. Re-introduced the 1v1 knife arena to fight for jail release. Automatic release door closes after a timer goes off. The timer is based on how many players are on the map. The map is kind of still in beta, but I am not going to revisit it again.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nVisit solidsurf.info for our mapping forum\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nenjoy, and have a super happy time"
