And they make it to humans with special pleasure! :D<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nLaBello (for nice futuristic industrial-themed map)<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Kill All Humans! Hail To The Bots Of Dawn! :-)\r\n<hr>\r\n<strong>UPDATED 21.10.2014</strong>\r\nGeneral Fixes:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Added Place Names;</li>\r\n<li>Some other minor changes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!</strong><br><br>"
