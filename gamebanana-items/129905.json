Wish the two could combine?<br><br>Hello, my name is [blur], and I've made your dreams come true!<br><br>Presenting......<b> jb_office!</b><br><br>This is a jailbreak map I've been working on, based on cs_office. I started with the cs_office map file, and over the past 2 months, I have been working hard to turn it into a jailbreak map for source! jb_office has:<br><br>Surf, climb, the floor is lava game, deathchair, musical chairs, breakfloor, courtyard, roof access, soccer, pool, underground minigames area, and more! Throughout the map you'll also find various secrets; some are obvious, some not so much.<br><br>Although it's still in beta development, it's mostly done and I've uploaded a stable beta version for playing.<br><br><b>Enjoy!</b><br><br><b><u>Special thanks to Gamepunch.net , this map wouldn't have happened without the GP community!</u></b>"
