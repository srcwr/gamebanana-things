	"_sText": "My brand new T4 staged map. It consists of five stages and two additional bonus stages. <br><br>While the main map is around T4 there are brief portions where the difficulty will dip significantly below and slightly higher than T4. The first additional bonus, created by Sagan, is intended to be approximately T3. The second additional bonus, created by Xtra_Festive, is intended to be approximately T5. <br><br>This is my first ever published map that is reminiscent of older mapping styles and formatting. In my map I integrate small bhop portions to the surf to change things up a bit. I hope to expand on these new ideas and concepts moving forward in my next projects.<br><br>I would like to extend a HUGE thank you and shout out to all of my testers and friends that have answered each and every question and walked me through even the most basic concepts. I would like to especially thank Xtra for his many lessons and bits of feedback and Sagan for consistently motivating me to be the best I can be.<br><br>Thank you so much to anyone who plays this map! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\">An Additional EXTRA thanks to Juxtapo who made the Showcase video as well!</span><br>"
