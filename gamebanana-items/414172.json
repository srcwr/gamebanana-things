Didn't do any external testing besides myself. hopefully there isn't anything map breaking or gross, but I did go through it quite a bit myself. I think the map is fun personally, and there are a couple of optional routes scattered throughout the map. I attempted to balance them but we will see if that worked. Enjoy!<br><br>let me know if there are any issues.<br><br>edit: made the map in a day and a half. map name is indicative to how I feel about life atm"
