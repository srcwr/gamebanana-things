	"_sText": "It's been almost a year since my last release, and this is mainly because of school and other circumstances, I have a lot less time to put into one of my favorite hobbies. That being said, this map has been in the works for several months, plagued by lighting bugs and errors caused by the source engine rather than it being my fault.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this, unlike my last release, focuses much more on just having some good old fun. This map features a rather dark and gloomy environment, but it can be changed rather quickly with a well placed shot. Several parts of the village can be set ablaze, illuminating the surrounding area. Features a 3d skybox, some nicely placed fog, precipitation, and thanks to some fancy new Source Engine features, an excellent amount of optimization. That being said, there is quite a lot of physics objects and fire entities in the map, making this a rather demanding map to run for people with low-level rigs. Have fun and enjoy :)\r\n\r\nOh, be careful when crossing the river. :3\r\n\r\n<center>**Statistics:**</center>\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Solids:** 1064\r\n**Faces:** 6941\r\n**Point Entities:** 305 \r\n**Solid Entities:** 255 \r\n**Unique Textures:** 34 \r\n**Texture Memory:** 17.73MB \r\n**Displacements:** 123 \r\n**Direct Lights:** 11 \r\n**Cubemaps:** 88\r\n\r\n**Work Time:** Worked on and off for months, Actual Work Time probably sits at around 8-9 Hours. \r\n**Final Compile Time: **4 Minutes \r\n**Nav Generation Time:** 32 Seconds + Custom Editing\r\n**Cubemap Compilation Time:** 7 Seconds"
