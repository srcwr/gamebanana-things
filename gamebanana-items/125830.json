	"_sText": "Hi, this is my 5th map in the colorglow series, this time its redglow, like always its possible on both scroll and auto, and probably all other styles as well. This one features some different platforms and i also tried not adding too many shortcuts in this one (i think blueglows shortcuts made it possible to skip too much of the map), i went with one near the end that would allow more advanced players to save a jump or two but other than that its pretty much straight forward. The map is a quite small but offers some height variation and hopefully some interesting gameplay, when i started making the map i basically just placed a huge square and started working around it to make the map.&nbsp;<br><br>Can admit i havent put a ton of work into this since i was just bored one day and mapped for 4-5 hours and pretty much made the entire thing, after that i let some people playtest it and made some changes based on the feedback i got from testing it for 3 days.<br><br>CSGO Version: <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/197443\">bhop_redglow_csgo</a><br><br>Map is around 40 seconds fully routed. Hope ya all enjoy it n have fun hoppin' :3"
