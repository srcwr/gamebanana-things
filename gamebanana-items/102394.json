A hastily assembled Counter-Terrorism unit has been dispatched to the scene.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Eliminate all opposition and plant the C4 explosives at the foodcourt's center.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: Prevent the Terrorists from succesfully detonating their package.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis will be my first map completed to a great enough degree that I feel it release worthy. As such I've taken my time to make sure it has a touch of polish before I kicked it out the door. Map includes custom textures as well as the overview and radar maps. The bot nav-file was not tuned but appears to be balanced after some observation.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I missed something or screwed up somewhere.\r\nComments, suggestions for improvement or flames (if you feel it necessary) are all welcome at my email."
