	"_sText": "The setting of this map is a Rocket Silo as well as some attached underground areas. Aside from the rocket silo you will also find the corresponding command center as well as a helicopter landing platform.\r\nThe starting point for the CTs is placed right next to this landing platform while the Hostage Area as well as the Ts' starting point is located inside of the facility.\r\nThe hostages have to be led outside either towards the blue trailer next to landing spot or towards the rocket silo itself.\r\nBecause the map was design for LAN-Partys with at least 20 Players, I put in several ways to save the hostages to give it a more tactical approach than many other CS Maps.\r\nDue to the fact that I put quite some effort into the visual appeal of the map, it should ideally be run on a computer with at least a Dual Core CPU and something equal or greater to a Geforce 8600.\r\n\r\nNow, just go and have fun with it.\r\n\r\n[KA]mOdIV\r\n\r\nChanges in this version:\r\n-ep2 content removed\r\n-> different textures and models\r\n-area around rocket silo is more detailed\r\n-smaller file size (about 50% reduced)\r\n-ct-spawn works now (so full 32 players is possible)"
