	"_sText": "Welcome to my first ever map! \r\n\r\nThis map consists of 3 areas that divide the spawn points for you and your team mates to dish it out, old school style. I did my best with the structure and have included a reasonable attempt at lighting.\r\n\r\nI did used 3kliksphilip's tutorials and he was a very credible teacher. There is one displacement usage in the map and it may look a bit ugly because I wanted it to be realistic and hide the *other* parts of the map. There is a player clip to prevent further complications such as falling off.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE* 2011 18th of May\r\n\r\nDue to a lack of training and usage of tutorials to create this map properly, there is a few glitches such as the missing textures. The map remains here because it is my first reasonable attempt at mapping. I am continuously trying to improve my structure, quality and positioning of player entities in my maps. \r\n\r\nI will continue to contribute with better quality contents that will definitely surpass the ludicrous excuse for a map."
