	"_sText": "This choppah was made by djflyer. You can find the original download link on this german site:\r\nhttp://www.mapping-tutorials.de/forum/showthread.php?t=5697\r\nIt´s a tutorial about how to make such flyable choppahs. (in german)\r\nWhen i return i´m going to make a english tutorial about it. (if i find some time)\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\r\nChanges:\r\nI parented the buttons on the choppah.\r\nAdded a trigger hurt.\r\nChanged the name of the entities. (so everyone can understand it)\r\nAdded a nice effect that has nothing to do with the choppah.^^\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\r\nI can´t edit/change the choppah atm because i removed steam from my pc. A friend of mine tested the prefab today and it worked fine for him.\r\nSo have fun and don´t forget to credit djflyer! =]\r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\nControl:\r\nDon´t use the left mouse button to get up, use the buttons for that.\r\nI guess you will understand how the choppah works after some practice.^^\r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\nP.S. I´m away for 2-4 weeks if there is any problem please pm me or drop a message on my profile before you take any actions. Thanks for your time."
