I tried to do it as soon as possible because I may have to offline for months (my learning schedule is full! :(( )\r\nThis maps is quite large that made me tired doing the whole thing. However, I think It's good to be a fight yard. But I did not add any weapons or buyzones into it. You may need DM to have good day with it.\r\nAnd It's original. You will need to builcubemaps before playing to get correct cubemaps. Having trouble with 3D Skybox so I copy and tag Valve for 3D Skybox. Of course, I have done some parts, not copy all :p!!\r\nI also do the radar and overview. But as I said, too tired, so nav is still empty. Be patient to build nav file for your own (doesn't require :)\r\nThanks TopHATTwaffle for his great tutorials.\r\n\r\nNow, enjoy, comment and vote for me :D\r\n----------\r\n\r\nPaiN"
