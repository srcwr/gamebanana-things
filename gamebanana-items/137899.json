The _fix version is for KSF only and does not include a number of details, including a bonus. Use this Gamebanana version if you wish to play the map to the fullest outside of KSF (ie, on Momentum Mod).**<br><br><br>My second full release project for surf. Development for this map started&nbsp;a bit after intra, so about a month and change from start to finish. The surf style is less polarising than intra, so more people should be able to enjoy it. After some pressure from granis, the map also has some bonuses, one courtesy of Spy Complex who came up with something under very short notice :) Big thanks to hesuka, warbag and draph for their roles in making the showcase for the map happen.<br><br>Map is about tier 3 staged, maxvel 3500"
