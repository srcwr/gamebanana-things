Here the original game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/203730/\r\n\r\nFeatures of the map:\r\n\r\n• 9 stages  \r\n• Q.U.B.E. design  \r\n• Custom radar  \r\n• Anti-Scout  \r\n• Strafe Longjumps up to 250 units  \r\n• Time controlled stages  \r\n• Boosters  \r\n\r\nAll blocks are individual. Textures are all selfmade or made by valve.\r\n\r\nHave fun with this little xc map :)\r\n\r\nDotty"
