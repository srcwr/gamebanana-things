	"_sText": "Another Simple map. This map was not based on how cool the textures are, It was based on the gameplay style and how much fun players would have on it.\r\n\r\nDescription: Basicly Objective is to Eliminate the enemy. You need to break the glass in the center then shoot your enemy. There are 2 towers with 2 AWPs on each. Those Towers are used for snipeing. There are also 4 platforms on the 4 corners of the map and those can be used for snipeing or just having a great camping time. Thats basicly it. Enjoy!!\r\n\r\nNote 1: Sorry for only 1 screenshot. I couldn't find better spots on the map to take screens.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Ladders are there to get on the towers and platforms.\r\n\r\nNote 3: If you would like to use bots on this map and don't know how read my Tutorial on \"How to make bots work on custom maps\"\r\n\r\nNote 4: There WILL be a Version 2 to this map where i will be adding things and making the map look better.\r\n\r\nHope you like the map."
