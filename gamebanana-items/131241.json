All Made by me. \r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#FA950C\">zm_alca-laboratorium\r\n</font>This map provides less Public Hidespots. In my map, you have to think twice, before camping in a spot. :P Even here, without teamplay you die soon. ;) \r\n\r\nThe Map contains lots of custom textures (as you can see on the screenshots). Thats by the way why the map size is bigger than thougth by me.. ;)\r\n\r\nYou have some Places to camp well, not so much place to run, less place to hide instant, if you respawn as Human without ZM-Prtect on the server you will get infected fast, because there are only small ways.. Indeed that is the purpose of it.. ;) I think as zombie you don't have as much stress as humans. ;) They got a huge metal-shell-kick-ass party with their guns. ;D\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#FA950C\">Mappers Mind</font>\r\nI tried to make the map good for lots of players, so it will make more fun.. there are about 70 Spawnplaces, but i'm not sure.. don't want to count them all. ;) \r\n\r\n<font color=\"#FA950C\">Next Version</font>\r\nThe next version will contain 2 Hidespots more than this version and is still in construction. Look forward to a ULTRA-EXTREM-ASS-KICK-Campspot. :P Even to make the map looks smaller, as it is. ;) \r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<hr />Thx to: My <b>Girlfriend</b>, even if she treated me for mapping all the day..., <b>Crox</b> for uploading (i hate 6k DSL), <b>Serval ZM-Servers</b> and you for reading this shit ;)\r\n<hr  />For any requests about the map, contact me in ICQ <font color=\"#FA950C\"><b>708554</b></font>\r\n</center>\r\n"
