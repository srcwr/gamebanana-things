The logic_case compares the number input from the math_counter to the cases it has, and fires the first case that matches. Depending on which case is fired, it enables or disables each func_brush to show the number. When a counter hits its max it adds 1 to the next counter, which controls another  digit.\r\n\r\nFibbs Timer/Counter maximum value was 99.\r\nmy Timer/Counter goes to 59 and after the next second adds a minute: \r\nFibbs Timer: 59 to 60 ... 99 to 00\r\nMy Timer: 0:59 to 1:00 ... 9:59 to 0:00\r\n\r\nthe improved counter/timer works until it reaches 9 minutes and 59 seconds while fibbs counter works until it reaches 99 seconds.\r\n\r\nTheres a Start, Stop and Reset Button.\r\n\r\n_______________\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease credit Fibbs and me if you use this in your map!\r\n\r\n"
