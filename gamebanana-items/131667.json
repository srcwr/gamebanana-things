It's quite old though so I took the time to spice it up a little bit with a couple more camping spots and some revisions on older ones.  All in all it should be fun to play.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Radar Map\r\n- 64 Spawns\r\n\r\nThe original version is called zm_deep_thought_remix and was made by archangel_505 some time ago.  This is the second time I've released a map that had input from both of us in it.  If you have questions or comments let me know.</font>"
