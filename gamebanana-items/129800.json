	"_sText": "You can raise and lower the cell block, as well as rotate it. You can also raise and lower the cage part, giving you a big cage when the cells are down. There is a hidden gun in a cell, in the dining hall's pot, in the kitchen when you shoot the health sign from behind the counter, and one in the library via an invisible platform on the second story wall above the door. There's a one-shot teleport to armory when a small button above the fireplace is pressed. Contains the standard stuff: Medic, Pool, a very small soccer area, etc.. No disco, because fancy people don't have parties. All custom textures should be packed into the map."
