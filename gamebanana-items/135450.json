	"_sText": "This map was created to be a small fast map that was to be even and could support up to 24 players(12 per team). It has a couple problems such as, it has given me a few fps problems because of all the props but thats mostly my personal graphics problem. The only other problem I know of at the moment is with the bots. When the round starts, they tend to shoot the canopy above spawn which breaks and ruins the point of having it there(which the point is to be able to get on it and shoot from there). But other then that I hope you enjoy the map! Please post feedback and rate the map to help me out in the future. :) Enjoy!"
