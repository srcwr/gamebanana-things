I ask grey echo if I could remake the map and this is what I came up with\r\n\r\nzm_breakable_teeter_totter_b1\r\nThis map is based off of a popular glass map called break floor but it has been redesigned textured and optimized for zombie mod on top of that I added a swinging teeter totter on the very top of a tower zombie must first break the lower supports to allow the players to sway out of control. Making it easier for zombie to kill someone. The first few minutes of the round are crucial and will decide the faith of the humans.  If there are to many people on one side of the tower floor the himian will crash down to there deaths \r\n\r\nI will figure out how to make a demo of this \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nMap specs\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n-Stylish De_dust theme.\r\n- teleport at the bottom of the pit so users are returned to the top if they fall\r\n- Maximum optimization for the least amount of FPS loss and lag possible.\r\n-Real time lighting \r\n-3d skybox\r\n-32spawn points\r\n-Custom phys override (will fix lag issues and stop glitches on the map)\r\n-Cool teeter Totter \r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nupdates\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n-Fixed  Teleport\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nCrazy[Virus] added teeter totter physics skybox and optimized\r\nGrey-Echo textured and made the map work andlook sexy \r\n \r\nwww.ech0-gaming.com\r\nwww.undead-mafia.com\r\n\r\nNote this is a beta and it has moving objects there may be bugs/lag let me know if you find any "
