It actually, despite the size, helped me discover a few new things about mapping, such as the blocklight tool and the invisible metal tool. But anyway, without further adieu, here it is!\r\n\r\n__________| gg_wall |__________\r\n\r\nThis chaotic little map is a fragfest beyond fragfests! Try to stay alive when the enemy is literally in your spawn within the first few seconds of the map! Impossible to hide in, the map provides no cover whatsoever, so stay on your feet and keep the mouse turning! Game rounds last seconds, and a grenade warmup round is a must have. \r\n\r\nHappy Fraggin!\r\n\r\nThank you to all &#9674;FS&#9674; Members who have all supported me and my map making ever since I joined!"
