	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map DE_VAST<br><br>Nav Creator: Meurglis3, Release Date: December 29 2013<br><br>Here is the Navigation Mesh for old amusing industrial-themed map <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/7511\">de_vast</a> by DarkMortar (released August 2005). It's a fully hand-tuned .nav-file (because original author's .nav-file was simply auto-gen and in it there were many bugs).<br><br>Nearly a half of this Navigation Mesh was remade manually and bots freely and surely move on all space of the map now. I hope that they won't allow you to miss! :D<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/7511\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Fun! All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: DarkMortar (for his diligence to make the fun and fast-paced map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Happy Frags in Happy New Year! :-)<br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br><br><b>UPDATED 10.12.2014</b><br><br>General Fixes:\r\n<br>- Added Place Names;\r\n<br>- Some other minor changes.<br><br><b>PLEASE REDOWNLOAD UPDATED ARCHIVE!</b>"
