I thought that having a map full of the rarely used Machine Gun (M249) and some grenades would be nice to play on.\r\nIt's my 1st map ever, so please don't rate it too bad, as I'm not yet an experienced mapper.\r\nAny sugestions, comments or ideas will be read and considered in the making of a possible 2nd version.\r\nThank you for reading and, please, enjoy! ^.^\r\n\r\nThank you ValVe!"
