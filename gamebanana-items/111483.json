	"_sText": "This map is one where you spawn, press the blue button, wait 10 secs, then the door opens, making both teams in view, so be sure to hide behind one of the many obstacles! Then this is where the killing starts! =) The door closes after 15 secs, giving time to reload and find a new hiding place, then opens again 5 secs later, then closes after another 15 secs. The button must be pressed again to open it again after 2 opens.\r\n\r\nThere is a hidden platform in both spawns and a hidden button in both spawns which can enable a huge bomb to go off. If you hear: \"The bomb has been planted!\" then you know someone has started the timer for 60 secs. Just before the 60 secs are up, you will hear: \"Get out of there, it's gonna blow!\" then after the 60 secs... *BOOM* (You wont need any extra sounds to download for this to work, just the map.)\r\n\r\n**NOTE: THIS MAP IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH PLUGINS WHICH GIVE WEAPONS AND/OR ALLOW RESPAWNING. FOR MOST ENJOYMENT, USE ON A NORMAL SERVER. BOTS DO NOT BEHAVE VERY WELL AND THEY CAN CAUSE MAJOR FPS LAG; THEY ARE NOT RECOMMENDED.**\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that there is at least 6 people per team on this map for maximum enjoyment."
