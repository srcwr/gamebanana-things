The\r\nlighting has been improved, unfortuantly i cant get the area bright enough, so the\r\ntime set of the battle is a dusk-like time though the bunkers are lit. The awps and scouts \r\nare now both acessable from the beginning instead of searching for the scouts,\r\ni have also added bunker-busting equipment on a table in the back of the spawn room.\r\nThe .nav mesh as be edited so that bots are forced near the weapons closet and therefore\r\nuse more than a pistol. Bots do not leave the bunkers, i cannot get them to go up a\r\nladder and there is no mesh on the ramp leading off of the bunkers."
