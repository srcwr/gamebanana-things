	"_sText": "Changes from version de_canyonbeta:\r\n\r\n1: Limited walkable space\r\n2: covered middle dam and changed natural rock formation bridge into a wooden covered bridge.\r\n3: Added sand to impressions and flat areas  in the rocks above the valley floor.\r\n4: Added extra route from middle dam to CT spawn/ A site. Now the ladder up to B isn't the only choice you have here. \r\n5: Raised the roof of the complex for more head space and tweaked rock formations for better/ longer cover and to tweak the timed meeting points or rush points making them slightly better.\r\n6: Have played with Bots and seemed pretty sweet to me  \r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy- and if you Add this map to your servers rotation or voting system let me know I'd love to play it :)"
