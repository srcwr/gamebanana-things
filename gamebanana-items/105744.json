It is the same map but a little larger in length for a better gameplay. - http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/62071\r\n\r\nHey, this is Kersh, I'm pretty new to mapping and this is my 3rd or 4th map. However, this is my first submission.\r\n\r\nNot much to say but this is a pretty small map. It's an aim_ag map but it's recommended for GG. This is the final build of this map (I've done some testing with friends and bots) but I may add more onto it if people like it in a v2 of the map.\r\n\r\nAnyways thanks for checking out my map and please leave any constructive criticism in the comments. :)"
