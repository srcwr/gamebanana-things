	"_sText": "-BACKGROUND-\r\nA group of Counter-Terrorists were sent out to a junkyard in the middle east that had been reporting suspicious behavior for the past couple weeks. Having trouble navigating the terrain, their APCs crashed just outside the scrapyard. Upon arrival, they find it deserted. As the CTs are about to call for a chopper, gunshots are heard from over the ridge. The CTs take shelter in the nearby shed and prepare to meet the incoming Terrorist force head on.\r\n\r\n-MAP INFORMATION-\r\nThe Terrorist spawn is behind three containers outside the junkyard. There are lights that sort of map out a path to the junkyard entrance. Near the crashed APCs (mentioned above) there are M4a1s and USPs. The CTs will spawn in one of the two buildings inside the scrapyard (there are FAMASes and Five-Sevens on the tables). The two bombsites are the center of the junked cars, and the crane outside the junk area. Many props provide cover, and the bots WILL use it.\r\n\r\nWORKS IN GMOD AS WELL!"
