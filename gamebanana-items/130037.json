Be careful with turbo though because you might flip your buggy going over the bumps in this map.\r\n\r\nAs with all rally race maps this can not be used to play regular CS:S -- there are no bomb sites or hostages.  This map is only for use with a Rally Race server.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments?  Feel free to talk to PM me or leave them here.</color>"
