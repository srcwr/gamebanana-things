It is much easier than my other maps. For the first time in my mapmaking \"career\" I've also made a map with stages. There are 6 stages in total of varying difficulty.&nbsp;<br><br>WARNING: The stages are absolutely NOT straightforward. Don't worry if you get lost at some point.&nbsp;<br><br>Length: 40 seconds to 1 minute<br>Difficulty: Easy - Medium<br><br><hr><br>HUGE thanks to GAMMACASE for helping me out with the glowing neon textures. Without him/her I would've never figured it out and the textures would look a LOT worse."
