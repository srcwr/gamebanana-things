	"_sText": "First time creating a map. This is a Gun Game map (could be used for a variety of other game modes though), with red side being the CT spawn, and Green being the Terrorist spawn. Staircase room on one side of the map, with the library on the opposite side. Great Hall in the middle of the map.\r\n\r\nWould like to thank TopHATTwaffle for creating the amazing textures you see in the spawn rooms."
