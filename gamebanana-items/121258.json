	"_sText": "The original author of this map was simiancage.\r\n\r\nAll I did to this was add a crosshair for the scout. It's a env_screenoverlay, so the map doesn't mess with serversettings or anything like that.  You can see how it looks in the screenshots. I couldn't use color, because that made it glitchy for some reason.\r\n\r\nI did a few optimizations, replaced the missing texures and deleted some pointless entities, but otherwise the map is completely untouched.
