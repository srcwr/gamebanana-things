	"_sText": "Zm_skydrop_v2 is map following the same theme as hosties_skyglass. This map features a skybase and a rocky environment connected by an extremely long elevator. Both the skybase and \"planet\" have places to hide, places to barricade, key points defend and running areas for a real challenge. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTICE THESE CAPITAL LETTERS SO THAT YOU KNOW IN THE SPAWN AREA, THERE ARE 6 WAYS TO GET UP TO THE BALCONIES TO DROP DOWN INTO THE MAIN PLAY AREAS:\r\n\r\nTHE 2 ROPE LADDERS ET OPPOSITE EACH OTHER AND THE 4 CORNERS OF THE SPAWN AREA, THE FENCES ARE CLIMBABLE.\r\n\r\nI spent about 2 weeks creating this map. Please leave constructive criticisms and such, thanks to Phraggah and ZaLoS for help with tracktrains and server commands. Thanks to ZMan, Juan(mexican?) and Phraggah for helping to test.\r\n\r\nHere is a hint for gaining access to the secret area, \"when you cook, you usually warm up the stove and then get your ingredients.\"\r\n\r\nPlease have fun and enjoy.\r\n\r\nOh and there was only a v1 during testing, so don't go searching for a v1, you won't find one.\r\n\r\nUPDATE TO v3, REDUCED COUCHES IN EARTH BUNKER, VAULT DOORS ARE NOW USABLE MORE THAN ONCE, COUCHES IN BUNKER ARE NOW CONSTRICTED TO THEIR STARTING ROOMS TO REDUCE ELEVATOR CLUTTER.\r\n\r\nThis map sponsored by intox Gaming, please visit us at www.intoxgaming.com"
