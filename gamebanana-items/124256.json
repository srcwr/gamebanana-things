But the Terrorists don't give their stolen money back, and they don't wan't to go to prison. They take their weapons, and the battle begins.\r\n\r\nThat is the story of my new little map. You just have to kill the opponent with your Shotgun or Deagle. There is alot of things that helps you hiding. But watch out. The makes it impossible to look everywhere in the map. But i have to say that, i didn't really know what my map should contain, so, i've just putted in alot of boxes and so on.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy my map ;)"
