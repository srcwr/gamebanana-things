I made it specifically for a couple friends of mine. A few custom textures which are included in the BSP. Hope you all have fun playing the map! (If you are going to put this in your servers map list, please drop me a line here on FPSB or email me at sKRewind(at)yahoo(dot)com, I'd love to come get some feedback from you and your server's regulars."
