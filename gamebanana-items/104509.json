I had to learn how to use Hammer back then, so the map is a bit crude.\r\n\r\nUnknown - Bomb Defuse\r\n\r\nby Soctom\t\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorists: Protect the abandoned\r\nmilitary base from a terrorist attack.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: Blow up the abandoned military\r\nbase to release deadly nerve gas.\r\n\r\nMap Notes: This map was supposed to be\r\nreleased back in 2004 for a server with 64\r\nplayer slots. I've redone a few things to make\r\nthe game play more fun, also the map only has\r\n32 player spawns now. This map was made in a\r\nweek back in 2004 and fixed up in 2 days in 2007.\r\nThe map was never released in 2004 because no one\r\nplayed on the guys 64 player server so he shut it down,\r\nand I never released it until now.\r\n\r\n(Press FIRE to continue)"
