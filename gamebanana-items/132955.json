Write here all bugs you found in my map.\r\nMap is very small, there only are a few camping spots. I warned you, so dont whine.\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\n\r\nSurvivors broke in the old abandoned facility in search of shelter but zombie madness aleady was there and infection starts it's bloody journey from dead to living.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nGameplay includes some unique things like healing machine and fire that can ignite player. Use them wisely! I tried to do no spots with one way in.\r\n\r\nExtra area: It is very secret, most clever will find tips.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\nActually it is my first serious project/release for CS:S so be nice.\r\nAll found bugs you can post here.\r\nI think i paked all textures in bsp. if you got any textures missed post here.\r\nI would to thank S-LoW for nice alien skin"
