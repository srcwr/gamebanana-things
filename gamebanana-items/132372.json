	"_sText": "First thing's first...TURN OFF ZOMBIE FOG WHEN PLAYING THIS MAP! honestly it takes away from the mood of the map and makes it look a lot uglier.\r\n\r\nAll the info's in the read me document packaged with the rar.\r\n\r\nGOOD NEWS! THE MAP IS FINALLY OPTIMIZED! I figured out how to fix my map thanks to more research...\r\n\r\nThis map supports up to 56 players. I recommend playing this version on smaller servers since it's only a 1 story elementary school at the moment. Now that this is optimized I can concentrate on making a zm_midwich_2f!\r\n\r\nRemember...lots of secrets/hidden doors. There's only ONE room that I know of where there isn't a 2nd way to get inside. Scratch and claw your way around walls, floors, etc. to see if you can break into rooms to attack humans.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map. ;) Thanks for all the wonderful comments on my first iteration of the map!\r\n\r\nP.S. I've added one more camp spot for the humans. You should be able to notice if you've played my first version of the map."
