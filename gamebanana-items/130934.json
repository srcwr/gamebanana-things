I loved the screaming in the end though, epic victory roar! :P</p>\r\n<p>2# Sg's second win was much better than the first one.\r\none zombie untill the spaceship, fewer zombies at the end. I liked the alien device\r\ntiming and the bossfight itself (some died but they managed to make it anyways). The alien timing was perfect. \r\nI laughed at the human who died by the alien, im such a bad person. this was SG's best win.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>SyndicateGamers</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1# I really liked sG's win. They had a decent amount of zombies from the beginning untill ZaN killed them all \r\nexcept 1 with the gauss rifle xD. The zombie defense seemed really easy during the bossfight. Im impressed that\r\nthey managed to kill the predator even though so many died during the fight. The alien device timing was really \r\ngood also. They few humans left held back the zombie from getting killed by the alien. They also managed to kill\r\nthe alien just in time (like SG's second win). The victory screaming was once again awesome.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>Zmcorp (WINNER)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1# I didn't like the first win at all, The alien should have killed the humans but it pushed them \r\ninside the wall instead. (same scenario as SG's first win) Also for some reason the recorder recorded a failround\r\nin the same demofile.</p>\r\n<p>2# (WINNING DEMO) This was a really good win actually. They had the most amount of zombies at the end and still won, they even \r\nmanaged to beat the predator without any alien device. Well they used the \"corner technique\". Alien timing\r\nwas really good, just like the others. This was their best win of all 4.</p>\r\n<p>3# This demo started right before the final bossevent (climbing towards the core). same amount of zombies as the \r\nsecond demo. The alien got even closer this time, due to the demo starting in the middle of the fight i cant judge\r\non much. This demo wont pass.</p>\r\n<p>4# I didn't like this win either, first of all they recorded 2 rounds again. Secondly most zombies didn't do anything\r\nduring the bossfight. About 70% of the zombies started to move once the zombie bridge activated. The alien lagged\r\n(same scenario as SG's first win) as they should have died.\r\nI wouldn't say that this demo have a bigger chance of winning at all. The 2nd one remains the best win for Zm Corp.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>Bor3dgaming</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1# bG's win was really good. Fair amount of humans/zombies. Good alien device timing, alien got killed fast and the\r\nteamspeak was great. There was slightly few zombies at the end though, most of them seemed to be far in the back.\r\nThe overall round was pretty decent, i approve.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>These are fast summaries of each demo, there is smaller detail that i haven't explained above.\r\nPlease accept the fact that you didn't win/get your name implemented in case you didn't.\r\nThe winning community may design their own \"plate\" for me to put in the map.\r\nI will put the playernames of the winning community in the map + a list of the communities who tried.\r\nI hope you all had a fun experience while playing. I dont think that i will make a challenge\r\nagain, but we cant know for sure.</p>\r\n<p>See you ingame!\r\n/Luffaren</p>\r\n<p><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em><em>*</em><em>_</em>_*</p>"
