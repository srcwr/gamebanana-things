As you go further out from your base, you will be able to get better weapons.\r\n34 Spawnpoints (recommended 20 players max.)\r\nThis is the first version. There may be places that needs improvement. You can send suggestions/comments to cs_akman@yahoo.com.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: 34 Players in this map might be too much. About 20 would be nice.\r\nGood tactics will help in this map."
