From ceilings long tongues of Barnacles hang down. Zombie attacks the player ...\r\n\r\nA little mistakes and bugs are corrected. Productivity, especially on bombplace B is raised.\r\n\r\nIllumination on a map is made more natural.  Skybox is made more detailed.\r\n\r\nTo contact a smooth map, as in cs1.6. All details are made by illusion or smoothed by clips.\r\n\r\nOverview and nav-Files are attached inside the map. (nav by Chizbone)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHX TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHORs OF DE_PIRANESI."
