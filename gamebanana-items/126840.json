	"_sText": "This map was started creation on June 28th 2009 when William 'Billy' D. Mays died. This map is a tribute towards him and his legacy. The products or names of products used in this map do NOT belong to me.\r\n\r\nAt the end, I added 2 different ending, Bhop and Scouts. I think that they will please more people than just 1 ending. Also, once one person goes through and ending, the other portals are disable so you can only go through one. I think this is a huge improvement from b1, and more people will enjoy it.\r\n\r\nV5 Update:\r\nExtended map, double amount of traps, added or secrets, changed secrets.\r\n"
