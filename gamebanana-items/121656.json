	"_sText": "This map is an indoor warehouse style map.  I've included a radar overlay, probably the first one in a surf map.  The map has a bombsite and buyzone, located at the center of the map, near the rafters.  The map is decomplie protected.  If you have any questions, xfire me at spetfield or email me at petfield@gmail.com.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\nNOTE: All pushes are surfable both ways! They are a little buggy, but it's impossible for me to fix.  Just make sure you're going at a decent speed when hitting them, and try not to hit a push the same time as someone else.\r\n\r\nMap made by [UDel] Steve with help from X-Shark.\r\nRelease by SolidSurf http://www.solidsurf.info\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to beta testers:\r\nBuck Nasty\r\nFaj\r\nGaiy Psycho\r\nArchAngel\r\nWasp\r\nPlatinum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpawn points: 36"
