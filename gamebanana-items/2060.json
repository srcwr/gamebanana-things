It's 68x68, but you know, you can make it fit your 64x64 grid no problem if you are worried about that. \r\nMade this for my map <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/163037\">dm seine crossing</a> which was modeled after the Seine Crossing map in Battlefield 3. \r\nIt is pretty heavy on brush faces so I wouldn't spam them all over your map if you're making a larger one that may be hitting the brush limit.\r\nIf you use this please make sure to credit me for it. Thank you."
