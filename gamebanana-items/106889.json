You spawn with a deagle, duh... it is called potty because it looks like a bathroom.\r\n\r\nMy friend clips gave me ideas and watched me speedmap this in exactly 45 minutes, including lighting, optimization, and pwnage. It was fun to make, and enjoy!\r\n\r\nSincerely, [F]ox.\r\n\r\n(ps i will *cum* out with a gg version so don't ask >:D)"
