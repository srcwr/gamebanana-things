	"_sText": "Defuse map at a chemical plant.\r\n\r\nThis is a testing first release with plans to add a custom bot nav if I can talk my friend into it but not until I finish the map up with better detail for the ground with some elevation differences and a 3d skybox.  Also may do some gameplay changes if I get good sounding suggestions/requests... thats the main reason I'm releasing it now.... I want the feedback and suggestions.\r\n\r\nGameplay style is like de_port as it has an open feel to it BUT there is much more to it... and bombsites are closer together ;)\r\n\r\nPlenty of camping spots but all of them have weaknesses.  Good teamwork should own on this map.\r\n\r\n"
