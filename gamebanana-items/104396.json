	"_sText": "This is a map set in a trainstation (A DER). I did what I did in my other Half-Life 2 Deathmatch map. There is a train that goes by and the players must watch out for it. The two bombsites are a garden and the docks. I thought about the layout alot when I was making this map. I literally worked on this map ANY chance I got. A week and a half of constant mapping. \r\n\r\nCOOL POINTS OF THE MAP: \r\n-The train \r\n-MAKE SURE TO GET HIT BY THE TRAIN! It honks it horn when it hits a player and the player goes FLYING. \r\n-The docks explode when the bomb explodes \r\n-The garden fountain explodes when the bomb explodes. \r\n-REALLY fun to play with bots or people. Nothing cooler than hearing the train horn in the distance and then looking up to see who got smaked by it. (Especially with bots :D) \r\n-Bots play well in it"
