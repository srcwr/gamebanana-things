	"_sText": "This is a remake of the very first map I created call Aim_Huge_Sniper ( Last screenshot is my old map ) I retextured it, fixed the teleport, added several details, added lighting, well it's pretty much a whole different map now. Theres 2 teleport points in the map each going to different locations at the top of the map for a good sniping point. I used the ring teleporter prefab by jking and a teleporter of my own. Enjoy and a special thanks to the creator of the ring teleporter, JKing."
