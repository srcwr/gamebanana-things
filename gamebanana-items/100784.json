I am aware that you are able to sniper from across the map, I plan on fixing that later.\r\n\r\nThere is also a secret room I call, The Crib. There is nothing in it but a teleporter exit that takes you onto the rocks, and some Pokemon.\r\n\r\nI would love feedback on the map about what you think about it, and what you think I should change. Have fun!"
