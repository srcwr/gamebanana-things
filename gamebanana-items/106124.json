Has 2 bunker\\hideouts in the middle for each team you can get on top of them go in them or go under them.  The map can still work if you restrict AWPs\\autos on your server.   The map shouldn't be used if bots are going to be used on the server.  They don't know how to get out of spawn even though it's easy for a human."
