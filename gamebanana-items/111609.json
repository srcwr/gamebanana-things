	"_sText": "Welcome to Fy_Buckshot_Breakfloor!\r\n\r\nThis map is all in the name.  Its a bit of a fight arena/shotty map, and a bit of breakfloor all mixed in one.  \r\n\r\nThis was a quick build because I was bored, and I wanted to make a fun map that all could enjoy.  It is quite addicting, well, at least to me it is!\r\n\r\nStart:\r\nM3 Shotgun\r\nGrenade\r\nDeagle\r\n(All are fully loaded to begin with)\r\n\r\nThere is HDR in this map, it is slighty hard to notice, but hey, I don't like overdoing things anyway.  It adds a nice touch.\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy!"
