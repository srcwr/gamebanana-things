	"_sText": "An aim map with twin destructible forts facing one another across a stretch of rolling snowy banks. This map has gone through play-testing for balance changes and supports up to 10players.\r\n\r\nOriginally the walls were two layers thick throughout the forts and the ceiling was collapsible into planks. However, by sacrificing these features the map is now playable with improved fps. Newer computers will perform better."
