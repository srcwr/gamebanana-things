	"_sText": "<b>Greyfrog Design Presents</b><br><br>This is a beta release, I wanted to give this to the community to help me trouble shoot this release. If all goes well after this beta a final will be given.<br><br>this map includes many light effects, ambient noises, breakable objects, props placed in a way I'm sure you've never seen. and of course My ability to create displacements. The entire main construct of this map is a displacement. There are brush based architecture with in the displacement to give it a fuller area. the long halls are idea for snipers but the back door halls help the enemy to get a sneak attack on you if you stay to  long. \r\n\r\n<br>Id appreciate any and all comments, ratings, feedback on this beta. \r\n\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Manfly"
