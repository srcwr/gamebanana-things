	"_sText": "A small close quarters map set in a sewer. \r\nThe map plays RELATIVELY slow for how small it is, and spawn-killing shouldn't be a problem. \r\nHave no misconceptions though - it's made for action.\r\n\r\nDark, but not to the point where a flashlight should be used.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice the parts of the level with the most advantageous positions are the most well lit. This provides strategy-minded individuals with an important choice. Maintain a low profile or snipe from the higher ground?\r\n\r\nUp to 36 players max, but I'd recommend a much smaller number (12).\r\n\r\nHope ya'll enjoy it\r\n\r\n- Midas_Touch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
