FPSB is giving me some troubles uploading and editing my uploaded maps :(.</font>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><b>Update 1-5-09</b></legend>\r\nBug fix:\r\n - Fixed a bug that caused the damage field not to reset when the red button was pressed.\r\nExtra:\r\n - Added a new event.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend><b>Update 30-4-09</b></legend>\r\nBug fixes:\r\n - Fixed a bug that would cause the red buttons not to function when pressed to early\r\n - The wall in the middle will now disappear when 6 (instead of 10) rounds have been played.\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\n - Added some moving obstacles to the map.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\nIt goes like this:\r\n\r\nThere are 5 events that can randomly happen. Once the first event has ended, the next will start. This will keep happening. If the players can survive 6 events, the events will stop happening, the walls in the middle will disappear, and players will be able to pick up a deagle with 7 bullets or just go in with nothing but a knife.\r\n\r\nThe last team standing wins.\r\n\r\n<font color=\"red\">If you find any bugs, please let me know</font>"
