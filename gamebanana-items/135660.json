	"_sText": "Grua is spanish for crane.\r\n\r\nThis is a Gungame 4hm level. I made it small for close contact fighting (a quick game is a good game). I added a few camping and sniper spots for fair gameplay.\r\n\r\nCaution, you cannot go for a swim in my version of Sydney harbour, the water is deadly ;). \r\n\r\nThere is access onto the Tub Boats for all u campers but u can't hide on it. Be carefull not to fall into the water when you try to board them.\r\n\r\nI made some custom textures of the Sydney skyline and added harbour soundscape for atmosphere.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nMadNoob"
