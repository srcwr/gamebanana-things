	"_sText": "Hiya guys. Just put the finishing touches on. It's 2:41 EST and my eyes hurt. This glass map I made for everybody with extras for people like me. See, I suck at glass maps, but I like playing them and making them. But I never get a kill. So i never get enough to buy a weapon. So I have evenly placed weapons all over the map. Also, on glass maps, I don't like the ENTIRE WALLHACK feel, where you can see EVERY SINGLE THING. So I have added a few crates and barrels for cover. Bombsite is the middle plank on the walkway. Good luck getting there. Don't let the bomb fall to the spikes."
