	"_sText": "<p>4th and probably my final bhop map. Hammer is too much for my computer, and I was going to fix some minor things and when I compiled it kept loading the old version, and I cba to look into it. The map still works completely fine. Made for auto, Idk if you can do this on scroll but I wouldnt recommend it. It is pretty fun to route, and gets a little difficult to speedrun up top, but there are more than enough people who are good enough to optimize this map. Have fun, or don't.</p>"
