	"_sText": "This is a new type of maps that is: Terrorists are ninjas and ct's are the targets. CT's are not allowed to have any gun except USP and Terrorists are only allowed to use a knife, even tho they pick up a gun.  The ninjas are somewhere around them and the point of this is to assassinate the counter-terrorists.\r\nMax T  = 4\r\nMax CT = 16 \r\nThis map is still being designed and the floor has now been changed to concrete instead of just plain white. I intend to realease the final version after a few days and then all problems will be sorted.\r\n\r\nTo get the map into you map folder , u rename the file ti ninja_warehouse.bsp and put it in the C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\<account name>\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\n\r\n\r\nPs. People got used to jailbreak so this will be just the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are working on a Ninja-Mod and hopefully that will be online soon.\r\n\r\n                                           -Ethereal-Cookie-"
