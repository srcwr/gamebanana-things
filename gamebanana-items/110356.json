A good place to rumble,\r\nor even the propane stash, or perhaps the storage corner. \r\neither way its going to be good. \r\nthe lighting is fast and the fps \r\nare great, even in the fray.\r\n\r\n\r\nCons: \r\n\r\nbecause of the way the light \r\n\r\neffects were created it makes \r\n\r\nbot travel in the map impossible... \r\n\r\nsry no nav. file\r\n"
