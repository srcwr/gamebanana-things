	"_sText": "STILL FIRST MAP!\r\n\r\nDue to demand, I retextured everything, added lighting, more spawnpoints, a little more detail, and added ambient noise. I also fixed a few minor bugs. Do not download v1 unless you want dev textures, fullbright, and seizures.\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\nFence area, harder for zombies\r\nBunker area, harder for zombies\r\nPlatform area, harder for humans\r\nLadder area, harder for humans\r\nFixed a few cheap spots\r\n\r\nThis map requires a lot of teamwork. Otherwise, you will get owned. There is no barricading at all. You will either be on top of something, or behind an already made barricade. Also, I've prevented stacking of humans by lowering the ceiling."
