	"_sText": "<p>Hello,</p><p>Basicly, i just want to delete the spawn kill of this map and i don't like how is mapped :/ (Wall in wall, no decoration, leak etc ..) I know i'm not the \"better mapper\" but i think i make a good work. So, if it's possible, can you vote this map ? I want a good vision of what i make/ remake. This map is for the minigame server of the Noname Team (176.31.181.150:27145) which are configurate by me, Potatoze, and No'. For this map, i was based of the original map and i built the map from a dead point. I use exactly the same distance (Unit's) of the orignal map.&nbsp;</p><p>*** I turn the option of paint to \"func_detail\" for a test, but i forgot to turn in \"func_illusionary\" -&gt; Fixed. ***</p><p>If you have any questions or other ..
