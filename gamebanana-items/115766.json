So I did and I\r\nfigured I could upload it here for anyone who wishes to play some dodgeball\r\nin an indoor-style arena.\r\n\r\nMap layout is roughly based off of a basketball court / dodgeball court.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is meant for LEAGUE use... some people may use the stands as a way\r\nto avoid grenades. Since this is beta, I figured I'd let you decide if I should\r\nkeep them or not.\r\n\r\nThanks, and enjoy!\r\n-free"
