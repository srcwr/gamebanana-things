	"_sText": "Surf_badlands by [UDel]Steve\r\n\r\nThis is my first map release for CS:S.  This map should be played on 66 and 100 tick servers, some of the surf may not be possible on a 33 tick server. The map has some fairly challenging surf, and also a few secrets. The jail, weapon spawners, weapon rings, and teleporters were all made from scratch. If you're curious as to how I made them, or have any other questions, my email is petfield@gmail.com\r\n\r\nAlso, the map is decompile protected.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nr1 Update Fixes:\r\nMade it harder to shoot through glass at spawn\r\nAdded more surf\r\nChanged skybox texture to make ramps more visible\r\nChanged jail kill mechanisms a little bit, the boxes go under the floor now"
