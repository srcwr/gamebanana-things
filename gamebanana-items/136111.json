	"_sText": "[Video Tour of GG Pergola Final](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjexHcOvx0o \"Video Tour\")\r\n\r\nMap doubles as \"AIM\" type. Buyzones are included in the map.\r\n\r\nSmall to Medium sized map that is balanced on both teams. Three different buildings that are available to enter. As well as a large amount of elevation variation. \r\n\r\nThere are rope ladders on the roof of the outermost buildings leading to a balcony. While within buildings lie an underground maintenance access shaft. There is a peephole underneath to the other side. Good for \"undermining\" the opposing team.\r\n\r\nThere is a secret \"passage\" on either side of the map which can be entered by pressing a brick on the exterior walls of the outermost (enterable / playable) buildings. The passage does not break gameplay nor does it conflict with anything else in the map. Game play is solid, and quick, without it feeling like spawn rape as in \"fy_shotty\".\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to contact me for tips & tricks my steam username is damoose972. I'm usually under the alias of \"-mooSe'\" or \"moosegard\".\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing and please feel free to leave comments and criticism(s)."
