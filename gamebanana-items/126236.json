	"_sText": "A basic bhop training map.\r\nThe first \"easy\" sections do NOT go down, but if u try to bhop them as if they were then it poses a challenge as well as helping beginners.\r\n\r\nFor slighty better bhoppers there is an end section where they do go down and have harder jumps.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend this to any good bhopper but i think it is great for those wanting to practise and learn bhopping.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots are poor, but the sun and lighting gives a nice effect when actually on the map. Its set in early morning or twilight time.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know the scouts make you jump further!\r\nAt the end there is also trailed scouts so you know who reached the end!\r\n\r\nMost textures are dev/ ones, hence the name."
