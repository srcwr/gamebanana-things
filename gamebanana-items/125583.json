Map is intended for autobhop playstyle.<br>I kinda took on this map as a project to challenge myself to learn a bit more about Hammer while using good mapping practices. I also wanted to see if I still had what it takes to produce a decent quality map, as it's been a long while since my last update. A lot of effort went into this but I think it paid off in the end.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you enjoy it!"
