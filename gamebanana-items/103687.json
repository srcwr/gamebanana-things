Not only does it balance the teams extremely well with multiple vantage points and camping spots, it also demands ruthless team cooperation and planning in order for the round to be completed successfully.\r\n\r\n**Theme**\r\n\r\nde_relic is based in fictional ancient Egyptian pyramid grounds, just metres away from a growing modern city.  While working to uncover the secrets of this area, the excavation team was ambushed by extremists protesting the disturbance of historical grounds.  Due to the remoteness of the city, the local swat team has been called in to deal with the now world known terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe terrorists' plans to get back at the excavators is to - ironically - blow up a portion of the site, as an extreme way of sarcastically saying \"You wanted it, so we're doing it.\"\r\n\r\n<object width=\"500\" height=\"405\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/I5k8k_oc-TA&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/I5k8k_oc-TA&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"500\" height=\"405\"></embed></object>"
