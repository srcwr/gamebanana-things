	"_sText": "Spawns 32. 3 T's, 29 CT's. \r\nCT's start at spawn with knives and have to run to the \r\ntowers where the T's are, by hiding behind walls and \r\ndodging bullets from snipers. If you are lucky enough to make it \r\nacross, go into the teleport, knife a T, take the sniper, \r\nthen kill the other T's. Terrorists, try to stop the CT's \r\nfrom winning by sniping them before they make it across.\r\n\r\nEach T has a different gun. If you are facing the towers, the left tower has an awp, the middle has an auto sniper, and the right has a scout. In the CT spawn, you can risk spending time to go through a mini jump obsatcle to get a smoke grenade and a flashbang. Immediately outside the CT spawn, if you turn around and look a little up, there is another mini jump obstacle to complete to get a deagle. The catch is the T's can snipe you, so be careful!\r\n\r\nFun for 20-30 minutes. "
