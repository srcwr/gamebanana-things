If you request anything, I may or may not get to work on it, depending on how much time it would take/difficulty.\r\nWhat This Pack Contains:\r\n==================\r\nThis map pack contains two small maps, built for short and intense rounds.\r\n\r\nImportant Things\r\n===================================\r\n\r\n_**Please read the following:**_\r\n\r\nI give you permission to download these maps and use them on your server/suggest them to other servers without consulting me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not give you permission to re-upload, with or without altering, without consulting me first.\r\n\r\ncs_OrangeAlley has a 12 player max, **while cs_OrangeMetropolis has a 24 player max.**_\r\n\r\nBoth of these maps contain Bot Navigation Meshes I worked on, which allow the bots to know where they're going (usually) without jumping off an edge and falling to their death. \r\ncs_OrangeMetropolis gives a fun game when only knives are used.\r\n\r\n_**There are many more maps coming, and this is just a preview. Check out the HD remake of these maps at: http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/178506**_\r\n\r\n**Many thanks,\r\n(Lemon) WUNDerDUDe2312**"
