A birds-eye-view actually spelled out \"Mini Map\" at one stage of production, but I scrapped some of that because it wasn't working. Stairs and such are included. Big pipes are a feature of some rooms. The lighting isn't shitty, just an alternative to fullbright.\r\n\r\nThere is no outside to the map. Don't worry your pretty little heads about it.\r\n\r\nQuestions, comments, concerns? Tell me. Please assess.\r\n\r\nThanks."
