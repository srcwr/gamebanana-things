	"_sText": "A little about me. I'm apart of Clan AH; www.clanah.net, or jump in our server sometime if you can find it. I made this map because you don't see a lot of maze maps, and not a lot have some of the cool glitches I can make ;). I really worked hard on this map, its pretty basic but lots of fun when its just knives. This is my first map, so if somebody could help me with the installation and such, that would be great :D. This map is GREAT for suspense when it comes to the last person, or just a ton of people. This is also recommended for Deathmatch, because spawning and everything is fun and easy, with no chance of spawn killing. I'm sure you're all going to think this is a terrible map, but I put my heart and soul into it, so please be curtious and give me as much negative feedback as you can so I may make a better map next time. I am also willing to alter this map somewhat if you want something cooler on it."
