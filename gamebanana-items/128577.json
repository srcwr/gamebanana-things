The idea came from when I was playing in a Pub which the maps were all MiniGame type, and I LOVED IT! so I've come with this one.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nTerrors.\r\nKill all the CTs before the time is up.\r\n\r\nCounter Terrors.\r\nEscape from the terrorists in order to survive for a minute. Then Terrors will automaticly die.\r\n\r\nThe glass plataforms will individualy break in 10 secs after a player hits it (Any player) .\r\n\r\n<div>Have Fun playing this map.</div>\r\nThanks to Solid Snake who gave me the idea. He may not know. but he did =)\r\n\r\nThe name of this map has a reason. This map cost me all my saturday :|\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
