	"_sText": "This map is actually based on \"aim_ag_texture_s_extreme\", a map I really loved to play. But that map was pretty vacant because of its size. Furthermore the vulnerability against people playing awp pissed me off.\r\nSo I made the map a little bit more advanced.\r\nThe result is a huge system of catacombs and a network of bridges and ladders in the upper part of the map.\r\nIt's really funny to snipe on the map but you can also get every sniper from behind on that map.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can play the map on 83.142.84.234:27040"
