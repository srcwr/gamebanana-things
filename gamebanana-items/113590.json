	"_sText": "This map is a remake of a CS 1.6 map originally created by Spuoces\r\ni remade the map completely from scratch, i have added  a lot to the map from the original cs version. It was a great map in 1.6 and still is in source.\r\n<b><u>Changes/Additions</u></b>\r\n- the sizes of some areas have changed a bit\r\n- i have added  a landscape instead\r\n- i have added a lot more detail to the water as well as the landscape\r\n- it has displacements almost every where you look\r\n- there is a shark that swims through the water\r\n- the ladder in t spawn is not a rope ladder\r\n- t spawn is a lot different\r\n- i added a lot more detail to the beach\r\n\r\n<b><u>Fun Facts</u></b>\r\n- you can get onto the fishing boats \r\n- the shark will eventually kill you\r\n- you can get onto the roof of the main building as well as the little shack\r\n- there are indeed buy zones they are on the floating platforms \r\n- 20 spawn points\r\n- have fun ! \r\n\r\nIf you come across any bugs or things you would like changed let me know.\r\nI may make a version 2 with a custom tuned nav file, possibly with more sharks and maybe even birds in the sky as well as more spawn points.\r\n\r\n"
