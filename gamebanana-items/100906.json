The map has three stories, so to speak: roof, ground, tunnel. I am aiming for balance, and I wish that you would try this map with your friends, on your servers etc. and give feedback on the balance and if you find any bugs or if the map is lacking something. It's not a very pretty map, it has some props here and there to make it look a bit more living but it's not yet finished on that part."
