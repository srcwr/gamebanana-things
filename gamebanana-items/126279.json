Get it back!\r\n========================================\r\n**Short and quite simple bhop map with some kz mixed in.**\r\n\r\nOriginal map was created by Yeckoh for our Zombie Master 1 bunnyhop server back in 2012. The intention was to create a really simple map that even new bhoppers could beat. We then decided to port it to CSS (along with some others maybe :>). We improved on it a little and then forgot about it for a while... Here it is!\r\n\r\nI am releasing it on behalf of Yeckoh.\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLegit/400vel possible."
