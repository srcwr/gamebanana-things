And i thought..\r\nThats too little of a change to upload it to FPSBanana.. \r\nSo i added a basement , and guns down there. and added lots of other random stuff.\r\n\r\nThe basement is a little darker , because its a basement..\r\n\r\nI added two walk ways on the side , opposed to one in the middle.\r\n\r\nWell , I really hope you enjoy this version. Alot better in my opinion..\r\n\r\nNote: Its brighter in-game!\r\n\r\n"
