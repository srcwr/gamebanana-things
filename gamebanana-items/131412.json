	"_sText": "I saw a smaller version of this in another map by tkellaway(which has been trashed), and thought \"hey.. this would be cool in a full size map.\"  So I made one for my server.  This map is great when you only have a few players on your server, and want something to do without having to go to a map that is WAY too big.  I recommend this one for every zombie server, especially the startups.\r\n\r\nBasically, it consists of 810 breakable boxes 9x9x10.  You build your own path to make a hiding spot, or break away all of the boxes around you to keep the zombies from getting to you.  I think everyone will enjoy this!"
