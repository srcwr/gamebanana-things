Originally it was going to be quite hard, but I decided to fix it up and deal with yet another 11 minutes of waiting (compiling).<br><br>----------<br><br>The map is based around one gigantic center room, with rooms jutting out from the sides. I had this idea in my head for a while, and originally the map was going to have a sun, but I decided the dark red neon look was much better than just a regular sun.<br><br>Difficulty: Medium-Hard<br>Length: 30 seconds - 1 minute<br><br>Special thanks goes to cswalrus, raz, Antosha, and Shadow for showing up during the stream.<br><br>-----------<br><br>WARNING: This map is <i>Really bright.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; It is recommended you play with low gamma/brightness.<br><br>Edit: If you get stuck, r_drawclipbrushes 2 is your friend."
