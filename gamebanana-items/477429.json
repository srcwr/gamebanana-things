	"_sText": "<span class=\"RedColor\"><b>Important Note!</b></span><br>This map was originally intended to be fully made which would have been published by the name ze_True_Backrooms. The map was too large to be real, although it would be possible to still complete it considering that I made 12 levels of the Backrooms Legend by Creepypasta. The map exceeded 9,000 solids and I still hadn't implemented the logic aka triggers, gameplay, bosses. Only the layout was exceeding 10,000 solids. It could be reduced if I used propper but map was simply too large and required a real amount of hardwork. Considering I had to ripoff the models and everything from original game itself but it would have been a waste of time since the playerbase wouldn't even care to play. So I decided to choose the best Backrooms level from my original map which was the most suitable in terms of gameplay and it was <b>Level 3 - The Electrical Station</b>. The gameplay is at 5min max. Just needed to complete the unfinished business. <br><br><b><span class=\"GreenColor\">Gameplay</span></b><br>You need to complete 3 zones in the map by finding all the triggers in the station and finding your way out of the eerily walls of the Backrooms. To restore your sanity, 1 almond water will spawn in this level and will heal you to max hp.This level is unstable and consists of entities like Hounds. For this map will require a good amount of teamwork and it can also be played to speedrun it. Find your way inside the station to complete all zones. The password is <del><span class=\"RedColor\">HIDE</span></del>.<br><br><b class=\"SelectedElement\">Map also contains <span class=\"GreenColor\">ETERNAL Darkness Mode</span>. All lights will be turned off and thick fog will engulf the survivors.Good Luck & HaveFun. </b><br><br>Your feedback would be appreciated by letting me know if there are any bugs or if something lacks. I'll consider to add if something lacked and the feedback would be credited."
