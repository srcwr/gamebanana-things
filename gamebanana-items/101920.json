This should be a good map for lan parties and 32 man games  Me and my buddies have had 6 man matches but thats all.  Its a great map if you dont like snipers because you have a lot of coverage but if you are in the open, you are pretty much doomed to the auto snipers.  \r\n\r\n Enjoy and post back\r\n    Zeke"
