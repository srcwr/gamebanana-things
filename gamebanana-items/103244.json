The old version was not even compiled on full and did not contain many func_detail brushes at all. This version however, is compiled on full and i have converted a few complex brushes to props to help with the fps.\r\n\r\nSince this map was created i have learn't alot and the only reason for it being updated is because of some pestering messages i have received via youtube."
