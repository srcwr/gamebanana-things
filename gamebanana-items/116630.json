	"_sText": "This map is a stealth map which means everything will be dark. Everyone is given a USP and knife. There is no buy zone.\r\n\r\nSpawn points are separated so don't expect the help of your teammates straight away. There are some boxes and vending machines to hide behind.\r\nMake sure (if your host) mp_flashlight 1 is on!!! Also i recommend less than 8 players so you can sneak more.\r\n\r\nNote: I know that there i no prop for the light because i thought it wasn't necessary for it is just to help guide the player."
