A castle sprawling across floating blocks, with a small village developed around it.A peaceful, magical world no doubt, But alas, this world is not perfect for all. A bunch of terrorists have decided to demonstrate their contempt by exploding the castle. As this plot unfolds, a group of villagers, well equipped with anti-terrorism equipment have decided to stop them. Both sides now fight to establish their beliefs in the skies. "
