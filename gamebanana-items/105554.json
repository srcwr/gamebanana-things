In my opinion a big issue of the original map is that 2 persons left at the end of a round will merely find each other. To avoid such situations I created the map much more open.\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#ffaa00\">Changelog:</font>\r\n- City surrounding\r\n- Lightning overworked\r\n- Wider alleys\r\n- Moved \"CT-Ladder\"(leading to the roof of hallway) to the right\r\n- 48 Spawnpoints\r\n- It's possible to jumb from the 2 palms to the ropes of the  high CT-building and the T-building\r\n- Textures changed\r\n- More minor changes\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://de.xfire.com/screenshots/aimagtexturecity3k/\">More Screenshots in 1600*900</a>\r\n"
