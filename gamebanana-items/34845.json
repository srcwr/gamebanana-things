Also added detailed place names, so you'll always know from bots, where the enemies are.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to note one thing: when bots are trying to go down the ladder into the tunnel, if you are passing close - break the boards, which close passage, because bots don't do it (I do not know why), and therefore can not come down so long as the passage is closed.\r\n\r\nHave fun! ;D\r\n\r\n\tUPDATE 12.07.2014:\r\n\tNow bots destroying boards without problems. Thanks to Meurglis3 for it"
