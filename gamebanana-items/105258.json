Playing the map after I realized the the rooms are probably a bit big for the lack of stuff in them but Hammer doesn't really have a lot of props to work with for house building and stuff...plus im kinda a n00bi3. Hopefully you enjoy it as well. Im getting more and more into mapping and look forward to more maps from me! Thanks for downloading/looking at the map!\r\n\r\n"
