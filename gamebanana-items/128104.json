	"_sText": "New in this version compared to mg_Hide_n_Seek_Office;<br><ul><li>Switched from using targetnames and trigger_hurts when shooting as a seeker to a point_hurt, it's now impossible to take damage unless you actually shoot.</li><li>Fixed some props that wouldn't recieve the correct lighting.</li><li>Seekers now get glocks rather than a knife/shotguns to prevent people from auto-shooting without taking any damage (use burst fire for best effect, won't die by right clicking anymore).</li><li>The outside lighting is a bit off on the office part compared to the real cs_office, this is because you can only use one light_environment per map, so I went with the one from assault.</li></ul>This will probably be the last version of the map, unless I find better ways to do things. Enjoy!"
