I devised several different pathways to be\r\nopened up in the map, which are picked at random after every spawn.  This means\r\nthat the way a player went one round will most likely not be available to him/her\r\nnext round. This makes the game a bit more adaptive.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n-----------------\r\n  * There are no buy zones in this map.  Deagles, kevlar armor\r\n    and helmets are given to each player at the beginning of \r\n    the map.\r\n  * There is one custom texture used in this map, and it was\r\n    added to the BSP file using bspzip, meaning there are no\r\n    textures needing to be unzipped, making it for easier\r\n    installation. 1/2 of the texture is on the billboard on\r\n    one of the walls, and the other is in an easter egg room\r\n    located below the center of the warehouse.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nShoutouts:\r\n----------\r\n\r\nKaijin (a great mapper), Mugen, CIN, Guinness, Devilman, DUNC4N,\r\nF0RG0TTEN, and everyone else over at AHP.\r\n\r\nContact Info:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis map was developed to be played on the After Hours Pub\r\n(AHP) CS:S server.
