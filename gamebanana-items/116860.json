Each team cut their own spawns into the tree and are getting ready to bounce across the side of it. If you fall you will bounce back up again to rejoin your team in the ultimate fight.\r\n\r\nI wanted to create this map for a diferent look into mapping and making something that everyone can get some fun out of. Thanks for everyone that helped me create this and let me use things like textures. \r\n\r\nNote: this is only a first beta version. Your feedback will be used to make the map better for everyone.\r\nI hope you love playing this map as much as I have making. Thanks, drimp.\r\n\r\n<b>(video to come)</b>\r\n\r\nThings to do:\r\n- add more detail and better brushwork.\r\n- use peoples feedback to make it better.\r\n- get better lighting and custom skybox.\r\n- change some textures.\r\n- try to somehow create a nav.\r\n- add fpsb logo.\r\n- upgrade 3dskybox.\r\n- other things."
