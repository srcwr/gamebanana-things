	"_sText": "<hr /><b>Details:</b><br />\r\nThis is my remake of the Halo 2 map Turf. I decided to set it up as a de map since its so perfectly designed for that gametype. It has some lighting problems still, but i decided to just release it since im not getting anywhere trying to fix them hahaha. \r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b><br />\r\n34 spawns, 2 bomb zones, free-swinging doors (shoot them or run into them to push them open), ramps that drop into position when you touch them, 3D skybox, and obsessively detail, full buyzones, custom textures, and a few easter eggs.\r\n\r\n<br />Please visit <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/studios/2377\">Clan 5k3's studio</a> for more Halo css maps and materials."
