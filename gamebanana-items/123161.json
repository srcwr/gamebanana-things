	"_sText": "I made this map to be a bit different from most surf maps. Most maps have a long surf where you either end up in jail or the top of jail. This is a freestyle surf witch is compact so you can battle it out anywhere in the map. Instead of a jail, you get teleported to an open area where you are vulnerable to attack. Lots of areas to snipe from means more combat, enjoy!\r\n\r\nMax Players: 34\r\nMade for DM and non-DM servers\r\nOverveiw is inculded for radar"
