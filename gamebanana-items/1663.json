	"_sText": "This is another version of my first prefab which I wasn't very happy with. I basically just retextured it, enlarged it to fit more than one person and added a few more lasers so people couldn't get out ( Before there was big gaps.) I also made it hang by chains as well as added little places where the lasers come from. I apologize because I couldn't make holders for the side lasers as my vertex tool decided it was going to be mean to me. :( Well anyways hope you like it, was thinking it'd be good for a change for like a surf jail or something. Oh btw, I added a simple telporter ( Its in the 2nd last screenshot ) So you can just add that where you like. :) Enjoy, any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated. It really helped me improve it from its old form so yeah maybe I could get some more Ideas. If you're unsure what the last screenshot is , its just showing how the cage is hanging by chains."
