It has 32 spawns,\r\nbut i don't recommend that many players..\r\nIt's perfectly mirrored with tunnels leading from both spawns to middle area.\r\nYou can also climb up to the sides of the map via the towers in either spawn, or via a ladder in the tunnels.\r\n\r\nThe map also includes a custom nav file for bots,\r\ncomplete with location names (like TSpawn, Middle etc.)\r\n\r\nI have now ported this over to CS:GO, so head over here to subscribe :)\r\n[Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=149990405)\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nMap made by Sir_Parkinglot A.K.A.
