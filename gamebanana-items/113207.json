	"_sText": "This is an FY map where the player spawns w/ a Mac10.  There is a buyzone in the center, just like in fy_iceworld.  Players can climb the catwalk and even stagger out on the cables which support it.  Players can also jump down from the catwalk and run across the 4 square pillars in the center of the map.  I think the lighting is pretty well done and can't wait to play it!  If you download it, please let me know how it plays with real people.  This is my 3rd map in 5 years from the old 1.5 CS and love playing these quick maps.  Happy hunting!"
