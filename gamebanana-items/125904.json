	"_sText": "Map theme is based off random textures that I picked out that I thought would look nice bunched together.  All textures used in this map are default (since this is my first map and wanted a simple map). Around 2 min run average. Very basic lighting, basic detail, basic everything... If you enjoy the map please feel free to comment, I would love to know what I did well and what I can improve on."
