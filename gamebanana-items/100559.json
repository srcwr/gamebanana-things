	"_sText": "This map has a relativly simple formula. Like most hostage rescue maps, the CTs have to assault the building from multiple points, grab the hosties and not die in the process. There are two ways to enter the building for the CTs, either through the front door or the side door/ladder. Both are very close to the terrorist spawn point, and a slow CT team will be cut off in no time. The counter-terrorists really have to work as a team here to win, since the map has so many narrow staircases and hallways with quick turns. This map isn't the best one around, but it is very popular, so I decided it would be best to review and add it here.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: yellow; font-size: xx-Small\">Review by Milkman.</p>"
