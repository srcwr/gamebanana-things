It has a couple bugs but there not to bad, just a mis alignment with a couple of things.\r\n\r\nFrom my personal testing this is a good map for a beginner to start practicing and i hope that it is used by at least a few people.\r\n\r\nunless something goes wrong ill be making more and better maps in the future. have fun and enjoy. :)"
