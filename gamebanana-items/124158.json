Will consider using only cubemap based water if complaints will gather up.\r\n<br><br><br>BACKGROUND STORY\r\n<br><br>================\r\n<br><br>Hi everybody! \r\n<br><br>So I have created levels for Counter Strike Source, as many others have done before me. However with the level I'm providing custom content and want to give some background story to it.\r\n<br><br>It all was created around a concept that came to mind one day, which I will tell you more about in a moment, and apart from that inspiration also came from the GunGame levels with orange and grey color themes and their very clean level design. I thought maybe I could add something to these levels so they still are basic but yet look bit more interesting.\r\n<br><br>What it landed in was me producing new similarly themed textures and several basic models that can be used as physics, static or dynamic objects. Some of the boxes are breakable - the small blue and orange ones you'll see in the video - and this can introduce an interesting factor. We have destructible world, but of course in a very simplistic form. We won't be taking down skyscrapers like in Battlefield 4 ;) .\r\n<br><br>Also some will draw parallels too MineCraft because of the blocks but I'm not trying to bring that game into CSS but rather an own concept,  a futuristic one with sci-fi elements added.\r\n<br><br>This level you see here <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOvUEHqzmWU \" vertigo\"\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOvUEHqzmWU</a> is called \"Vertigo\" and it's a tight map and yet with plenty of alternative paths and even teleport points. It will offer both fast paced gameplay and some sneaky sneaky moments.\r\n<br><br>I suppose it fits best for gameplay with about maximum 10 people.\r\n<br><br>Let me know what you think and how the levels work for you. These two levels are after all my first MP levels and I don't know if everything works as it should. The only thing I know is that the BOT navigation can be improved. Vertigo is not the typical level and so there the BOTs of one team fail miserably despite using some navigation mesh guides. I need to look into more advanced \"nav\" commands.\r\n<br><br>There is polish left to do on the levels but at this time for personal reasons I will not be making anything more so I'm releasing the stuff as is. Might do some updates in the future.\r\n<br><br>So back to the other part of the main idea. It's called \"Tekky Boxes\"! They are orange and black box robots. Both of them are in the level \"LunarArena\", a level with a main base that is surrounded by a desolate moon landscape and they are there to collect their precious blue crystals. \r\n<br><br>The orange version of the box is known as a \"BoomBox\" and slides around in the level communicating randomly in it's own robot language.\r\n<br><br>You need to watch out for these AND make proper tactical use of them. They are explosive.. very explosive, and with many of them chain reactions occur. You need eyes in your back to make sure you stay alive. \r\n<br><br>Shooting them while your enemy is near one will actually add a kill to your stats. \r\n<br><br>It can be quite funny sometimes, you shoot a box and it starts burning and changes direction heading right at you. You better run as it can explode any time.\r\n<br><br>The dark  version of the \"Tekky Box\" is to be considered friendly or neutral.\r\n<br><br>VIDEO of LunarArena &amp; LunarArena at night:\r\n<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi3-X7BEEog \" lunararena\"\"=\"\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi3-X7BEEog</a>\r\n<br><br>So Tekky Boxes basically adds another dimension to the existing gameplay. A final note on the concept is that I have created a massive sized BoomBox which when touched changes the gravity of the level and you can do massive jumps. The gravity is toggled each time the large Master robot is touched.\r\n<br><br>I'll add  some VMFs too soon you can look into the settings of the lighting, props.\r\n<br><br>Thanks for reading this wall of text! :)<br><br>"
