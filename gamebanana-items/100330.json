	"_sText": "Author: Titan1x77\n\nName: cs_pawtucket_beta1\n\nRelease notes: .nav, custom textures and radar overviews are packed into the BSP\n\nType: Hostage rescue; 64 spawns, 16v16 is ideal for this map.\n\nDescription: Medium/large intense map with quick routes to hostages, spawns are scattered and CT's can rush either area holding hosties quickly and in most cases beat the T's if they spawn in other area of hosties. Garage doors can be operated and even broken. Which will cause doors to fall and crush anyone under them. Ct's must rush and not let T's camp in many hiding places. This map may seem T sided until CT's find the quick routes and the many rescue zones located around the map. I suggest looking at the map overlay while spectating before jumping into this somewhat overly complicated map. Lot's of breakable doors and floors, and even 2 shotguns laying around. Lot's of hiding areas and secret areas not noticed at first glance.\n\nBuild notes: Completely redone from the DE version.... sat on my hard drive for months, possibly a year now. Black ops has taken up my time during that period.\n\nEnjoy!"
