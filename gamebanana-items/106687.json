	"_sText": "This is simple map that is made of 9 romms interconected in a 3x3 form, like a computer's numpad. It's 4vs4, so a maxium of 8 players can play at the same time, CTs are spawned in the 9th romm and the Ts are spawned in t 1st room. No light are made on the map, so it's preferable to enable the flashlight. The \"fun\" fact of this map is the lack of lights, which makes it harder and even scarier xD. In the updated version all players start with a deagle and a knife.\r\n\r\nThere is an old 1vs1 version you may want to give a try: http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/152648"
