	"_sText": "This is an early preview of the new soccer map worked on by me and mr bubbles.\r\nI've had this version for about a month and haven't been able to really add anything to it, so I'll release what's done so far.\r\n\r\nThere's a sleek looking stadium with moving crowds, and working scoreboards on both sides of the field.\r\nA 'ball cam' moves around the stadium.\r\nThere are floodlights around the stadium that, as soon as i work out a way to do it without creating lag, will turn on at night time.\r\nI'm working on a script to make this map change the skybox, field lights, and darkness to simulate night and day. (this script is not included as it's very buggy atm)\r\n\r\nThere is still much to do in this map. some things are a bit ugly.. but most of the functionality is there.\r\nIt's a bit dark because there is a problem stopping it from compiling in vvis.\r\n\r\nAs with my v4 and v5 maps you can customize alot of the textures and settings manually or using the included MapEdit program.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\nType these commands in chat to perform certain actions with the autoref script.\r\n<strong>!ref</strong> -- Brings up a referee menu to control manual aspects of the ref script. you must be set as an admin in the autoref config for !ref and !setteams.<br />\r\n<strong>!setteams [team1here] [team2here]</strong> -- Set teams for the ref script. Use underscores for spaces. For the newer scoreboards since 2008_v6, use full-stops to center the team.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the map and map customizing scripts, you can optionally install my soccer (gameplay) scripts, available here: <a href=\"http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/soccer\">http://addons.eventscripts.com/addons/view/soccer</a>\r\n\r\nThey work for every setting different league/clans use.\r\nExtremely customisable. they record personal player stats (viewable in-game and on a webserver), Limit knives-per-minute,\r\nDisable knifing, Control health/god-mode options (including a commbox-as-bloodbin script),\r\nAutomatically referee (for clan/league matches), Control an in-game scoreboard on a special map,\r\nSlay people jumping on goals, Set separate skins for goalies and teams,\r\nAnd automatically load the scripts upon changing to a soccer map."
