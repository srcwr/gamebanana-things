	"_sText": "This is my first try at a proper map. I decided to try and make an aim_ map as i thought it would be the easier option for a beginner. The map has random gaps in the boxes which are all head height. This gives a different element to the map rather than the plain and simple run around. There are also awp spots behind the spawn points which you can reach by going up the invisible ladders on sides. There are a total 20 spawns (10 ct's 10 t's). \r\n\r\nI am aware that the map maybe a little small but i think it is an OK size if there was to be cup matches on this map e.g. 2v2 - 5v5"
