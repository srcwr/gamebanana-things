All custom textures, so its a visually fresh map lol. Ive been told it came out very well by those who tested the beta, so i think you will all like it.\n\n<b>Specs:</b><br />\n40 spawns, Custom textures, custom Skybox, Buyzones\n\n<br />Please visit <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/studios/2377\">Clan 5k3's studio</a> for more Halo css maps and materials."
