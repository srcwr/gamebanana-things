	"_sText": "About: gg_jurisdiction, 24 player slot capacity dev map. Both teams have their own spawn opposite each other. 4 towers surround the outside followed by a larger tower in the center. Ramps from all sides lead to the top and stairs travel up and down to the 4 lower towers. Plenty of places to hide and take cover from are located at the bottom, while the top tower is rather bare.\r\nOther: I came up with this map after playing UT3, the map was sunrise (i think). My map tho is very very different tho. & please comment."
