I've added a little area that should keep you relatively occupied as you try to get to it and get gunned down in the process, and a decent selection of guns as well.\r\n\r\nThe guns available in the map are:\r\n\r\nXM1014\r\nM4A1\r\nM249\r\nAWP\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting to the AWP is easy, even though it seems blocked off. Try finding the M249 ;)"
