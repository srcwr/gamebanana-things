A laser shoots out the lower bit, requiring you jump over it to battle your opponent.\r\n\r\n(YAY) Short Story: Tom_Tom's scientists have discovered the power of LaZoRs. They constructed the laser in their science warehouse thing. Soon after the laser went crazy and began cutting his scientists in half :*(. \r\n\r\nEnjoy, max players 14. Size small.\r\n\r\nPLEASE COMMENT!!!!!"
