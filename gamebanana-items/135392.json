It is pretty small mainly for a small group, I've only tested with up to 3 players per team (6 altogether).  Bots do not use the outside part mainly because they can't scale the boxes.  There are two hidden rooms one is a knife arena (breakable brush sticking out of the wall outside) and the other is a square room right outside of Terrorist spawn (the wall is a different color, shoot that).  There is no .nav file.  All custom texture are packed into the .bsp, you won't have to download them seperately.  It does include a buyzone for each team if you'd like to play with some bots in your own server.\r\n\r\nP.S. Boogle and Foogi and DearDoctorQ are the same person/user just known by different names"
