That's a battle arena. The only goal to reach is to kill the opposite team.<br>There're two hidden weapons in the map.<br><br>Have a good game !<br><br><h1><i>Contact :</i></h1><h3>Via Steam <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997334142\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997334142</a></h3><h3>Via Skype martin.scellier</h3>"
