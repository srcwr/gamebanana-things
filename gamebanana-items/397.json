	"_sText": "i gave up trying to make this map work because i was stuck for ideas and i though i was just ruining what i started, i also gave up on it as it would take a very long time to compile at the PortalFlow stage and i couldnt figure out why so i just removed the skybox to make it easier for the mapper who wants this unfinished map.\r\n\r\nMy original style of the map was goint to be a mix between Surf_Egypt & Surf_10x_final with the two side maps with you are teleported to, thought that would make fun gameplay. \r\n\r\nNOTE: please contact me if you decide you want to carry the map on as ill help out on parts if wanted and please credit me :( just stick my name on a wall or something you know :D lol.\r\n\r\nSteam: Justin_UK\r\nMSN: Justinn09@live.co.uk\r\n"
