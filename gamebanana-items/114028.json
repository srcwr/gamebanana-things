My team leader \"Shady\" has made a very special map for the community to enjoy and I would like present it to everyone to download and enjoy. This map is called fy_revelation and it is a futuristic rendition of a iceworld map, but much nicer!\r\n\r\nThis .RAR file has everything you need to host this map on your server. We have thoroughly tested this map and it has very minimal lag time. This is a great public server map and everyone should have the chance to have it as part of the public maps on their servers.\r\n\r\n[Staff snip-edited]\r\n\r\nHere is a public server that we have for everyone to see it for themselves: 67.18.72.130:27015 Thanks goes to \"Shady\" and his hard work for making such a fine map. Jim Owner www.team1ph.com and www.1powerhost.com"
