	"_sText": "This is a remake of Complex from the best FPS on Nintendo 64- Perfect Dark. One of my favorite games of all time, and my fav map to play on, I have redone for CS:S. It's simple- not a lot of physics, not a lot of detail, I know this. I've done this purposly because the origional game did not have such features. Although I have added the source touch to it, it's not a heavy one.\r\n\r\n I started this map back for CS 1.6, but never finished it, and decided that it'd look better on Source (it does, of course). After over 1 year of working on and off this map I have finally finished it and released it as Beta 1. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nAs usual, suggestions, error, bugs, e-mail me at NeoGlitch822@yahoo.com"
