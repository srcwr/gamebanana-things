	"_sText": "Place the map in your cstrike/maps folder\r\n\r\nThis is a smash map.\r\n\r\nThere is 1 terrorist and 32 CT slots.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is for the CT's to run the course as quickly as they can. The first to reach the end will see an AWP on the floor. Pick it up to kill the T from either far away or from triggering a teleport.\r\n\r\nThe object for the T is to use the cannon (by pressing your use key on the button) and move the cannon around with \"wasd\" and fire the cannon at the CT's with \"left mouse button\".\r\n\r\nYou may ask, \"Can't the T just shoot ahead of the map?\" No. There are doors placed in front of the pillars that block that from happening. When one CT reaches a point in front of the next section it will make the door go down, allowing the T to shoot at that spot.\r\n\r\nThe map isn't 100% foul proof, but it is more of a test on a different idea that I have yet to see.\r\n\r\n Currently tested it on a server with 10 players and everyone had a blast. Hope you do to.\r\n\r\n*recommends at least 2 players but not required to test the maps functions. Also recommended on a NoBlock Server."
