	"_sText": "<div class=\"SelectedElement\">Anthology is a jailbreak map originally made by Hidden, ported to TF2 by Theodore. Edited by rvrb &amp; pancakes for CSS. The map was ported by Theodore to Team Fortress 2. I remember the map in TF2. I looked for the CSS map everywhere, and it was forgotten in time. The CSS map was presumably played in Commonwealth Gaming (2012-2013?). The map branding is Burning Baby Productions. That made me ask Theodore if he still had the CSS map file. He did not, however, have a decompiled .vmf of a presumed decompiled CSS version (6/23/2013). rvrb and I decided to work on the map to bring the map back into CSS with edits and optimization, as a lot has deteriorated since then.</div><br><br>Minigames:<br><br>Tic-Tac-Toe<br><br>WipeOut<br><br>Pool<br><br>Theatre<br><br>Soccer<br><br>Connect 4<br><br>Deathrun<br><br>Basketball<br><br>Race<br><br>"
