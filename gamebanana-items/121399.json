I think it turned out pretty well.\r\n\r\nThis map is created for low gravity just like Scoutzknivez (Tested on gravity 220, and airaccelerate 470)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to ultrAslan for many of the ideas he gave me to put into this map.\r\n\r\nThanks to Nosoul for a lot of help in fixing it up from my previous release \r\n\r\nAnd thanks to Tyrantar for the idea of more props / detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom previous release I have:\r\n\r\n1.) Added more props / cover / detail\r\n\r\n2.) Removed some cubemaps and placed them more effectively, reducing the random white glows, and overall making it look better\r\n\r\n3.) Added decals instead of those shitty brushes using decal textures\r\n\r\n4.) Added a light in the middle room\r\n\r\nAnd probably a bit more I've forgotten to mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this map is strafing, just like what SK kind of turned into, however, this one has more cover so those people that can't strafe still stand a great chance. Players can use the many props to help give a more exciting strafing experience. I actually had quite a good time strafing alone on it, xD.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<font color=blue><font size=4><u>Currently In cycle on:</u><font size=2><font color=lightblue>\r\n\r\n<i> 208.100.14.232:27015\r\n<i> 208.167.232.72:27015\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<font color=white>Please let me know when you add this map to your servers so I may add it to the list!\r\n\r\n</i><b>\r\n\r\n<Font color=lime> <font size=3> This is for all you SK fans out there, so don't forget to fav it!!</font></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"280\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fzzhrJxGk-M&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fzzhrJxGk-M&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"280\"></embed></object>"
