The car is free to be used by anyone, and free to be re-distributed so long as you keep the included text document with it.\r\n\r\nThanks to scytha -- I liked</font> <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/231\">his police car</a> <font color=\"#6666FF\">but wanted something more so I heavily modified it.  This version only kept the letters he had, nothing else, and those were also modified.\r\n\r\nAnyone who intends to use the prefab should read the .txt file.</font>"
