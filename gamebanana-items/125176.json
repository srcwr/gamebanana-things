Very fast paced especially towards the end, and I tried to make this a bit harder to one shot than my other maps since one of the main critiques I tend to get is that my maps are 'too easy to run'<br><br>Also has a 25-30s bonus.<br><br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Here's a shitty vid I made of a segment a friend did incase anyone wants to see the gameplay.<br><br><br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xu4HLG7NdMw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br>"
