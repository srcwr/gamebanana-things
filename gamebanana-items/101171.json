Defend this beacon until signal is recieved and reinforcements are en route.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: A leak in intellegence has alerted your organization to several Covert Ops in the area. Undoubtedly they will be attempting to alert their superiors as to the location of your organization. Stop them at all costs or disrupt the signal by planting a bomb in certain spots on any of the buildings.\r\n\r\n<div>Notes: This is beta1. I do not intend to continue to finish this map due to lack of interest. However it is playable at this point, although still a little ugly. If people like this map, and truly desire further work on it, I may reconsider pushing further with this map. </div>"
