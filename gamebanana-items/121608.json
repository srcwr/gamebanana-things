	"_sText": "Welcome to surf AKRON NOOBS.  Thats right!  This map was made with the surfers of Akron in mind.  Basically so when they, well a select few, will get either overly frustrated or just cry when they decide to surf it!\r\n\r\nOtherwise besides that bit of input, it is a moderate surf with a few secrets nothing major though. \r\n\r\nJust a fun map for surfers of all levels.  Honestly though, if you are a noob surfer, don't even try.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n(Comments on the map itself please.  How the surf is/what could be change/added etc.)"
