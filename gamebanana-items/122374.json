Note that the teleporter between the first 2 ramps of bonus is not the end but just the escape teleporter. The end of bonus can be beaten by entering the trigger and WALK towards the end.\r\n\r\nThis map has been on my computer for 1.5 years, so in fact, yeah, it took  1.5 years to finish (also counting the many months I did nothing about it)\r\n\r\nFinally it's here! Enjoy!"
