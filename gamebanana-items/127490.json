	"_sText": "This map is the remastered version of trikz_dual which was posted months ago.\r\n\r\nAll the levels were retextured with shining textures and improved to do the map as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are only 4 spawns (2 per team).\r\n\r\nThis map was made for sv_airaccelerate 10 and can be easily used as tournament map.\r\n\r\nThe map is composed of many levels which are 1 flashboost, 4 stackboosts, 2 runboost, 1 surf + bhop (made for aa10), 1 skyjump, 1 xc, and 3 little bhops.\r\n\r\nGood Luck & Have Fun :D\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I added to the download .zip trikz_dual_1team, the training version of the map which contains 24 spawns CT."
