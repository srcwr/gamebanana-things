	"_sText": "Can You Survive?\r\n==================\r\n\r\nHold out on top of Mercy Hospital until the choppers arrive! You are stranded on top of the roof of the tallest building in the city. The military is about to bomb the place, but you were able to radio them for help and they could spare three choppers to send. Survive long enough and escape before the whole place is blown up!\r\n\r\n### About the map:\r\n\r\n- Made from scratch, no copying / porting of any content\r\n\r\n- 64 spawns points\r\n\r\n- Color correction for improved visuals and lightning effects\r\n\r\n- Rain ambiance\r\n\r\n- Fog\r\n\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n\r\n- Three helicopters\r\n\r\n- Nuke!\r\n\r\n- Helicopters crash if zombies take over (so the round actually ends!)\r\n\r\n- Modified / added some spots to improve gameplay for zombie mod\r\n\r\n\r\n### Specifics:\r\n\r\nHold out for three minutes. Three choppers arrive, each one passing by two drop off points. When the choppers arrive, a hurt box, whose only point is to slow down zombies, activates, giving everyone a chance to make a run for it! If a terrorist (zombie) is detected on a helicopter past a certain point, the chopper will blow up.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Future plans:\r\n\r\n- Finish bomb defuse version...\r\n\r\n- Make chopper explosions look better\r\n\r\n- Make whatever tweaks necessary to balance gameplay\r\n\r\n- Improve 3d skybox"
