In the Original Duckhunt every round you switch spawns, this one is just like that except its random.(I couldn't figure a way to do it every round, so its random)  So u might play 2 rounds as the \"duck\" then 1 round as the \"hunter\" it just depends on what happens. It holds 32 players. I would recommend turning up sv_airaccelerate to 100+. I hope you have fun with this map. \r\n\r\nIF YOU PUT THIS ON YOUR SERVER TELL ME, ILL COME AND PLAY =]\r\n\r\n-Weidey\r\n\r\nExtract to your cstrike/maps folder if u wanna play single player with it."
