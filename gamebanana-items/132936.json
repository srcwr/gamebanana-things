	"_sText": "I edited a previous map from Papycss called zm_zomb_lilapanic_3towers_v2, it was on a server where I play but it was leaked and people were falling underneath the map.\r\nI recreated it after they said I was allowed to edit it and this is what I came up with.\r\n\r\nDifferent textures.\r\nAdded sun.\r\nFixed leaks.\r\nMade the top area smaller, keep action in one place.\r\nAdded some door functions.\r\nAnti camp function, very affective!.\r\nSome breakables on triggers to equal the balance.\r\n\r\nIt's a very zombie friendly map, probably unbalanced in favour of zombies :P\r\nDone it quite a wile ago and it works well on the server and it's settings where I plays so I thought I would add it here.\r\nDone it quite a wile ago that I have forgot the amount of spawns, its over 50 tho :o"
