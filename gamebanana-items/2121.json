	"_sText": "This prefab shows how it is possible to make it impossible for the player to save in the levels of a map.\r\n\r\n## **What does this prefab?**\r\nWith this method players can no longer save inside a level and teleport back to that position if they fail. They will have to start the level again.\r\n\r\n## **Why did you invented this?**\r\nI wanted to make climb a little bit more skillbased.\r\n\r\n## **Can I use this for some parts of my map only?**\r\nOf course! You deside where the player can teleport to and where not. You can enable this feature at just one level at your map or everywhere.\r\n\r\n## **How does this work?**\r\nDownload the file and take a look in the readme.\r\n\r\n## **Is there a map with that prefab, so I can test it?**\r\nYes there is. I created the map kz\\_chase\\_nocp to demonstrate that prefab. Feel free to check it out here: [http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/178798](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/178798 \"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/178798\")\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a map using this prefab, credit me and I suggest you to add \"\\_nocp\" at the end of the mapname to make it visible to the player.\r\n\r\n\r\nDotty"
