	"_sText": "Due to reports of server crashing, I have uploaded a newer version with HDR compile and no NAV.\r\n\r\nA gungame map with lots of curved twists and turns.  Includes a sidebar tunnel and some special sniper zones on the walls.  Note that the windows over the sniper zones will indicate if a player is within the sniper tube or platform (as does the sign within the building).  The map utilizes standard textures (although this map could have been a dev texture map...) but has some uncommon shapes and cover.\r\n"
