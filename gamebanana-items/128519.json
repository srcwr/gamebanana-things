	"_sText": "IF I HAVE NOT CREDITED YOU FOR SOMETHING, PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE BELOW OR SEND ME A PRIVATE MESSAGE TELLING ME.\n\nOk. This map took me about 2-3 weeks to make. It is suppost to have atleast 10+ players for it to be very fun, or else the teams will be uneven.\n\nSOME FEATURES:\n- T's can't pick up any guns.\n- T's are allowed to choose a class of a zombie.\n- There are 3 medic kits hidden in the map that give 150 hp (CT's only).\n- 7 Buildings.\n- CT's can choose their guns.\n- Boat will leave once timer runs up, anyone still on island will die.\n- Afk Killer\n- Ts are Green\n\n\nT CLASSES\n-Skinny Zombie: 150 hp; 1.2 speed.\n-Normal Zombie: 400 hp; 1.0 speed.\n-Fat Zombie: 1000 hp; 0.8 speed.\n\n\n*CT WEAPONS*\n- Deagle; 14 Bullets\n- P228; 26 Bullets\n- USP; 36 Bullets\n- M4A1; 60 Bullets\n- M3; 24 Bullets\n- Mac10; 120 Bullets\n\n\n*HOW TO PLAY*\n\nOkay, the CTs (2 at most) will choose what guns they want while the Ts choose what class they want. Once the clock hits \"2:00\" (15 seconds), the round will start and everyone will be teleported to the island. If they CTs survive for 2 minutes (besides killing all the zombies), the boat will turn on and leave. Whoever is on the boat will live, and whoever is still on the island will die from the nuke.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FIXES**\n- Lots of small (not important) stuff.\n- Can't go on fence.\n- Medic Kits give CTs 150hp\n- There is a gate to boat that is closed (opens at end).\n- Five hidden guns.\n- Fat zombie has 1000hp\n- Normal zombies has 400hp\n- Only 1 of each gun for Cts (at spawn)\n- Fixed weaponstrip glitch (i think lol)\n- Fixed teleport glitch\n- AFK killer is in the whole spawn\n- Ts are healed to their max hp (not just to 100)"
