	"_sText": "Aim_dustriver is an aim map based of a dust theme. There are m4's as the main spawn gun, and located atop the big boxes by each spawn is an AWP. Also you can find 3 frag grenades a side by the bridge. Some things to look out for are all the walls, and boxes for they are made to be spammed. You can also expect the cars to blow up, if they take enough damage. Finally the bridge pieces and can be shot out, but only a few. There are also 2 higher level towers located on each side across the spawn. "
