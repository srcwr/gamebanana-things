This map is a good map for beginners, who wants to train with bots or other players. It's made in an office style. The Maintheme is a bankrobbery with 3 hostages. Don't forget it's a beta version of the map.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow: This map has a killed hostage. You can go and shoot at him. Funny. Well uhhh ya this is the map. I made this screenshots and to tell u, I'm really good at taking this kind of photos. \r\n\r\nI'm like a... game photographer. Awesome. I really take screenshots very very carefully and make sure it's from a good angle to make the screenshots look nice. I also did the same thing for Hosties_Hijacked_Plane.\r\n\r\n[Click here to download Hosties_Hijacked_Plane](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/154404 \"Click here to download Hosties_Hijacked_Plane\")\r\n\r\nThe first three images are the buildings that are build in this map. Number 1 building is the only building that u can enter. 2 and 3 is just a wall made to look like a building. And the last 3 is the credits.\r\n\r\nWhich u can see on the sidebar. Somewhere above the download button. Anyways, ya this is the map. You guys go ahead and...DOWNLOAD!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------"
