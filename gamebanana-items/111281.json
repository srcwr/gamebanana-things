	"_sText": "Description\r\n==================\r\nThis is my third map I created for Counter-Strike: Source. I actually started making this map on the 13th of March in 2011, however, I dicided to finish it for the \"Junkyard\" contest. I have made many visual changes so it would fit the requirements for the contest. It is an abandoned Soviet factory building somewhere in the wastelands of Russia with an additional Junkyard surrounding the compound. Mostly old rusty cars end up here except for a few bigger trucks. Many years the place has been left to the nature to take it back, but now police and special forces are supposed to fight terrorism in an undisturbed place, being on their own.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n==================\r\nEquip your sniper rifles, you might want to use them. However, you can eventually get in close combat inside the factory with its many concrete blocks, or try to find a way around to attack the opposing force from behind. There are only few possibilties to hide in the outside place, you have to hurry.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n==================\r\nNote that this map has **NOT** been optimized yet! It is still in **beta**, but for now I am going for another project. I will update the map however some time.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n==================\r\nExtract the bsp-file from the zip folder into the directory\r\n\r\n**c:\\programs\\Steam\\steamapps\\[username]\\counter-strike\\source\\cstrike\\maps**\r\n\r\n(default Steam directory)\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n==================\r\n**Any feedback will be appreciated!** Tell me what you think of the Soviet style of the map and if it is a good idea to make the map that wide and\r\nopen. What should I have done better in your opinion? I would love to know!"
