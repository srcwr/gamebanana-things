	"_sText": "Me and my friend were having a mapping contest, to see who could make the best fy map,\r\nwith the basic rules of iceworld (4 blocks and such). I picked the prodigy theme, \r\nand code picked the italy theme, now were all done, and they are both pretty good maps. \r\nOne is small (Fy_Prodigy) and the other ones big (Fy_italy). Two total different gameplays, \r\nso its kinda hard to compare them. Now we know most people hate fy maps, \r\nbut this is just somthing me and my friend wanted to do, so you don't have to download it. \r\nBut if your still playing those horrible blocky iceworlds, this is the way to go."
