Like the orange and gray maps? This is for you. Made for the Elite Force gaming community (www.eliteforce.clanservers.com).\r\n***They asked me to make a small, 6v6/8v8 map, and that's what this is; it's small, and guarantees fast rounds, and heavy body pileups.***\r\nIt's a relatively small map but there's a lot of cover, and still plenty of smaller open spaces. It's meant for GunGame, and plays best as such.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: No third-party/third-person testing was done before the release of this map. If you have any problems, tell me on my FPSBanana page (\"WEBSITE\"), the EF forums (URL above), or e-mail me.
