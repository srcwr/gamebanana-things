	"_sText": "It seriously doesn't mean a map ain't good if it didn't take 10 days to make.\r\nThis, ( Don't take this as anything like cocky etc. ) is one of the examples. It took me ~4 hours to make, and it ain't a bad map. It has a unique design and nice lighting and not too complex playability.\r\n\r\nI also added the HDR effect for your you, so if your computer can handle it enable bloom!\r\n\r\nI will be maybe soon submitting another map for this particular gamemode, but the problem is I can't get it compiled because it is on my other computer and the computer crashes when I try to compile.\r\n\r\nHave fun playing this map, and don't take the game too seriously!"
