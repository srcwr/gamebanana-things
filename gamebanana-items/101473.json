Although they were\r\npreviously peaceful, one extremist group\r\nhas threatened the plant with explosives.\r\nYou must not let them succeed, or they\r\nmay just cause the disaster they were\r\ntrying to prevent.\r\n\r\nTerrorists: This is a crucial opportunity\r\nfor our movement. While recent protests\r\nhave the authorities deluded, we can now\r\neasily sneak into this so called 'chemical\r\nplant' and strike the government where it\r\nmatters. Infiltrate the plant and find their\r\n'secret shipments' and destroy them if you can. \r\nOn failing that, ignite the materials stored\r\nin the plant to show them we mean business.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/s8vG0LOJuNE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
