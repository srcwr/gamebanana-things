	"_sText": "-=Deathrun_Randomonium=-\r\n\r\nThis is a deathrun collaboration with 6 stages. The round begins in a spawn. When any player presses the button in the middle of the spawn, a stage gets selected randomly (16.6667% chance stage ''X'' gets selected). That one will be played. The CT's get teleported to the map and the T's get teleported to the trapcontrol area.\r\n\r\nEvery stage has it's own texture scheme, traps and ending.\r\n\r\nFrom there on, it works like any other deathrun map. The CT's try to avoid the traps and get to the end so they can kill the T's.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the contributors and beta testers.\r\nAlso thanks to Bravesurf for making the custom decals in the spawn and to Komaokc for the skybox.\r\n\r\nMappers:\r\n\r\nHelix\r\nSilverlol\r\nKomaokc\r\nRyan S\r\nParadoXX\r\n\r\nCollab leader: WireleZz.\r\n\r\nImportant:\r\n\r\nThe map is designed for 66 tick, but can also be played on 100 but with less smoothness. \r\nNoblock is definetly required to play this map. \r\nThere are 2 Terrorist spawns and 70 Counter-Terrorist spawns. Please disable teambalancing on your server. \r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nHelix & WireleZz"
