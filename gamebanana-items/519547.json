	"_sText": "Medium length and difficulty map made for and only tested on legit settings for 400 velcap 100 aa, but possible on all styles.<br><br>The best first experience is probably on lan since there's collectibles that are shared between all players. All collectibles can be found without use of noclip. Aside from the collectibles there are also many small secrets. People who have played the game will have an advantage in finding the collectibles.<br><br>Gameplay is not stellar since I made the environments first as this map is mostly a showcase for the textures, though every asset in the map including textures, sounds, models, and even the font for the longjump numbers are directly from the first PC Harry Potter game, with a couple exceptions. Most of the levels are nearly carbon copies of areas from the game.<br><br>Map took about a month to make and was over 99% completed back in early March but my drive with steam on it slightly died so I didn't release till now."
