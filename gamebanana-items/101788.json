Terrorists are waiting now for adequate time to attack.\r\n\r\nIt's time... The expedition's space ship's trajectory is near to the terrorists hiding-place. It's rightly occasion to steal the ship.

Other important thing - previous version wasn't stable, now it's fixed.\r\n\r\nDe_deepspace and de_spaceship_fy are kind of unussual sci-fi maps for the CS:S. They have the story, unique theme and climate. I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————————————————\r\nMAIN DIFFERENTS FROM DE_SPACESHIP_FY:\r\n\r\n- Fixed 'no free edicts' error,\r\n- Added buyzones, deleted forced equipment,\r\n- Most of the lying weapons are deleted,\r\n- Two new ways between BS A and B (shortcuts),\r\n- Improved shadows on some surfaces,\r\n- Some areas are a bit more optimized,\r\n- Some corrections of a soundscape.\r\n\r\n————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\nDesigned and made by:\r\nArtur D.
