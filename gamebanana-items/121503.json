	"_sText": "**Surf_Buck-This<br>**\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThis map is more of an intermediate freestyle surf map. **Beginners and some experienced surfers won't understand the flow.** There's little direction and because of that, it allows you to freestyle in any possible direction. \r\n\r\n\r\nConcepts to understand:<br>\r\n---------------------------\r\n- This map features bullseye windows that are portals. When hit straight on with plenty of speed, you will fly through, connecting to the next ramp. Speed is very crucial for the targets right under jail.<br>\r\n- Boosters and bounce pads - hit them in no specific direction. They're there to be hit from every direction possible.<br>\r\n\r\nNotes:<br>\r\n------\r\nI will be converting this map and my others for cs:go, stay tuned.<br>\r\n\r\nEnjoy,<br>\r\nBuck Nasty<br>\r\n\r\nMy Server: 108.60.133.162:27017"
