There are 64 spawn points.\r\n\r\nIt's in beta, so I haven't fixed some obvious little \"nags\" because I don't know if I'll be tweaking the layout.  So, there are some boxes that are floating an inch or two off the ground, and the bridge wood textures are really, really redundant!  Once the layout is finalized, I'll add a radar overview.\r\n\r\nComments are always welcome.\r\n\r\n"
