Here i come back with my AWP map, it isn't the latest version, though i took some time between the first version's launch and this one, it's because of this i never took the time to upload my map..\r\nWell, i hope you like!\r\n\r\nNew contain:\r\n\r\n-1 new CT spawn.\r\n-1 new terror spawn.\r\n-Water has been added, and it is transparent when outside of it for \"making it possible to kill ppl camping behind\".\r\n-The bonus on the roof has been added! It's an USP pistol with 12 ammo only, use before next round.\r\n-Grass.\r\n-Walls.\r\n\r\n--NOTE--\r\n\r\n-The water isn't anymore blue and transparent; why?\r\nIt was too easy to climb while still keeping to shoot, going up should take the risk of dyeing, because not only you get a pistol, but you also can surprise attack enemies! \r\n\r\n-I just saw a little bug on the map, it's the terror's room from the outside, some part of it is like their ground, it will be fixed on the next V, so don't report me, i know it."
