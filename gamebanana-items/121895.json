	"_sText": "This map has some skill elements to the surf but is primarily a combat map. Lots of guns and intentional fast gameplay.\r\n\r\nIt has been tested on 66 tick servers with sv_airaccelerate set to 150 and has no bugs or exploits that im aware of. Ive left the gameplay fairly open to keep it fun. Let me know any bugs and issues in the comments as i may consider fixing them in another version.\r\n\r\nThanks to anyone who takes the time to play or assess this map as its my first surf map id like to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\n"
