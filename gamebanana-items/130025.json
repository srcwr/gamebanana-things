I managed to finish two maps in about a week or so for the same mod. I hope you enjoy this one as much as the last one. This one was a bit easier yet there still were compile problems. Enjoy and have fun racing it.\r\n\r\nThis map was created for the portuguese FRAGXL community.\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>MAP INFO</legend>Type: Rally Race\r\nPlayers: 16 max.\r\n\r\n- Ambient sounds\r\n- HDR lightning\r\n- Simple track\r\n- Sunny weather\r\n- Real gran turismo track\r\n- 3 Laps\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset><legend>SCREENSHOT INFO</legend>Screenshot 1 - Start Zone\r\nScreenshot 2 - Map overview\r\nScreenshot 3 - One of the turns\r\nScreenshot 4 - Pit stop garages\r\nScreenshot 5 - Ready Zone\r\nScreenshot 6 - Spectator platforms\r\n</fieldset>\r\nIf you want to post this map on other forums go ahead but give me credit for my own map.
