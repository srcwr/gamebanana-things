However due to current time commitments and the age of the game, I am not going to be working on the map any longer. I will reconsider if the beta is popular enough.<br><br>It is laggy, glitchy, buggy, the AI sucks (especially the hostages) and terribly made. However it is massive, there are tons of easter eggs and fun things to do. It may make a better hide and go seek map, or perhaps even a good death match map. You decide.<br><br>In any case, feel free to let me know if any improvements you would like to see in this or any future map by myself. Please have some fun with all the hours I've put into this map."
