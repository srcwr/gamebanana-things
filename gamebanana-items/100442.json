They don't go into the mines since they can't use the elevator (maybe one day..) but they will vary their routes through the sewers or the main tunnel. And, of course, the Ts will tend to camp in a variety of places around the garage.\r\n\r\nHope you all have as much time playing it as I did making it (which was a fair bit)!"
