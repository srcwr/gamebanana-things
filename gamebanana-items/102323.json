I am aware there are a few errors (players can get through the bells and onto a handful of roofs) but im leaving them in for now for people to find and use to their advantage.\r\n\r\nLearnt ALOT making this map so i feel ive achieved something even if its not the best map out there. Took about 40 hours to make (steam claims its more like 70 but that is with rendering, testing, toilet breaks, feeding time etc)\r\n\r\nI worked on a farm last summer and though it looks nothing like this map, it gave my the idea to create the map.\r\n\r\nIt is set in a scottish spring morning with a light fog... braw! :D \r\n\r\ncheers for playing and enjoy!"
