The map is made with legit (scroll) bhop in mind (what every map should be). I went with a realistic style since it's what I prefer to do when I'm mapping. The difficulty of the map is just an old classic mp bhop that almost everyone can complete since it's easy and medium. There are also a lot of checkpoints, which gives the player a better experience. There is also 5-6 <code>easter eggs</code> in the map.<br><br>- This map couldn't have been completed without the help of those people. So thx alot again.<br><br>- <a class=\"MemberLink \" href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/1261600\">dormantlemon</a> <br>Models<br>Textures<br>Some area room<br>Check out his ze_bioshock map<br><br>- <a class=\"MemberLink \" href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/787083\">ballzofsteel</a> <br> A lot of hammer help and idea<br>Some models-brush work from his bhop_depot<br>Needed also a noob to try the map.<br><br>- <a class=\"MemberLink \" href=\"http://gamebanana.com/members/1317591\">Ntag</a> <br>You don't know what to do??
