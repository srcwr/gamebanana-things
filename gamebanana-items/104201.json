	"_sText": "I started doing this map in the ends of june, while I was learning how to map properly, with the idea of doing a good de_map for 5on5 matches very detailed with some nice covering spots.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I've been unable to test it for my self so I'm releasing this beta so I can have some feedback and improve the gameplay and some minor bugs I have noticed.\r\n\r\nI have optimized the map as much as I can and also reduced the lightmapscales and used the less amount of cubemaps I was able to but the filesize is still big, 45mb. Anyway if you use bz2 in your servers I think there wont be any problem at all."
