	"_sText": "INTRODUCING LEGO COMPOUND!\r\n\r\nlego compound is a fun, fast paced gun game map that provides a lot of different possible conflict points. Every part of the map is accessible. You can get on the roof by climbing the ladders above the windows on the red floor. It should be just large enough to provide a quick match but also one that is not a repeat of the same tactic every single round. I am interested in all feedback be it good or bad. i hope you all have fun playing it! :)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Boharox. he was the one who made the custom lego textures ^_^"
