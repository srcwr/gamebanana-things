Also the abstract map pack (http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/23695) was coming up for the joe.to community, so I figured this would be the perfect occasion.\r\n\r\nThe map is called de_shevat_ka, named after the same town in xenogears. They're even a couple songs from the game in the map.\r\n\r\nAnd originally I didn't set out to make a KA map, but this is the way it turned out. And it's not all that bad as there are two bomb sites that keep the action from just being runing around knifing.\r\n\r\nAnywho, here are some shots.\""
