	"_sText": "This is my third Azdu map which are maps based on Aztec and Dust themes and textures.\r\nThis time I wanted to create a smaller map and to have alot more displacment compaired to my previous map.\r\n\r\nAs you can see its set in a dust like world with ancient architecture designs, its a mix of old stone, fire and water.\r\nI like to create maps where it would be fun to play for all players, I dont like to make it too hard for the zombies to get the CT's so I have tryed to add multiple ways for CT's to defend and zombies to attack.\r\n\r\nI see with alot of big maps it can get really boring as you can be so far away from the action, the maps is pretty small with quite large open areas.\r\n\r\nI think its pretty much complete, I like to do maps that only need a v1, there is one or two texture that needed resizing but it was too late and the compile took quite a wile on my pc.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy."
