Then CTs have to cross the map (be carefull to the wind, it pushs you over the map :p) and to enter in the castle. T starts in this castle and fire CT with cannon :) \r\nThe spawn is random, CT have 0.5 probability to start in the castle or in the labo and vice versa for the T.\r\n\r\nI put some secret areas in the castle, secret button will open secret doors :p\r\n\r\nTo play in this map you should put the gravity to 400 ! (sv_gravity 400)\r\n\r\nEDIT : DEMO HERE => http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8_k5aJozX8"
