All credits go to him of course ...\r\n\r\nThis map isn't intended to be perfect from a way of textures and models, because I wanted to keep it oldschool with as least possible changes ... Although, I couldn't resist, so I added few new things ... :D\r\n\r\nthis video shows the new secret area: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAB0atz8HQA\r\n\r\nthe password is 2805+ to unlock room with guns with trails ... :)\r\n"
