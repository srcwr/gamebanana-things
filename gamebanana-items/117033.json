	"_sText": "Hey, I have not submitted a map in over 2 years. I kind of got out of the habit as I had school and got a job, I started to map for DOD:S but I was no good at that - DOD:S being a different style and the game play is a lot to compensate for. Good'ol CS:S, death map maps look better IMO and are easier to make. IMO :P\r\n\r\nI pretty much just revamped blood-strike, I think blood-strike maps get to the point, rounds go quick and lots of bloody battles!!!\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nP.S - I used Gary's mod to make the pictures, I did not touch them with Photo-Shop or a similar program.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I was wondering, can someone try this on a server with 32 players and tell me how it does, on my computer 32 bots doesn't run too well, but I want to make sure if it is okay online."
