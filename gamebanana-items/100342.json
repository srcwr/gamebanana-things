	"_sText": "\r\n\"I finally got this one finished. A lot of work and a lot of detail, so it may run a bit slow. I was paid to do it by some people who owned an internet cafe, and they were pretty picky on the details. They want to do tournaments on it. It is a map of a real place. Everything is to scale down to the inch, except for a couple doorways that had to be wider so people could go through them. However, some creativity was used in the sewer and rooftop areas. It's big with all it's custom textures. Their is no objective, just kill the other team. CTs start in the front of the Internet Cafe, and the Ts start in the back. It's been play tested and is very balanced on sides.\r\n\r\nDon't be afraid to use night vision, this map was built for it.\""
