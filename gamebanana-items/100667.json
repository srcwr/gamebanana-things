	"_sText": "I love the way the map looks, but unfortunately in terms of playability it's a somewhat weak map: There's really only one or two paths that you can take to get to the hostages, so it's very predictable, and there are some areas of the map that look really cool, but have no practical use. \r\n\r\nNote: This map has a few glitches. I'd fix them, but I lost the original source file I used to make the level. Specifically, there is one door to the parking garage that I accidentally set to have a low visibility distance, and if you get far enough away, the door disappears, allowing you to see what's behind it. \r\n"
