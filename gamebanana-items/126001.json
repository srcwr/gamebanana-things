Original map:&nbsp;<span>http://csgo.gamebanana.com/maps/188200</span></p><p>Around 25 seconds on auto, simple map and enjoyable if you prefer the straight speedrun type of map. I've ported longer maps in the past but this one is just short and sweet.</p><p>All credit goes to CaptainR3spawn.</p><p>Edit: At the original mappers request I have renamed the .bsp and updated the archive. Those of you who had downloaded the map prior to this will need to re-download/rename map on your server.</p>"
