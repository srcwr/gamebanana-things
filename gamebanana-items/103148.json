Now, when I have made it done, I'd like to share it with you :-) Of course there will be some bugs, so just write a comment. \r\n\r\n- Upcoming Version.\r\n1. optimization.\r\n\r\n- Whats new?\r\n1. A 3D Skybox.\r\n2. Models at the small farms. (Cows, Chickens, Pigs)\r\n3. Some better details.\r\n4. New and better pictures\r\n\r\n- Don't know how to install? Follow these steps:\r\nDownload the map by pressing the Download button\r\nGo to: YourSteamDir\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Counter-Strike Source\\cstrike\\maps and then just put the .bsp file in there.\r\nIf you want this map for a server, I would suggest to Bzip it. The download will be much faster, when the file is Bzipped. When you put the .bsp.bz2 file on your server, remember the .bsp file too, else it won't work. The Bzipper can be downloaded here: http://css.gamebanana.com/tools/1495\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map, please rate and leave a comment."
