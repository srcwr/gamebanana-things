	"_sText": "Hiho,\r\nthis is my first \"real\" bhop map, including mpbhop and its not fullbright like many other maps are ^^. Because this is my first map it has shitty textures, but i hope you will like it without awesome textures. Difficulty is hard, you have good chances to finish if you can get 500+ velocity easily. I made this on my own and did not steal any content from other maps. Please review and rate, would help me if you leave a commend where you can say what i can make better, because im just planning to make a better and longer map. That's all, have fun.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks To: \r\nsANDER^: Testing\r\nan00biz: Giving advise on how to optimize the map\r\nPizzaBoy: Testing\r\n "
