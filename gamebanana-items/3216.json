	"_sText": "Yes this is another automatic door prefab, however this is a fully working version, that does not lag, cause errors or give any adverse affects. The prefab has been taken from my map cs_bank (work in progress). It is intended like with my Rotating door to be used in office, or retail environments, however the concept is not new.\r\n\r\nThe prefab contains 2 fully working automatic doors that are operated when the player enters the trigger area. When the player leaves the opposite area the door closes. Feel free to add/change anything to this prefab as long as credit is given.\r\n\r\nAlso like I said with the rotating door, its good to have a little variety.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSmJe"
