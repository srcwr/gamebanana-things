Yay!\r\n\r\nThe 2 Terrorists must shoot blocks from there cannons at the platforms with the CT's on. After 60 sections the T's must run up a ramp whilst the CT's shoot them in an epic battle!\r\n\r\nThe cannons make the blocks totally random as they are both player controlled. I set it at 60 secsonds because experience players with cannons will be able to knock down all the blocks with a bit of luck ;)\r\n\r\nNOTE: PLEASE DO NOT DECOMPILE AND USE ITEMS FROM THIS MAP. Also I will be posting the cannon prefab later on today for anyone wanting to use it.\r\n\r\nAlso My Smash Cannon Prefab Can Be Found Here: http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3354\r\n\r\nHave Fun!"
