I build it one day six months ago in an attempt to learn a friend how to build maps with curved brush work.\r\nI never thought about releasing this map when i build it so I didn´t spend much time at details.\r\n\r\nWhen I was done with my teaching I thought that it was wasted work if I trashed it. So I spend additional ten min´ and added some ladders and spawnpoints.\r\nI called some friends and we played some gungame on it, it was realy fun.\r\nThey liked the map and wanted me to upload it on banana. But I though that it wasn´t worth it.\r\n\r\nNow six months later, they still want me to upload it.\r\n\r\nI said : Ok i do it , but I think I want to change the texture theme first. \r\n\r\nSo I loaded it up in hammer and changed all textures so i got a aztek/stone look at the whole thing.  I also added some paths on the ground and some mild fog to make it harder to spot people on the other side of the map.\r\n\r\nAnd aim_cirkular_aztek was born.\r\n\r\nIt´s cool what a couple of new textures can do to a map.\r\n\r\nThat is also why I uploaded both versions, so you got the ability to compare them with each other.\r\n\r\nok blabla...blabl.. |end of the Story|\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>|General map features| \r\n  </b>(same on both maps)\r\n\r\nSpawnpoints: 16\r\nBuyzone: yes, at spawn\r\nSun: yes\r\nNav-file: yes in the rar.file\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>|final notes|\r\n</b>\r\n |This two maps are most fun to play on a gg servers // Tip\r\n | Have fun and keep playing!\r\n \r\n/Alex\r\n\r\n<i> If I choose to spend more time at this map, it would probably be a second \"theme\" change. So if you have any texture/theme suggestions feel free to post </i>"
