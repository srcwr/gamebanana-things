	"_sText": "<hr /><b>Details:</b><br />\r\nThis is my remake of the unlockable Halo 2 map, Foundation. It has some cool features, the grav lifts for example that both look and work like the originals, and it is overall very accurate to the original. Please check it out and post your thoughts!\r\n\r\nA quick note about the grav lifts; if you just walk into them it will take a second to get pushed, what you want to do is jump into it.\r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b><br />\r\n40 spawns, full buyzones, grav lifts, custom <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/textures/1966\">Miramar</a> skybox texture, and a few other custom textures. I also included my <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/3131\">Fusion Cores</a>.\r\n\r\n<br />Please visit <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/studios/2377\">Clan 5k3's studio</a> for more Halo css maps and materials."
