Then he can use an unique slay method (at least i hope that its unique ^^).\r\n\r\nThe other jail, where people get into when they fail the map, has been made by Ryan S. Thank you very much for that ;)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I want to thank Surf-Velocity because Wirelezz hosted the beta-tests on their server.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's Miggo's vid of the map (watch in HD!): \r\n<object width=\"280\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/e9yQQagADeg&hl=de&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/e9yQQagADeg&hl=de&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"280\"></embed></object>\r\nThanks Miggo :D\r\nYou can find another vid by copy-mark on youtube, too. :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nPS: Decompile protected, thanks to Spoz! If you want to know anything about the vmf, contact me."
