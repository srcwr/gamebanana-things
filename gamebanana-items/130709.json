I wanted to give out a little Christmas gift for everyone, so I shrived to get the gameplay to be flawless. Thanks a bunch to everyone who was involved in its creation.\r\n\r\nI've made the following video to show to everyone what this new version is all about, as in my opinion, it's a whole lot better than the original ze_echo_escape. The video is lengthy, as it shows every possible way into the complex, but you can skip around if you'd like. Either way, I HIGHLY recommend you watch some of it before you comment or review the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n<embed width=\"448\" height=\"361\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" src=\"http://i211.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid211.photobucket.com/albums/bb195/Grey-Echo/snowescapevideo.flv\"></embed>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy!\r\nComments, stamps, and assessments are always welcome.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nÂ£cho\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative"
