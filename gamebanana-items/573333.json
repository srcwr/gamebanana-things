	"_sText": "Baulk is a map i made on CS 1.6. It features a unique layout, starting CTs and Ts right next to each other and leading them to the bombsites using parallel routes. After getting harassed by the CS 1.6 community and the chronic problems that came with the map's design, i have decided to start over on Source. This version of the map is practically a sketch of what i am after, it is NOT suitable for fair gameplay and contains multiple unfinished locations and lacks cover. This is merely a test platform made to experiment on the layout.<br><br>Baulk on GoldSource: <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/495598\" class=\"SelectedElement\">https://gamebanana.com/mods/57333<br></a>Baulk Source Updates Webpage: <a href=\"https://defusination.neocities.org/creations/baulks\">https://defusination.neocities.org/creations/baulks</a><br>"
