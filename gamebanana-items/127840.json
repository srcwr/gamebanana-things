The government wanted to build an oil rig in our own backyards and intended to kicks us out. Fortunately the Supreme Court overruled and decided not to. Government officials were not happy. We figured they’re after the oil, and want to waste us, so grab your guns, and any explosives you have. Not sure who’s attacking us, but they want our town, defend it at all costs.\r\n\r\nCT’s\r\n\r\nObjective: Take out the civilians as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nBrief: A small town in Texas is giving us a bit of trouble, we found oil, but the Supreme Court overruled its extraction, too many folks would be homeless. We are going to fix that problem. I’ve collected the best in the military for the job; you have all been trained in special ops and stealth, so I expect perfection. You’ll have limited ammo, KM .45 Tactical (USP), two smoke and flash grenades, and your average combat knife. A new suit has arrived and you boys will test driving it, you’ll be stronger and able to jump higher. This should be a piece of cake, good luck, and God speed!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHINT: CT's health will only regenerate if it gets below 100.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUPDATES:\r\n\r\n- Made CT's health regenerate faster.\r\n- Made CT's spawn with 300 hp.\r\n- Added alot of guns.\r\n- Fixed some small holes and glitches.\r\n- Optimized the map a little bit more.\r\n- CT's spawn with p228s instead of usps.\r\n- Enabled flashlights.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
