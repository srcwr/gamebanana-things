Each person gets a shotgun and gets a speed boost from each car. Go around driving and shooting people in the mini city.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 hidden cars and 4 smoke grenades around the map that give you extra speed and also increase the speed that you walk.\r\n\r\nMap made by MiniGames Community Studio!\r\n\r\nThere are a few map secrets; theres 1 hidden button for each door for the orange mustangs. Also theres a series of 3 buttons that must be pressed in order to break the gate near the smokes.\r\n\r\nThanks Paul_Deagle (aka [SG] Paul)"
