However, I started fiddling around with it again and managed to solve some issues I was uncapable of fixing at that time. I present to you the first beta of my remake of -KLM's old cs_sauna.\r\n\r\nAs there's alot of other half-assed ports of the original map over to the Source engine, I've been wondering about changing the name of this map. Let me know if you have some ideas.\r\n\r\nAll level design and custom textures was created by me.\r\n"
