Every round is different and both sides can win, \r\ndepending on the route that the team chooses to take.\r\n\r\nBasically this is just an experimental map which i decited to share. I played too much wolf 3d at the other day and got too much influence from it. Map is large'ish but quick to dowload and has enough spawnpoints. Have fun."
