	"_sText": "Just a random palm tree and Christmas tree I decided to make for those of you that don't feel like making your own. I know it looks extremely simple but the Christmas tree took nearly 200 brushes to complete >_< The screen shot is a wee bit inaccurate because I did some editing with lining up the brushes after I took that. Again, just a random creation of mine that I couldn't put to use so I released to help others, you don't need to rate or anything if you don't feel like it, just enjoy, The Christmas tree is good for those of you that would like to make a Christmas map but don't have anywhere to get a tree. Lol."
