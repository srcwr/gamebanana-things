I found it buried under all my other unfinished maps and decided to get this one done. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center area is a windtunnel that pushes players up into the air. There are 3 floors. CTs start at the top floor. Ts start at the bottom. Hell breaks loose in the middle.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpawn camping/killing is prevented by a one-way door that cant be fired through from either side.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you guys have fun with this map. I had fun making it."
