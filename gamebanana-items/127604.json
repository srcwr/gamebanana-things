At the same time, the speed of players is slightly reduced.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Player models have been replaced with heavily armored special forces/terrorists (built into the map).</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The goal of the terrorists is to blow up the bridge, and the special forces are to prevent this from happening.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Players can face the enemy on the bridge, hiding behind cover in the form of abandoned cars, buses, armored vehicles and downed helicopters. Or they can go under it, using the service passages, under the bridge.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">In addition, each team has tactical tools (the main feature of the map):</div><br><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Air-to-ground system drone, for the CT team:</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The drone flies high in the sky, around the bridge along a given route. It can be used both to determine enemy positions and to destroy them.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The player has the ability to control the camera from the perspective of a drone and fire missiles at opponents.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Heavy machine gun for the CT team:</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The machine gun is mounted in the window of the bus, located opposite the bomb site.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The machine gun can be controlled. It does a lot more damage, but has a limited field of view and is slow to turn.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Tactical shield for the CT team:</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The shield has a chance to block bullets, or simply reduce the damage from them.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Grenade launcher for team T:</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The rocket can track mouse movements and change direction accordingly. The rocket explodes when you press the RMB, or after ~2 seconds on its own.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">There is a limit of 20 shots.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Unmanned drone for T:</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">The ability to remotely control a drone on its behalf. When approaching close to the CT, the drone explodes.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">Can be destroyed with shots.</div><div class=\"tlid-transliteration-content transliteration-content truncated\">In addition to all this, each team has an AWP sniper rifle hidden at the top, with one clip.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>"
