	"_sText": "Second map I deem worthy of release, didn't spend much time on this one, but it plays well, is 100% even, has some nice light, and is highly optimized(260-160 FPS), was made with a underground arena in mind, sort of like a private underground club, remade especially for CSS. Think fight club.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at a aim map, so give me some tips on improving all you aim players!\r\n\r\nCan support 64 players, made by CaiD/Cook me DinnaH!\r\n\r\nGive me tips on what to add to this map, and feedback too please.\r\n\r\nThanks."
