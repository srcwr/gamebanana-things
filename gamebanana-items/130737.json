The map now also features high and smooth framerates.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n**Originality\r\nFrom original idea traps to riding a big truck on the road to hitching a ride on a modern train to firing a nuclear missile, this map will definitely entertain you.\r\n\r\n**Storyline\r\nNot just another senseless escape map where you escape out of nowhere to nowhere.\r\n\r\n**More than 64 x 2 spawn spots\r\nYou will definately get to play on the map even on a fully populated server. \r\n\r\nA secret laboratory in a mountainous area has been researching on the zombie species for the past decades. One day, one of the most toxic viruses on one of the zombie specimens, zombochloroflorine, got into the bodies of some scientists at the laboratory and infected them. Your colleagues and you have managed to gather at the emergency exit of the facility, and now have to flee to nearest train station and hitch a ride out of the area, or be converted into a mindless zombie.\r\n\r\n*Notes- First door needs a lot of teamwork to break as they have 2000 hp.\r\n\r\nMap By: FW -=LightningZLaser=-\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to: *-=Leb=-, FW -=ANBU=- (GoPinoY) and FW -=iSETHEN=- for ideas\r\n\r\nTexture Credits: karatekafer (Skybox)\r\nPrefab Credits: Creat_1 (Boat)\r\n\r\n==========www.FireWaLLCS.net/forums=========="
