	"_sText": "FYI, this map won't actually crash your server. I just thought the name would be kinda funny to have.\r\n\r\nThis map consists of a total of 4 texures. Green, black, white and a ladder texture. The green, black, and white textures are all custom made textures but the ladder texture is one provided by sourceSDK. \r\n\r\nThis map is meant to confuse, annoy, and mess with people's minds. Because of the repetitive colors of black and white, it can really throw you off track where you are keeping a good sense of direction is near impossible. And on top of that I inluded 2 death pits and a bomb site. The death pits can be acessed by climbing a ladder into them or simply jumping into them. Once you are in it you will be teleported extremely high above the map and fall to your death. It is really very funny watching people do this because they hit so hard they often times bounce off the ground. Also with the addition of the bomb site, if you go into the death pit at the right time right as the bomb is about to explode, you'll be throw throughout the map.  but overall, the gameplay is good in this map.\r\n\r\nThis map has 40 spawn points, buy zones for each team and a bunch of other crap in it. Try it out and leave me an assessment."
