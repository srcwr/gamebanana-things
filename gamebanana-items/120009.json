A bunch of different ways to play this map, its cool for knife fights as well as normal games. its also got a box in each spawn zone with 3 M421s and 8 grenades.  have fun and dont run by the pool\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI have to do a bunch of maps for a college project and they have to be commisioned for free and im not charging, so if you have a map request for your clan or something i can make you something.\r\n\r\nyou can add me on steam: katteneleger"
