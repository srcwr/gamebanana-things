	"_sText": "I have been working on this map on and off for a couple of months now, and I finished it up several days ago.  I was going to wait for GunGame version 4 to be released and create custom DM spawn points for it to be included, but I decided to go ahead an release it now and I will add the custom spawn points at a later time.  This map has all custom content embedded in the bsp, and includes a radar overview as well as HDR and a 3D skybox.  The bsp is rather large at 32.4 MBs uncompressed, so I recommend that you have fast download setup on your server for this map.  The map size itself is also rather large, so it plays better with more players.  I have been asked by someone who play tested it to make a smaller version using similar layout but cutting off some of the outer areas and I may do that for smaller servers.  \r\n\r\nEdit:  August 26, 2007.  I have added gg_intersect_non_hdr which is identical except that it was compiled without hdr so the file size is less than half that of the original.  This will hopefully help those with a more limited amount of bandwidth.  "
