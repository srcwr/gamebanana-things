Figured I should put it on fpsbanana.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the .txt:\r\n\r\n***********************************\r\nxmas_apehouse_s\r\n\r\nMade by HomicidalApe.\r\n\r\nemail: dantoumey@gmail.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.homicidalape.mybigspoon.com/mapsite\r\n***********************************\r\n\r\n\tA family living in a house in the winter on december 25th suddenly up and left with all the doors unlocked. A bunch of terrorists decided to go in the house and plant a bomb next to a tree that is in their living room for some reason. Counter-Terrorists are only coming to the house because they heard it was empty and they wanted to party in it. Forces collide.\r\n\r\nTerrorsits: Plant the bomb under the tree that is decorated for some reason and in the living room.\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorist: Try to party it up without getting killed by terrorists. Killing the terrorists is ok, but if they all die the round starts over and you can't party in the house. Plus if they plant the bomb then your party time will run out, try to not let them plant it. Use arguement and reason, not force.\r\n\r\nHINT: There's a ladder to the roof of the house somewhere!"
