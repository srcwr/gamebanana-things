Jailbreak in 2008 but since it was outdated as a jailbreak map I decided to remake it and this is what I came up with. Very similar to the original with the same games and cell design.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\nThe map has\r\n\r\n\r\n- 8 CT slots\r\n\r\n- 52 T slots\r\n\r\n- 2 T's per cell\r\n\r\n- 1 random gun spawner in cells\r\n\r\n- Random gun spawns around the map so every round is different\r\n\r\n- Cafeteria\r\n\r\n- Football Pitch\r\n\r\n- Running Track\r\n\r\n- Secret hole in the wall so T's can escape\r\n\r\n- Sniper Towers"
