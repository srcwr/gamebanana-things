The Black spots are supposed to be crates but they never showed up in game so it creates a kind of wallhacks type wall which would look pretty neat and some houses that are good for sniping out of. If you think i should add anything else to the map just tell me and i'll fix it the way you all want. Thanks and Have Fun as i have in this map. If you want to check out the map in game come here its going to always be played 72.36.157.109:27015"
