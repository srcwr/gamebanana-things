	"_sText": "A simple map. I'm experimenting with low gravity gameplay. With low gravity both humans and zombies have a big advantage. I'll try to make a map with sort of low gravity jumping complex.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is jumping around and try to survive, or preventing zombies from entering a platform. I'll try to make a map with sort of low gravity jumping complex.\r\n\r\nI need to see how this map works on other servers with different knockback, so I can improve the balance. Currently it might be a bit few enterances for the highest platform.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, improvements or gameplay ideas would be great.\r\n\r\n--- UPDATE ---\r\n- Improved brightness.\r\n- I need to redesign the layout because it's a bit laggy with 25+ players. \r\n- If anyone have more ideas for low gravity gameplay I would like to know. :)\r\n\r\nMade by: Richard Helgeby (Norway)"
