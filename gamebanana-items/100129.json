	"_sText": "<b>CS_MEATLIGHT</b> by Chris (released November 2008)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Back in 2004, when <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/8581\">cs_twilight</a> was released, it was quite a success. Several months later, a CSS update replaced ragdoll models and all the old ones were removed. This replacement resulted in an big ERROR message in the map.<br><br>CS_MEATLIGHT is a great remake of this fast action, ultra violent map. Chris has made some layout modifications and added a passage through the ventilation system but he kept the spirit of its famous ancestor intact.<br><br>The graphic part was also updated to today standard. Numerous custom textures are used and give an original look to this office map.<br><br>There are 32 spawn points but it is very enjoyable (and less bloody chaotic) with 8 to 10 players only. A perfect little map for big and perfect frags!<br><br>- from map review at <a href=\"http://netday.be\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">Netday.be</a>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Great Thanks to Chris for this Great Remake!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>About Playing with Bots: Here is a manually optimized (hand-tuned) and fully place painted <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/gamefiles/3296\">NAV-file</a> (Navigation Mesh for playing against the Bots) for this map, because the embedded in .bsp original author's NAV is not fully playable slightly edited auto-gen (in particular bots don't use a ladder between the street and a balcony of office, also don't use a ventilating course from the street deadlock to a corridor of the second floor). Now bots have opportunity to use ALL walkable ways and surely move on ALL space of the map! :-)"
