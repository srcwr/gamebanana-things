	"_sText": "Well this is the new version of this map. There are a few secret rooms if you can find them. There is also 3 working elevators and a back stairway in case the security lockout is engaged. Also for the elevators, up is \"s\" and down is \"w\".\r\n\r\nAlso, by request, you can get on the roof of the courtyard and the secret room with the monitors isn't as cheap anymore. 2 ways to get into that area. Also the elevator shafts are fixed along with the vents. There are now boxes to get up if security is enabled.\r\n\r\nAnother update is the lighting. The street lights are updated, more realistic with the lighting. More rooms/ updates to come.\r\n\r\nBTW nav file may need to recompile itself if you are using bots.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n"
