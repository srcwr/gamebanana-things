After many versions and bugfixes here comes the final one. It also has buyzones - so it can be used for other small servers, too. Also: a new tunnel and a teleport spawn from t to ct spanpoint at the doors.\r\nYou can try it on our: <a href=http://tomb.deltaforceteam.de/phgstats/index.php?sh_srv=2 target=_blank>GUNGAME SERVER</a> - its in the mapcycle ^^\r\n\r\nIts one of Rikkus first mapworks, so please be nice to her work :-)\r\n\r\n<b><u>Infos from Rikku:</b></u>\r\nrebell_dust_mini for Counter-Strike: Source - 30.01.2007\r\nChange by Rikku2000 with help from [amz|Mc$core]\r\nOriginal Map by Valve!\r\n\r\n<b><u>Installation Notes:</b></u>\r\nExtract the files to the cstrike directory.
