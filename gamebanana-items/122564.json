Just hope there is more teammates than enemies!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Try to make your own strategies, for both teams and you most likely handle this map well, but just remember to watch out for enemy rushers, campers, backtabbers, snipers etc..\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now download this map and kill those b*stards!"
