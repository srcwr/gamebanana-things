But never released to public.\r\nDays ago i was bored and updated this map to next version. \r\nAdded some new ways,vents and strange places in map.\r\nPlayer slots 72 (Its not for that much, but better more than less).\r\nMap contains an outdoor cliff area with a base inside.\r\nI couldnt manage good map overview, so its missing some ways. Look for 6th screen for a under view of map.\r\n\r\nFuture episodes: when i get bored again =). \r\nI cant say if i even make them. Probably will be connected to ways which are closed now.\r\n\r\nA bit history: Looks like some places is infested by unknown bio-materia. Terrorists trying to prevent that by destroying a base. I wonder what is that black cube outside, but i hear that no one come back from it. There is rumor - some one alive inside a base. I also noticed, that time has stoped in some places or no?\r\nWhat happened here?! Who knows.. Maybe its a dude with a case.. Again.\r\n\r\nMy english isnt primary language, sry."
