They are provided weapons (CT = M4a1, Deagle, HEGrenade ; T = AK47, Deagle, HEGrenade) There is one AWP on the map which is located smack dab in the middle.\r\n\r\nAs for the other players in the map, they sit at the top of the map and watch as the two battle it out. Which ever one survives uses the awp to kill the 7 remaining players in the \"Stands\" of the enemies side. Round restarts and new players are picked.\r\n\r\nThe objective : To elimate the other player and his team.\r\n\r\nRespawn Points : 16 (8 CT's ; 8 T's)\r\n\r\nWeapons on map : 7 (x1 M4a1 ; x1 AK47 ; x2 Deagle ; x2 HEGrenade ; x1 AWP)\r\n\r\nThis is the final version of the map. \r\nDo not tell me the water is messed up, it is like that intentionaly.\r\n\r\n"
