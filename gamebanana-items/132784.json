	"_sText": "A small but fun zombie mod map, that requires basic jumping and parkour skills. Fun to play with any number of players. If you fall, <del>you die</del>. Actually, you get teleported over to the small water pool, to prevent falling damage. However, players may get stuck to one another and&nbsp;!noblock may be required. Some areas are quite dark due to the sun orientation, however the entire skybox&nbsp;could change in the future. I hope you like the WinterPlanet sky. Credit for that goes to gleb_erilov. There's also a teleporter that takes you to another section of the map, which has no hiding spots. Just look for the green doors. On that section you'll typically have to rely on teamwork and your guns to keep safe. The map has a lot of custom textures, but they're packrated. No worries. :) I hope ya enjoy."
