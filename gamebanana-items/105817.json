The objects are placed tactically so you can use it to your advantage. Both sides are exact mirrored. This is a texture map.\r\nI made this map to a design I quickly came up with and after toying around a bit it has worked out quite well.\r\n\r\n<b>Objective:</b>\r\nFight your way through this symmetrical fortress and neutralize the threat that lies on the other side...\r\n</center>"
