	"_sText": "This map is a remake of my all time favorite map from a long time ago. It was called fy_pool_day2 and it was for counter-strike. I have not played on the original map in several years. I made this version using only my memory and a few screenshots. This is a somewhat fast paced shoot-em-up with some places to hide. There is however a bombsite at the top of the highdive. It also has an underwater passage way to both spawn areas. Just a nice little map for some clean fun. Can't you just feel that cool refreashing water hitting your face? :)"
