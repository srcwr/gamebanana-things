	"_sText": "This is my first map iÂ´ve ever made in my life for Counter Strike: Source. Is a remake of the known map for Counter Strike 1.6. \r\n\r\nBoth Terrorists and Counter Terrorists have to pick up gun from the ground. Terrorists have in their side Ak 47 and Counter Terrorists have M4A1 in their side. Also, there are 4 AWP in the map and some grenades in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe size of the map is small and teams are facing each other.\r\n\r\nPlease, this is my first time, i need good feedback to improve my skills. \r\n\r\nHope you like it!"
