It is run by Tama Riyadi, a crime lord, who is the target of the task force. While detaining various tenants of the apartment, the team eventually detains a man who is delivering medicine to his sick wife in room 726. However, before the team enters the apartment, he escapes. The team infiltrates the apartment block floor by floor until they reach the sixth floor. However, the team is seen by a young lookout, who raises the alarm before he is shot and killed.\r\n\r\nMap Have custom texture end song of film"
