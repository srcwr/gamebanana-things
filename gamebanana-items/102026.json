Every time I had the same thoughts: \r\n\r\nLoveless, Angularly and not up to date!\r\n\r\nThus I took a heart and decided to give the Map a new form. \r\n\r\nIn the past I noticed that \"playing community\" ,is too unflexible giving\r\nnew Maps a chance. Fact is the best known and most popular Map on Public-Severn is \"de_dust2\". \r\n\r\nThe intention was to built a Map which can totally substitute the original map, \r\nwithout players must adapt themselves! \r\n\r\nThe following aspects were the initial position to start:\r\n\r\n- no new ways, doors or game-relevant Props \r\n- identical play expiry (thatÂ´s the reason for de_dust2 beeing the most popular Map) \r\n- the Map must also run on low level systems (no texture orgies) etc. etc. \r\n\r\nNow after some months the Map has reached the FINAL status. \r\n\r\n\r\nName: de_dust2_remake_final\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Map is fully playable and concluded so far. \r\n\r\nMy Objective is to shame the original de_dust2! \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks already to my Wingman Stubu, which spend a lot of time with testing the project. \r\n\r\n\r\nYours \r\n\r\nBlade \r\n\r\n\r\ncontact: blade@rumpelbumpel.de \r\n\r\n\r\n"
