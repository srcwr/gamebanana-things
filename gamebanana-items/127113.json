Trap for mor Fps\r\nOverall FPS increasd\r\nLowered some attacks from dragon\r\n\r\nHello guys this is my new release. Map is still in beta maybe there are bugs. If you found some plz report\r\n\r\nHere video preview \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9SSfA7vqdU\r\n\r\nMap Contains:\r\n\r\nPokemons\r\n18 Traps\r\n4 Minigames\r\n1 epic Boss\r\n48 Ct Spawns\r\n3 T spawns\r\nAfk killer\r\n3 Secret special nades with secret things\r\n\r\nand a fairness system:\r\nthere are shortcuts to the end of the level at choosen positions. If more than 3 Cts are playing,the 1. shortcut closes. If more than 7 Cts are playing, all shortcuts closes\r\n\r\nThis is made so that teams with 4 Cts have a chance to win because on other maps its impossible to beat a map with 3 or less Cts at beginning, resulting T giving free round that delayes the round because all have to run through the whole map"
