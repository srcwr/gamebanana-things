In movies, they sometimes hold a band, so for the sake of props, this could double as a stage in a park in GMod and with a bit of improved textures, SFM as well.\r\n\r\nAlso look up on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_and_the_Gazebo\">Erik and the Dread Gazebo</a>, the story in which a hapless D&D player encounters a gazebo in a park, but now knowing it isn't a monster; firing arrows at this bad boy won't scare it away, but it'll eat you if you try to run."
