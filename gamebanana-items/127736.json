Where it's about creating a map similar to mg_lego_builder created by Epic Jonny a.k.a Robin.</p>\r\n<p>I copied nothing from his .vmf in any way, i created everything from scratch by myself where i also added more features and additions to my liking.</p>\r\n<p>These features includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>64 player spawn</li>\r\n<li>randomized game modes</li>\r\n<li>free building</li>\r\n<li>5 different building roles</li>\r\n<li>20 avalible builder slots</li>\r\n<li>10 different building pieces</li>\r\n<li>5 different skins for each building piece</li>\r\n<li>total replay-ability</li>\r\n<li>randomized game perks (such as hp, speed, lowgrav)</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>randomized game events/suprises</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>APOCALYPSE MODE - meteors rain down while everything explodes, breaking all the pieces they touch, other modes and perks might or might not be mixed up, it's all a free-for-all random frenzy!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This was created over the course of about 4-5 days, along with some testing on the PlagueFest server.\r\nI hope it'll be some amusement for you all.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy!</p>"
