There are 22 spawns per team for best case scenario :)\r\n\r\nMap kinda forces you to look everywhere... and spawn camping dosen't work very well.\r\n\r\nThere are buyzones at team spawns, and one at the top (each secondary buyzone is looking to other team's primary one). But rushing to top and constantly buying granades will not work."
