One of them is a (poor)scoutzknivez remake, in which i am a bit ashamed of, lol. another is a map with a giant tower in the center (Dont fall off!). the third is an exact model of a map I made (dm_killbox_hg4) and it should be lots of fun (i hope) enjoy it, and if you find problems, email: wil_dahl@yahoo.com"
