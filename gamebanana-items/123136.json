	"_sText": "surf_this_njv (no jail version)\r\n\r\nThis version is made for surf timer and other similar addons. I will most likely make a jail and release a combat version. All the teleports in the map lead back to spawn. I left them in the map so people would see where they will be in the combat version. The map doesnt have a timer. Since this is all about the surf, I deleted all the details so that fps would be as high as possible. I have about 200-300 all through the map. \r\n\r\nComments/Critique concerning the surf is most welcome, but as I said, I'm well aware that details and jail are missing. \r\n\r\nSettings should be:\r\n-tickrate 66\r\nsv_airaccelerate 150\r\nsv_gravity 800\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UIUFZkwcXzI&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UIUFZkwcXzI&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"280\" height=\"170\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nThanks to the betatesters.\r\nI hope you like the map.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBrave."
