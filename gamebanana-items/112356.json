When falling down, make sure to hit the water :D.\r\nLot's of AMMO!!!\r\nMap should be played on strong machines because of performance issues.\r\nIt never really crashed, but you do feel the engine working hard on it :).\r\nNot for serious gaming, just FUN!\r\n\r\nIf this map get's some positive feedback, I might make some more.\r\n\r\nGreet's\r\n\r\nThe Dead Walk aka HOLY_BlackSkull (in the old old old days...) \r\n\r\nThanks to: reibekuchen and ThrillSkull for testing the map!"
