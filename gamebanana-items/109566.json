	"_sText": "Hi, First of all I hope you like my map.\r\n\r\nThis is exually the first map that i've post on FPSBANANA, and one of the few maps i've made so far. My Idea with this map was to create an Iraqi City, where you can go in all of the buildings and shoot/get shot from allmost all windows. You can olsow use the map for sniper fights but I like it more as an normal map where you have to clear the area. The textures are all standard, you can find them in de_dust and de_dust2 so allmost every one has them. The whole map is made by me, so is the nav file. That file took me about 4 hours to complete but is working good now. I alsow included a radar/overview but this one is not included in de BSP cause I didn't get bspzip to work. It is included in my .rar file but players can't download it when joining your server. \r\n\r\nHere are some screenshot of the build:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.xfire.com/screenshots/dakillerdick/\" target=\"_blank\">KLIK HERE</a>\r\n\r\nI hope that you enjoy playing my map.\r\nMr.ShotGun^nl"
