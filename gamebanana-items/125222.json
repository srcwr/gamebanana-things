(The other being an insanely hard bhop map)  This will hopefully be the first in a series of bhop maps that I might make using the same texturing scheme.\r\n\r\nAs said above, it's a relatively easy bhop map that should not take long to complete, and features:\r\n\r\n- Most blocks are 64x64 units\r\n- Some blocks are 32x32 units\r\n- Small Surf Ramp\r\n- Fan\r\n- Climb Bhop\r\n- Every stage is connected by a drop, NO teleporting to a different stage\r\n\r\n**The map and the textures were created by me.**"
