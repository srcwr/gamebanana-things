This isn't a copy, or anything. It's completely original, and Was created in about 5 Hours or so, including Game play and testing. This map does have a few.....errors. The lights are a little bright in certain places, but not unplayable. xD\r\n\r\nThe ladders work, and although a few places may look strange, it had to be done for them to not be effected by the ladders on the wall.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, of which I cannot figure out, BOTS do NOT use ladders, thus they are useless in this map.\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
