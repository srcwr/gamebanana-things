	"_sText": "Basically, the Ts are trying to destroy a castle and the CTs are trying to protect it.\r\n\r\nThe Ts can win by either killing all the CTs or by planting the bomb (there will be 2 bombs each round). The bomb can be planted at the top of the castle near all the barrels. The CTs can win by killing all the Ts.\r\n\r\nThe Ts can get through the wall by either climbing one of the ropes or by breaking the main door.\r\n\r\n****Ts****\r\n\r\nSpawn outside of castle and wall.\r\nHave 300 hp.\r\nHave mp5.\r\n\r\n****CTs****\r\n\r\nGet to choose one of 2 classes;   Archer or Warrior.\r\nStart at top of the castle\r\n\r\n.  **Class: Archer**\r\nGets 50 hp.\r\nGets Scout.\r\n\r\n.  **Class: Warrior**\r\nGets 150 hp.\r\nGets m3 (shotgun).\r\n\r\nThe CTs have 30 seconds to choose a class, if they don't choose in time, they will be killed.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf I have used one of your textures please leave a comment letting me know. The barrels at the top of the castle are from ze_lotr_helms_deep_v4_2.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the gameplay will be for this map. I will probably have to make a few changes for v2 to make the teams even. If you find any glitches, please let me know in the comments below. :)"
