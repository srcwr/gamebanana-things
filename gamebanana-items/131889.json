Check out the laser room, the jumping room, the breakable concrete room, the barricading room, and the obstacles built specifically for interesting gameplay.  \r\n\r\nTheme:  In the future we have harnessed the zombie mutation.  We take criminals or volunteers and put up to 50 into a controlled facility with many obstacles.  One is infected and then the humans and zombies fight to the death, all while being televised.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to anyone that helped with questions and the people who tested this."
