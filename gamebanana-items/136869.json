	"_sText": "This is the first map I have submitted here. It is not the greatest I know, but I'm just trying to learn new things.\r\n\r\nThis was originally supposed to be a 1v1 gungame tournament map, but I decided to put in some more spawn points and go at it on my PUB. The bots are pretty stupid in here, like bots usually are, sometimes they will get brave and try to dart across the map, usually resulting in a headshot from a human player!\r\n\r\nPlease leave me feedback about stuff that you like and would like to see more of in future maps, and also stuff you don't like. I am open to any suggestions anybody has, because I never have ideas for a map, and I HATE texture maps. The color orange is dead to me now because of texture maps!\r\n\r\nThank you all for DLoading my map and I hope you enjoy it. Be on the lookout for gg_interogation  I'm put the finishing touches on it and gonna take screenshots tonight and put it on here!\r\n\r\nC0rps3-x0r"
