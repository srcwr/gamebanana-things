Once you get the hang of it, <b>you can strafe, attack from the air, \r\nor drop behind the other team</b>. You do not have to jump or do anything \r\nspecial. Just walk or run into the cannons.<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDZKUcwLCgY\"><br></a><br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDZKUcwLCgY\">Click here if you want to see the cannon in action!&nbsp;</a><br><br><br>*The map looks dark due to a rendering error.
