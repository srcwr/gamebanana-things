	"_sText": "When I got the idea for this map, I wanted to give it a darker, foreboding feeling.  Using the darker colored 'dev' textures lent perfectly to this feel for the map.  The skybox is designed to be as simple as possible, yet seem very imposing.\n\n8 towers, all crenelated.  Paths at the top and midway points between all towers.  Ladders in the center of the towers for access.  The upper center section is designed to give cover while ascending the ramps."
