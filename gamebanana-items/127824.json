Cannons now kill on impact.\r\n\r\nThanks to Tomgreen for helping me find and fix a lot of bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Fixed**\r\nThanks to the update the cannon balls would not break the castles but no worries it's all been fixed and it has some added secrets to it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMade By:Slayer</center></b></Font size>"
