	"_sText": "This is a game concept that a couple of friends, including myself, created during our massive Metal Gear phase. We originally played this game using Airsoft guns and toy knives. The concept of this game is for the Snakes(CT's) to take out the guards(T's) without being noticed. The map includes multiple areas for stealthy encoucounters. The guards are provided with armor, primary and secondary weapons, and a grenade. The snakes are provided with a USP, nvg's, flashbangs, and smoke grenades. The idea is for the guards to protect the house using their flashlights to spot enemies, while the snakes are to infiltrate and neutralize.\r\n\r\nConstructive Criticism is appreciated for improvement of this map.\r\nThankyou.\r\n\r\nP.S. SvG means Snake versus Guard"
