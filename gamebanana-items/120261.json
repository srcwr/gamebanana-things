Or else its knifing time!\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nI will be realeasing a prefab to, So you mappers can add or modify it to place in your own maps. Also there will soon be a categorie CM (Cannon Mod) where all these kind of maps will be put in. So i hope to see lots of CM maps ^^\r\n\r\nThere were screens in the control rooms which were very handy controlling the artillery but i removed them because on the T screen it displayed the same as the CT screen, its a limitation of source. You can have to monitors in you map. BUT you cant have 2 cameras in your map! So unfortunately i know no other way making it easier to control. If you do send me a PM!!!!!\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n\r\nelevator doors are shit\r\nelevator is shit\r\nArtillery can move through itself\r\ncannisters sometimes explodes in the barrel\r\nand some more crappie bugs I couldn't fix!\r\n\r\n<h2>HAVE FUN<h2>"
