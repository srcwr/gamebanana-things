(No Starting Weapons)\r\n\r\nSo that it can be used in DM and such...\r\n\r\nThis map is made mainly to only use Awp but you can probably use it to more :P\r\n\r\nFeel free to remake it if you want...\r\n\r\nThere are a hidden room under the map... you can get to it by breaking the floor in the corner in the little house..."
