	"_sText": "This map uses the formula found in many hostage situations: Counter-Terrorists must assault, clear and rescue hostages in a large warehouse.\r\n\r\nDon't dismiss this map as just an assault clone, it is much more than that. The Counter-Terrorists start off on the street while the Terrorists start off in their facility. Just a short rush brings the CTs to a electric gate... which is suicide if the terrorists have any common sense. There are entrences in the back as well.\r\n\r\nOnce in the building the Counter-Terrorists have to clear three stories to reach the hostages. Due to the close quarters of this map, it seems to me that it would be very hard for a terrorist to sneak around and lay a trap in the hostage rescue point, but it can be done.\r\n\r\nThe map itself is well made, the time setting and atmostphere is great. The texture selection for the interior and exterior of the warehouse is excellent. The Exterior has that degraded, old look to it while the inside is clean and new, just what you would expect from a criminal organization's safehouse."
