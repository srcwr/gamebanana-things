	"_sText": "ORIGINAL TEXT:<br><br>This is my new map. So much people like mgraceparking and want a new race map. This new race is more big than mgraceparking. Player can't fight during the first race, if you hit a obstacle, you will be teleported in the jail with weapon (cut/gun/pm/rifle/...). This new version is call \"extended\" because the race is slighty longer than the first version. The jail has been improve and final jail-room get a button for restart the race. One more music was added (Just Jack - Basement) and there is the opportunity to play a round without music. Here is the list of the music : - Poperotik - B*tch plz - M83 - Midnight city - PSY - Gangnam Style - Just Jack - Basement Thanks to Crazy Gaming team. Note : The .rar contains the map and the .bak. is not necessary for play.<br><br>NOTE:<br>In this version of the map, the exploit doesn't exist where you can get out of the map. If you want the unfixed version of the map with the exploit, <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/590039\" class=\"SelectedElement\">go here</a>.<br><br>Ported from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/mods/80248\" target=\"_blank\">CS:GO</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004460078\" target=\"_blank\">permission granted</a>.<br>"
