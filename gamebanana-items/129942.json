I went for a slick look with not to much going on.\r\n\r\nMap Features\r\n\r\n    * 40 Spawns\r\n    * Summer Styled Cell, Spawn & Medic Area\r\n    * Climbing Area\r\n    * Playable Football Pitch with Regular & Penalty Shootout Mode\r\n    * Bulldog Arena\r\n    * Large Swimming Pool\r\n    * Bunnyhop Area\r\n    * Last Request Stable\r\n    * 2 Secrets\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIt was a beta for my communitys servers, but its here for others to see. Being a beta dont expect it to be bug free. Please report any bugs back asap.\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\nVersion 1\r\n\r\n- Bug Fixes\r\n- \"Man Cannon\""
