	"_sText": "Update: HDR and some cubemaps removed. This causes the map to look different now, those who have good computer and don't need 32 players should download the old version here (wich looks better, but is much larger to download) http://www.gamebanana.com/css/maps/155516\r\n\r\n****************\r\nWhat you get here, is a small map, which is created with a great amount of attention to graphical detail. This attention is, in part, expressed by very detailed brushwork, soundscapes, a 3D-skybox and, new in this release, HDR. The maps setting is, as the name suggests, some industrial estate which is laid out for a maximum of 20 players, while still creating an intense gaming experience for smaller amounts of players.\r\n\r\nThis is a 32 slot version on request, except of upgrading the slots I just did some minor changes, nothing to worry about."
