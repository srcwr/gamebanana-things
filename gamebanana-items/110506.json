	"_sText": "This a simple knife arena and I don't know where the idea came from. The field of tall grass in the center blocks most of your view while walking through it. You can just barely see other players heads. Use the walk way on the side to get above the tall grass and get a much better view at the players below. Then you can ambush your pray from above.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n20 Terrorist\r\n20 Counter-Terrorist\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nI most likely will make a v2 with some displacement and some water to give it a swampier feel. Also i am going to adjust the lighting to go along with the swampy feel."
