	"_sText": "All started last night when I could not sleep, got up and decided to use the PC, the day before I had downloaded the SDK kits to try at making a map. I figured lots out myself and got some tutorials also. Anyway here is my first ever map for Counter Stike: Source. Nothing amazing but I think its pretty good for a first try! Ill upload more screenshots when I can be bothered. Folder contains the .BSP file, cant find the .nav in my maps folder for some reason, ill have to sort that out I suppose. I think it may be a little small for a DE_ map but you guys tell me what you think.\r\n\r\nHappy new year."
