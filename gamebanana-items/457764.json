I haven't got anyone to playtest with yet.<br><br>A symetric 1v1 map with 4 spawns, so that yours and your opponent's spawns are random each round- ground floor or second floor. Players can either exit the building through the front door and get the grenade or get on the roof and try to get the awp on the plank connecting the buildings (the plank is breakable). There is also an SMG on the second floor.<br>Later I am planning to have an object around the grenade, to give more cover, making the skybox light to shine directly down (one house now has more shadows then the other), and a little pool of water outside of the houses for strategic jumps off the roof"
