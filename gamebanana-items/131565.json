	"_sText": "<font color=\"#2222FF\">I've made a few modifications, so the map should now work on servers running Linux.  Version 2 would crash Linux servers.  T_T\r\n\r\nThe map has a new room (seen in the first screenshot) connected to the barn room.  I also added a secret passage and a secret camping spot.  The television is disabled because it caused problems.  Maybe one day I'll learn how to make a good T.V.\r\n\r\nComments are appreciated!!\r\n\r\n*EDIT*\r\nMinor update 07/06/07\r\n-Fixed a door glitch\r\n-Improved FPS for the new areas of the map\r\n-Fixed the T.V. (YAY!!)\r\n-New name is zm_complication_v4a\r\nv4 is functional and pretty good, but doesn't have the same frame rates as v4a and the T.V. doesn't work.  Re-Download if you see fit.</font>"
