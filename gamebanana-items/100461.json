Windows are sealed off and snow is creeping in through the ventilation system and sneaking under the garage doors. \r\nPeople have been taken hostage and it's up to you to save them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I made this map but have finally gotten around to getting it to compile.\r\nI'm not going to update this map anymore so if there's something you think  needs changing, feel free to do so yourself by downloading the .vfm <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/mips/87\">here</a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvF_nxXJO5s&fmt=18\">.</a>\r\n\r\nThere's 32 spawn points \r\n<i>(Maybe 40. I should've checked before uploading this haha, no that's not funny.)</i> \r\nCustom nav made by myself, including place painting <i>(They're not shown in the screen shots because I made them after and didn't feel like re-taking the screen shots.)</i>\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map. \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/55178\">chizbone</a> for tuning the nav file."
