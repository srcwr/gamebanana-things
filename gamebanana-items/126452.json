I noticed that and took the liberty to make the map entirely possible, while removing some aspects of the original detail of the map, and adding extra blocks here and there. The map was made by \"nohomo\" on cosy-climbing.net, his profile can be found here.<br>https://cosy-climbing.net//user.php?id.13078<br><br>Tier 4/6, est completion time 2:00~<br><br>Enjoy (or don't)<br><br>"
