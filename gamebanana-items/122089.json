	"_sText": "Basically, this is a surf map that has a button that you may shoot or press to get your self out of jail, or if some one presses the kill button, you begin to freeze to death and it narrows your chances of getting out. This map has serveral weapons scattered on platforms, XL course, SL course and of course Awp, or the campers heaven. This map consists of many teleports AND THIS IS MY FIRST SURF MAP!! enjoy \r\n\r\nplease note it is still in beta, but it is most functional *use sv_airaccelerate 100* and also if you find any glitches or errors please tell me!!!!!!"
