It is named dm_ndu\r\n\r\nThis map IS Nacht Der Untoten\r\ni just got this game today downloaded a bunch of stuff and said huh ill try that. Now I have had experience with much more complicated softwares than this but I realllllly enjoyed making this map. Took me about 4 hours of planning and just messing around haha. Its 2 am on a school night so i ought to get going now. I hope the make der riese tomorrow but NO PROMISES :) i am a busy boy. If you have any questions or comments shoot me an email as I don't use this site much In fact I just signed up just now to post this map because I am really exited about it. I plan for there to be PVC but idk i think that entails writting source codes which I don't have time for. Although i do have good amount of time. tell me about any problems or suggestions so i can fix them. and has anyone else made this map before???/ anyways stay tuned for more."
