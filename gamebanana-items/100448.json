XD lol just give it a try, its a HUGE map i mean its big as hell itself. scary backround noise, fog, rain, all that good shit.\r\n\r\nHave fun! and please Host this map to the world! :D\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n  This map was created entirely by Sgt. Sickness, Since there was not a Counter strike source version of his awsome map, Thanks to him for his amazing map and UnknWn<-->SlaYeR for the CS:S conversion.\r\n\r\nI felt that the origional skybox was not dark enough, now I see that it is too dark. Expect a future version with better(denser) fog, and a better skybox.\r\n"
