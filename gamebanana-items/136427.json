	"_sText": "I updated the original map to get rid of some problems that had been noted.  I fixed the player clips so players can no longer get on the roofs of the surrounding buildings and then ultimately outside the map.  Also, I retextured many faces with nodraw to increase player FPS.  At the request of some, I only included in this version a standard lighting map and no HDR version. Thanks for downloading! nav file and buyzones included."
