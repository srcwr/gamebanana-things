Another great remake that deserved gameplay where the bots will use radio chatter properly ;)<br><br>You can get the map here: <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/53211\">MAP</a><br><br>The nav that came with the map is pretty good already, however there were a few places&nbsp;\"disconnected\" from the map. Vents were unaccessible by the bots and a whole portion of the map that starts in the underground tunnels and leads up to one of the hostage rooms was disconnected, too. I fixed those issues and place painted the map according to its CS 1.6 counterpart. The new locations in the source version that didn't exsist in the original I named as best as I could. I hope my imagination served me well.<br><br>Enjoy!"
