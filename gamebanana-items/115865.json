The principe is quite simple: no bombs, no hostages and a different gun at each round for the whole players (choice between deagle, shotgun, m4, and awp).\r\nIt's not a realistic map, so i decide to use Tags in a different way.\r\nAs I said, it is done rather quickly, therefore it is not very detailed nor very complicated, the ambition is also rather simple: funny games, and it is all.
