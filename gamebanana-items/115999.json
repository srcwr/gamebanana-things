The map is optimised for 6vs6 or 8vs8.\r\nThis release is a beta, I decided to go for beta instead of alpha because I feel that there are not that may bugs for it to be at a alpha release ect. There could be bugs/glitches/exploits so if possible if you find any post them here so that I can fix them.\r\n\r\nThis is a gungame map/deathmap map. \r\n\r\nMost of all I hope you enjoy playing on my map, And if you could, please give feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nModifier"
