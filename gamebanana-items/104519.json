	"_sText": "This is the alpha of de_urbancollege_a1. Obviously, it is an large urban college in the middle of a city. This is dev textured of course, due to it being an alpha. Due to this being a 420 release, one of the bombsites is designed to reflect that. The other bomb site has a bunch of random nuclear waste. These are placeholders. I do plan on changing the bomb sites when I texture it and go on to the beta version, but I just wanted to include something more then just 'bomb site crates' for the time being. \r\n\r\nIt is designed for 32-64 players and the map is very large with both indoor and outdoor combat. You can actually travel anywhere both indoors and outdoors and the map is easily large enough to have a good 64 player firefight without it being crowded."
