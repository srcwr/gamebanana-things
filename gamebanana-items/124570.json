	"_sText": "A new refreshed version of bhop_blend<br><br>The old version were made with a low knowledge of hammer and Source SDK and it just sucked. It also contained too much inspiration from bhop_fury_2. So i decided to remake it with improving as many things as i had patience to. If you got bhop_blend on your server, please remove it and switch to this one instead.&nbsp;<br><br><h1>This version include improvements as:</h1><br><b>•</b>&nbsp;New texture theme<br><b>•</b>&nbsp;Better lightning with a source from the brightness.&nbsp;<br><b>•</b>&nbsp;Gameplay having way better flow with the thought of <i>gaps </i>and <i>block size. </i>The old version had too many tiny bhop pads. It was more like the rule rather than the exception.<br>• Difficulty scales where as bhop_blend goes up and down<br>• New fitting music scenario that isnt loud as hell as for bhop_blend<br>• Details being more fulfill<br>• New visible stuff and ideas<br><br>Even though bhop is dead i still get entertained making these. Im not done yet.<br><br><h2><br><br></h2><br><br>"
