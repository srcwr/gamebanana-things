	"_sText": "Hello. I wanted to create maps. I wanted to do something very good. I did all this well for 5 months, because at that time I did not have experience. I read the tutorials on the official site of the Valve. And, frankly, I got it. But It's not a fact that the most experienced people will appreciate it. And I placed the map in order that all schoolchildren do not steal my map. For in Russia it is very well liked to do it. I think that for my first experience is normal. What do you say?<br>Games:<br>Climb with 3levels.<br>Bomberman(Yes, think correctly.)<br>Shootgame(break 20 targets)(teamplay)<br>Color game(i copied block's size in mg_swag_multigames,but realized differently.)<br>Football(with button's(kill red,and kill blue automatic,no matter the location of the players on the field.)<br>Laser game.<br>Find c4_bombs.(teamgame with table and interactive time)<br>Random maze(when terrorist find exit from maze,The exit immediately appears elsewhere.)(random)<br>Tron race.(i used CHarlie models and his prefab,when i was creating this game).(Charlie is the best)<br>And 3 easily races)<br>Disco."
