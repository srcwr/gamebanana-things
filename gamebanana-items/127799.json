Hope it's better. :P\r\n\r\nIn the first zone:\r\n\r\nyou spawn in front of the other team but there's an invisible wall. Then you must take the lift and go on the roof to buy your weapons (buyzone). After that, jump on the water block and you'll be teleported to the war zone.\r\n\r\nIn the second zone:\r\n\r\nyou spawn in a small ''house'' and there's a ''protection-wall'' in front of the spawn door. You can go on the 2 houses on the right/left (they are connected with a bridge) or in the middle building trough the gates."
