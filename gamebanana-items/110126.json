	"_sText": "This map type KA (Knife Arena) is composed of two rooms respawn, where both teams enemies appear, and a central room where the fight takes place centrally. Each player has possession of a knife and a grenade. The goal is obviously to remove all the players of the opposing team. However, the central hall hides many traps, dangerous or not, which can be activated by various players. Players can even obtain weapons, seeking a bit. Everyone must be careful where it goes, and where he sends his grenades while fighting the enemy."
