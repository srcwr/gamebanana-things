	"_sText": "An arena like 32 player map. As you might have guessed the map is in the sky...\r\n\r\nInstead of buyzones you start with a knife and a pistol with 24 rounds (glock for T, usp for CT) and you'll then have to pick up more weapons (there's plenty of 'em scattered across the map) unless you want to run out of bullets. You may have to rely on your knife from time to time when that happens though. \r\n\r\nThere are 12 pump-action shotguns (m3) and 12 Uzis (tmp, mac 10) in each spawn aswell.\r\n\r\nThere's atleast one of each weapon and grenade in the level except for that there is no AWP or semi-auto sniper rifles.\r\n\r\nAll the boxes seen in the screens are fully destructible and they'll have physics, with  few exceptions, and there're some traps, teleporters and hidden areas in the level aswell.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to RATE the map, and plz send feedback if there's something you want fixed or improved.\r\n\r\nEnjoy...\r\n\r\n\r\n*EDIT* New much better version made for TF2; [Link](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/157750 \"cp orange vertical\")\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
