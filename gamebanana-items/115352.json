	"_sText": "Although the simplicity of this map my trick you into thinking somthing else, the gameplay will sure make that doubt go away. This is a remake of the map 1corridor which is up on multiple servers constantly, and the reason for that is the surprisingly huge amount of fun and brilliant gameplay you get out of it. What i've done is updated this with a tottaly different theme and change of scenery, with a soundscape, props to give it that slight edge of realism and a destructable environment. There is a maximum of 20 players on each team making it a total of a 40 player game, crazy i know [;  Have fun and let me know what you think! [:"
