	"_sName": "cs_gerudo_valley v2",
	"_sText": "This is a new version with alot of bug fixes and general improvements on how the map looked and played.\r\nSome things I fixed/added included: soundscapes, fixed custom sounds, fixed door and stair errors, fixed place names, improved the 3d skybox, added flares to signify hostage rescue areas, packed custom content, and other minor stuff.\r\n\r\nI modeled this map very closely after the Gerudo Valley Fortress found in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The layout of the fortress is very similar, I only had to change one or two small things as the dimensions didn't quite match up.\r\n\r\nThe Counter-terrorists start half near the gate, the others by the stairs. The terrorist start outside, at the top of the fortress. It may seem a bit unbalanced between teams. However after testing with people and bots, it was actually pretty even most of the time.\r\n\r\nThere are four hostages, the difference is they are spread out unlike most Hostage Rescue maps. The hostages are located the same place as the hostage in Ocarina of Time, to keep with the accuracy of the map.\r\nThe map also includes a custom nav file and Radar Overlay.\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster Eggs!\r\n\r\nThere is a lever on one of the walls outside. When puled, you will hear the Sounds of Storms. and the fairy fountain will open up.\r\n\r\nThe radio, near the fruit crates outside, can change music, just press use on the front of it to the Koroki Shop music. All radios that play music, will stop if they take damage.\r\n\r\nIf you redistribute this map elsewhere, make sure you keep the credits there, You do not need to have this whole Readme, but everyone should be credited for their role in this map."
