Lots of different ways to play.\r\n\r\nIt took me about 5 days to make, and I made it from scratch, and I'm not 100% happy about it, more like 99% but there's always something you want to make better so I think it's as good as it gets.\r\n\r\nVisually it's stunning, the gameplay rules. I've mixed funny parts from other maps including de_dust2, de_aztec and de_cbble (Only thing from cbble is all boxes in bomb site B)\r\n\r\nIf you're running a server and wish to run my map please contact me first. (I've got tons of more fun maps) \r\n\r\nE-mail: johan16_g@hotmail.com"
