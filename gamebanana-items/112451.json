There is one hidden item, but I'll let you figure that out for yourselves.\r\n\r\nThis is still in beta, so there are bound to be a few errors and bugs here and there, but me and some friends are testing the map as I type this, so these bugs will be found and erased quite fast.\r\n\r\nThat's all I got to say, have fun!\r\n\r\n0.2: Fix'd some bugs where people spawned at the same place"
