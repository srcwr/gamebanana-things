It's a quick release, but I've added over 20+ climbing areas, and expanded the map with brand-new areas, and even a couple of secret ones. The map has an even better frame rate then it ever has before thanks to my optimizing methods. \r\n\r\nThe screenshots show just some of the newest additions to the map, but trust me, there's many more than I can show you. So, by all means, download the map and test it yourself. There's some minor graphical glitches in the map involving the skybox, but nothing that harms gameplay. \r\n\r\nThis is a beta release, but I expect to get a final out sooner rather than later, as there's not much I expect to change from this release other than bugs and those graphical errors I was talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy the map, everyone.\r\nComments and assessments are more than welcome.\r\nBig thanks to Valve for such a great map.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n£cho\r\nOfficial FPSBanana ZombieMod Representative"
