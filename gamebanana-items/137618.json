At low they will simply be phenominal but lack the nice look of the map obvisially.\r\n\r\nRadar and custom textures are included within the bsp as well to keep everything clean. Nav file is also included for convience.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset>\r\nFor those who have been watching for the past week you now have the chance to play it.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset>\r\nIts currently on two of our servers:\r\n\r\n69.65.14.206:27015 Weapons of Mass Destruction - GunGame Deathmatch\r\n\r\n205.234.203.141:27015 Weapons of Mass Destruction - GunGame Turbo (HLStatsX)\r\n\r\nSo pop in and play both styles of the game, each has its quirks :P\r\n</fieldset>\r\n<fieldset>\r\nAlso, since I don't have any real immediate projects on the go I can accept Gun Game map requests/ideas via Half Life Storm studios.\r\nLost,\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<div><center><a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" property=\"dc:title\">wmd_pulsar</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/109641\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Logan Dougall</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike 2.5 Canada License</a>.<br />Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/109641\" rel=\"cc:morePermissions\">Here</a>.</center></div>"
