So I came up with this, a totally new version of fy_poolday, it has much more detail, and a nice ambient.\r\n\r\n<b>Features:</b>\r\n> nice environment\r\n> fishes\r\n> custom textures/models\r\n> drops\r\n> buyzone\r\n> bombsite (inside the pool)\r\n> 2 secondary roots\r\n\r\nI tried to keep everything like the original one, just changing the style, so thats the final result.\r\nSpecial thanks to <i>TopHATTwaffle</i> for providing really unique custom textures, and to whoever created the original version, I'm sorry, there are so many versions I simply don't know who is the real author.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it,\r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/68/subcolorfull3.png\"></div>"
