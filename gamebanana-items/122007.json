	"_sText": "My biggest inspiration in this map was the surf_buck series made by bucknasty, simply because he makes the most detailed maps that are fun and still look great to play on, unlike maps like surf_greatriver (no offence intended). I don't know why the water flickers at spawn, that is one bug that i couldn't fix and tried many times, it would look cool if you were stoned though. The only bug i can think of is the water in between spawn, which is actually put there on purpose, to trick faggots who think camping in between spawn is cool, I also made it amazingly close to impossible to shoot through top of jail, since i covered it with the perfect water texture. There is only one awp in the map, located at the very top, also a bombsite there, the objective is obviously to plant the bomb at the very top of the map and the ct's to surf there and defuse it, however thats not always the case, since there are a few secrets throughout the map that only the lucky ones will find. Most of all, enjoy the map.\r\n\r\n****Put map in local disk/program files/steam/steamapps/*whateverthefuckyouraccountnameis*/counterstrikesource/cstrike/maps\r\n\r\nDo not decompile this map unless you ask for permission."
