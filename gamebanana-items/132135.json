The crane will take you to a building's roof, where you can launch a nuke :P\r\n\r\n---\r\nFeautures:\r\n\r\n- Destroyable stairs\r\n- Destroyable floors\r\n- Crane\r\n- Enough places to camp at, while waiting the crane\r\n- Big bad nuke boom!\r\n- Secret chamber :D\r\n---\r\n\r\n-FAQ-\r\n\r\nQ: I was too late to get on the platform, what now?\r\nA: Welcome to hell.\r\n\r\nQ: Nobody got on the platform, what now?\r\nA: You still can protect yourself ON the construction site, and you still can win, because nobody will push the nuke button.\r\n\r\nQ: Do humans have any chances to win?\r\nA: Yes, maybe even more than zombies. Humans can break the floor, stairs. That will make zombie's life harder. Humans also can easily shoot zombies off the poles without any floor on it. So, you have to destroy the floor as fast as you can."
