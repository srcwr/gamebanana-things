The map is set around some pyramids in ruin/desert type scenario. It includes bridges, water, underground passages, sniper positions and of course, double doors!\r\n\r\n\r\nCTs: Prevent the terrorist scum bags from bombing the ancient Cross of Destiny (site A), and the boxes containing valuable Egyptian artifacts (site B).\r\n\r\n\r\nTs: You have two targets here, and bombing either of the two will result in success! Expect heavy resistance from those law abiding CT scum.\r\n\r\nGL & HF!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditonal thanks to flatmates Catalyst and Grogs for ideas throughout the project.\r\n"
