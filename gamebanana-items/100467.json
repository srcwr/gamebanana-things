FIND IT <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/207907\">HERE</a>.</span><br></b><br>cs_sonicschoolhouse, now at night!<hr>A map I've wanted to publish for a while. This is actually a ported map from Garry's Mod by Steam user Cookie Senpai. I had fun playing this map by myself with bots. So since I've joined the GameBanana community, the idea of finally publishing this struck me.<br><br>Anyways, this is a hostage rescue map along with complete bot navigation. The map has 9 hostages within it. Like my previously uploaded map, this has no map overview/radar due to my resolution on my computer.<br><br>Have fun! ;)"
