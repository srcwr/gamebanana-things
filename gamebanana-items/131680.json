Can you find them?...yeah probably.)\r\nThe map has 42 Spawn points. I recommend as much players as you can get. \r\n\r\nFeel free to edit this map if you wish, just give credit. \r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nUpdate:\r\n-Fixed CT buy zone\r\n-Built cube maps\r\n-Elevator's fubar so I slapped a ladder in there.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nYou can find this map at:\r\n81.171.96.75:27015\r\n\r\nhttp://img101.imageshack.us/img101/9636/zmmap010000dx5.jpg\r\n\r\nHappy Hunting.\r\n"
