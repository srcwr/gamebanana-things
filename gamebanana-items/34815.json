It's a completely created from scratch and fully hand-tuned .nav-file (because in original mapauthor's release was included simple auto-gen).<br><br>\r\nThis Navigation Mesh was hand-maded at 80% because in auto-gen nav some areas were made incorrectly and many paths were blocked (even the only one ladder were absolutely impassable).<br><br>\r\nWell... bots use all possible ways now. And this time visit of financial police will end with the real bloody harvest! :D<br><br>\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/13165\">same map</a>.<br><br>\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also don't lazy to write your responses ;-)<br><br>\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\nCosmic Fool (for fine designed and high detailed sequel of the legendary map).<br><br>\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>\r\nAnother Perfect Day... in Quite Office! :-)<br><br>"
