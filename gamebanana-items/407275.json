	"_sText": "Milo's Triad of Terror map pack is a map pack consisting of three maps. de_clay, de_boneyard, and de_maizefarm are the maps included. At first, these maps were just for me and my friends to mess around on. However, a little after I created de_boneyard I thought of creating a map pack to publish online. These secret filled maps are great to play casually, and are designed with fun in mind.<br><br>de_clay is a swamp dominated by darkness, and requires a flashlight or night vision goggles to know where you're going.<br><br>de_boneyard is a graveyard consisting of pumpkins, walls, and (obviously) graves! Be warned however, sometimes the dark and ghoulish night fog reddens, and a clutter of skeletons arrive to dance!<br><br>de_maizefarm is in the frontlines of a human vs. alien war. Taking place on a rinky-dink farm with plenty of corn to go around!<br><br>Feel free to host this on your server!<br><br>(remember theres like easter eggs everywhere so try and find them all!)"
