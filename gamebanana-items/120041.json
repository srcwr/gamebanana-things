	"_sText": "Starwars re-made from 1.6. This map was requested from a friend of mine so I attempted to re-create it. This is pretty close to the original except you can control R2D2 and R4D4 and have them shoot out missiles. I wanted to have a cam for both robots but the source engine only allows for one camera and monitor at a time, so R4D4 has no monitor.\r\n  The Sand crawler is also not drivable like the original because of real physics the source engine has, so it is on a track. The land speeders take a little time to get used to driving because of the lack of the function_drivable in the source engine."
