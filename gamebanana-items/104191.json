The terrorists raided the temple grounds killing civilian researchers.  They then began looking for the treasure they thought was buried somewhere on the site.\r\n\r\nHowever, the terrorists would rather blow up the temples than let any treasure fall into the hands of the enemy! The counter-terrorists must protect the two targets from the suicidal terrorists. \r\n\r\nThis is the second version of Sunken Temple.  This version gets rid of the original Bombsite A and combines it into the CT spawn.  The result is that the map is smaller and easier to play on with fewer players. The running time between the two bombsites is significantly shorter compared to the original map.\r\n\r\nThe Original map can be found here: [http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/154320](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/154320 \"http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/154320\")\r\n\r\nPlease download, comment and enjoy!\r\n\r\n- 64 Spawns\r\n- Optimized for better FPS\r\n- Custom Palm trees by -:Steve-o:- of GameBanana.com\r\n- Original de_aztec content from Valve\r\n- Cubemaps\r\n- Nav File with place names\r\n- 3d Sky Box\r\n- Radar Overview Image\r\n- Pakrat"
