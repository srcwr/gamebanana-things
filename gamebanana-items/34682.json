This configuration is designed for those who prefer to play without unnecessary visual effects (reflections, blood, bullet holes, sprays, palm leaves, etc.). And also, and those who have weak computers.\r\n###### If you know the value of all the commands, you can modify to your liking. Not recommended for inexperienced.\r\n**Solutions to the problem:**\r\n\r\n- If you got kicked from the server, enter the console and reset your esl.\r\n- If you get a blue screen during the game or just crash - remove the section \"Threading\"\r\n- If you start friezes (joists) - Change the mat_queue_mode to -2\r\n\r\np.s. _**mat_filtertextures** - Texture filtering (0 = if you want put the squares | default = 1) [See screenshot]_\r\n\r\n###### Soon, I will lay out the config for TF2 and DoDs"
