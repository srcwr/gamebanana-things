	"_sText": "A non-cluttered (I get 150fps on max res/settings DX9) port of the classic DM3 map from Quake 1. Not changed much, only added some slight detail here and there, and broke through a wall for balancing purposes (three ways to bombsites instead of just two).\r\n\r\nI made this map a loooong time ago, for personal use, but since nobody ported any q1 maps, I thought I'd at least release this one. Also, I already know about all the mapping errors (it was made a long time ago) and illogical lighting (I tried to \"explain\" the lighting with skylights, but I might've missed some).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope there's a Q1 fan like me out there who'll appreciate this."
