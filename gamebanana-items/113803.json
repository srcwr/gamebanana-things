If you try to rush you get teleported to a jail! Terrorists and Counterterrorists have their own. If someone is afk you can use the bridge to go on the other side (only way to rush).\r\n\r\nok have fun with it, i hope you like it\r\n\r\nSteam: [bonebraker18](http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonebraker18 \"ADD ME\")"
