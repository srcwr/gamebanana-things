Once you complete 5 sections you complete the map. The RNG in CS:S can be iffy so sometimes you get the same thing often.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bdEyCMLRbCs?t=13\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/bdEyCMLRbCs?t=13</a><br><br>This was intended to be a proof of concept for another much more complex map but I ended up finishing it and never making the other map lmao.<br><br>I've included the source files so you can see how it works."
