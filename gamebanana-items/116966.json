I wish I can tell u who built like the Trees, but I did not. \r\nI did build and design the whole map, but borrowed a few things like the Trees. \r\nI aimed for a more open Texture map and uniqe. I would like to get a high rating on this......This map fits 40+ players\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO YEA NO TEXTURES WILL BE ADDED.
