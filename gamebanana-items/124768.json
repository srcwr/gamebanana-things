	"_sText": "This is a medium-long map which has 6 large stages, and 6 different environments. \r\n\r\nIt is made to be played on scroll/legit/normal settings, 100 tickrate, sv_gravity 800, 250 groundvel and a sv_airaccelerate with a minimum of 100.\r\n\r\nI would describe the player difficulty as medium to hard, but it gets more difficult as longer you get into the stages.\r\n\r\nThere has been some annoying errors through this project, and i got Tony Montana to help me with some optimization. Thanks to Tony for that!\r\n\r\nHope you will like the gameplay. Have fun!"
