A lot of testing and game play mechanics went into creating Gridlock to fit the game style of Counter-strike verse Gears of Wars game style. I hope everyone enjoys it, there are new area's and different advantage points vs the Gears of War version. \r\n\r\nI give a lot of thanks to my alpha/beta testing team for giving me a lot on thoughts about the game play and design structure. They put a lot of hours into testing the map and giving constructive feed back. \r\n\r\nAlpha/Beta Testers:\r\n\r\nPsycholiquid71 aka Temera\r\nZ3n\r\nRiddick\r\nZero\r\nBig"
