It was made over the course of 2-3 days and only has about 20 hours of work. I used Hamster's custom textures to make it. You can find his FPSB profile here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/members/153451\r\n\r\n\r\nMAP FEATURES:\r\n\r\n** Ultra-fast routes to each side of the map on the outward sides!\r\n** Breakable bricks that line the top perimeter of each castle!\r\n** Breakable crates all over the outside of the map!\r\n** Strategically placed HE Grenades!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nI really wanted to make a Simpsons map. If anyone wants to let me borrow their Simpsons textures I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOME PLAY THIS MAP ON MY SERVER:\r\n\r\n72.26.102.140:27015\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease leave questions/comments/suggestions. Also, did I mention I want some Simpsons textures? :)\r\n\r\n\r\nENJOY !!!"
