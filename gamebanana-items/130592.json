Been doing alot of testing so this version should be fine for all.\r\n\r\nKey Points\r\n\r\n.Good spawn. 'same one seen in my other maps'\r\n\r\n.Easy maze.\r\n\r\n.No pointless runing 'meaning every time you run, you have the chance of having zombies right behind.\r\n\r\n.Semi Large defending stage, where people need to defend a small fort.\r\n\r\n.Climbing stage, not every one is going to make it to the top in time. But this makes it even better when you get to the top and live.\r\n\r\n.New art style.\r\n\r\n'warning this map is stronge on hdr'\r\n\r\nAlso dont resubmit my work, or send my drunk friends after you!"
