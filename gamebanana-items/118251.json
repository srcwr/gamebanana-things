In this map I try to create an arena where you can shoot from different places like the spot in the attic or the spots in the three ramps where you can be covered by boxes. You can try to rush too running through the boxes to knife your opponents, but that is not the idea. I hope you enjoy the map, I worked in it with the intention you all play it, please rate and post comments. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Skybox (de_cbble)\r\n- Navigation and overview\r\n- Nice envinment and environmental sounds\r\n- 30 player slots\r\n- Well optimize\r\n\r\nQuestions and bugs: alangabriel_7@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nGood luck and enjoy it."
