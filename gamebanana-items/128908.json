	"_sText": "Hi! This is my new Saw map. After making this a long time, i finally got it here.\r\n\r\nThis map is kind of \"room escape\" map, so to find a way out you have to solve several puzzles. And thats why this map is a bit different than other saw maps.\r\n\r\nSome rooms in this map are from the Saw movies, and i have tried to make them look realistic. Hope you like it!\r\n\r\nFinal fix done. I also added walktrough txt. file in the download, but its recommended use only if you really dont know what to do.\r\n\r\nCheck out my other maps too------->[here!](http://www.gamebanana.com/members/submissions/maps/907575 \"\")"
