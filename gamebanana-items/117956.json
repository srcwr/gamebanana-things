	"_sText": "This map was made with the intention of balancing out snipers, so players can dominate the map with SMGs and Shotguns instead of just Rifles. The fort inside was designed like a lazer tag map, so there are plenty of corners and passageways for tactical presiscion. There also is a long hallway on the side for those who are fans of snipers. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIn the sniper hall, the corner has a crack which leads all the way to the other side, so one can snipe through the crack. It's awesome for a loltastic experience!"
