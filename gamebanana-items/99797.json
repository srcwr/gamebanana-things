	"_sText": "Ok, so here's my third map and it is beautiful! I've included hostages and lots of fun little surprises. You can shoot out lights to fight in the dark. There are vents, windows, doors, creepy sounds, ladders, breakable props, etc. It's built like a small mansion with only a few open rooms. Looks easy, but it's more difficult to get hostages to safety than get to them. Really fun to play and very detailed.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ERRORS: One minor lighting error in the main hall balcony, and one major error with loading a terrorist spawn point. (Sorry!)"
