(Old A)\r\n- Different Boxes at A.\r\n- Less cover inside of tunnels.\r\n- Added barrels inbetween CT Spawn and Tunnels.\r\n- Moved the T Spawn back further to even the teams\r\n-Eliminated the first section of gate near t Spawn to eliminate to fast of Rushing to B.\r\n- Revised for a 2v2 tournament.\r\n- Raised the trimming above temple so you can run on it rather than duck.\r\n- Quicker CT Rushes because of raised displacements.\r\n- More lighting in Tunnels and Temple.\r\n- Eliminated Fog because of the advantage for CTs inside Temple and Tunnels.\r\n- Better environmental lighting.\r\n- A few other small details like easier ledge climbing.\r\n\r\nPlease redownload and reasses.
