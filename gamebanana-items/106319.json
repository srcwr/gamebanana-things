Map contains just the Deasert Eagle and a series of baracades. Simply pick up a pistol and shoot, that is it, just like most other Aim maps. It's just this one is a freaking beast! If you have any suggestions just message me or leave a comment on this map. Thankyou for looking, I plan on posting more maps in the future."
