It has a nice and different Design, a dark lightning and some good music. I don't had good ideas for unique Minigames. This map has 64 spawns. I used some MiP's and maps as minigames, thanks to the Authors that all are credited! If I missed someone write a comment.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\n<fieldset class=\"OrangeBorder\">\r\n<legend class=\"RedColor\">MINIGAMES INSIDE</legend>\r\n\r\n- Football\r\n- Iceskate\r\n- Smokebattle\r\n- Aim \r\n- Knife\r\n- Canyon Knife\r\n- Grenade War\r\n- Canon knife\r\n- Skipping Rope\r\n- AWP\r\n- Dodgeball (with one ball and 10hp)\r\n- Random (not even a game.
