I just used these things to recreate the level on the Source engine.\r\n\r\nThanks to Eidos Montreal/ Ion Storm for the great game and the inspiration for this map.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks to the Zombie Gods clan ZM server for hosting this map for beta testing.\r\n\r\nThere are 64 spawn points, guns and grenades placed around the map, cading areas, and areas to hold off zombies. There are also a couple secrets guns with sprite trails, and one secret area containing another secret gun. There are no teleporters in this map.\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nThis map was only tested on a ZM server with reload, I don't know how it will play on an unlimited ammo server."
