[>>Masogs blog<<](http://masog.wordpress.com \"\")\r\n\r\nThis is my new map mg_, and first course map.\r\nYou must beat 8 levels. My best record on this map - _2 minutes 41 seconds_. _(New record!! :] 2 minutes 25 seconds)_\r\n\r\nI did this map in something like 20 hours of work in Hammer Editor.\r\n\r\nThis map is in beta2 version, and it's tested on MultiPlayer and SinglePlayer and it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nBeta2 changes:\r\n\r\n- AFK Killer after 40 seconds.\r\n- 3 Level is easier. After every 10 seconds unbreakable places of floor are green. Breakable pieces of floor are \"more\" breakable.\r\n- 4 Level is easier. After every 5 seconds you can see white blocks and you know where to jump.\r\n- Removed dead sound.\r\n- Added arrows to the TIPs and MAPs.\r\n- Last jump to the END is easier.\r\n\r\nMax players: 46\r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\n\r\n- No-Block plugin,\r\n\r\nRecommend:\r\n\r\n- Race Timer plugin.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)"
