The teams start out on the main floor, with adjoining rooms that include and armory and a hallway (complete with secret passage), also includes monitors that show underground.  The next floor up has a windowed room, access to the roof via two different ladders, a bridge connecting the sides of the map, and another secret room.  The roof has a sniper tower.  There is a tunnel system that connects the two sides."
