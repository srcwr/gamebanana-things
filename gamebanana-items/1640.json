It's just a random idea I came up with for something like a jail in a futuristic surf map or something, only I didn't need it so I thought I'd release it for others to use, hope you like! If you would like to change colours just select the lasers individually and open up the properties , you should see the beam colour part. Same thing with beam damage, I currently have it set to like 10000 / second.. But if you don't want insta kill you can change it."
