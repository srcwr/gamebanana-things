It's just an average map made for fun.Â <br><br>The map itself is T3 and probably around 1:15:1:30. I haven't had any testers though so I could be off from that.<br><br>There are three bonuses<br>1st bonus: 10-20 seconds & slightly technical/climby<br>2nd bonus: 15-25 seconds & strafey<br>3rd bonus: 25-35 seconds & strafey but with some small climbs, surfs and boosters<br>If your server doesn't support multiple bonuses, I'd suggest the 1st bonus.<br>The map hasn't been tested by other people so if there are some dumb skips, lmk"
