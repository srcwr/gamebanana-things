	"_sText": "This is my first texture map that I have ever made. Its a red (terrorists) versus the blue (counter-terrorists). I spend about a week on this and plan to make another version. (already have plans drawn up for it) It'll be a _v2 and I hope to make it a bit bigger and better. For now this is a smallish map with a river in between each side. There are runners above them for sniping, a bunker on each side, and plenty of cover. This would fit a dm type server if you wanted it to, but it also includes a buyzone. Sorry the pics are a tab dark :( Well hope you guys enjoy it and please leave notes for upgrades you would like to see and if its in a server or put into your server leave the server info. Thanks a ton!\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE:</b> I know the map doesnt look \"beautiful\" but the game play is pretty fun, good for a server and fps friendly.\r\n\r\n-Jarhead"
