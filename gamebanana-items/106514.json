	"_sText": "It's probably already been done before, but here's my version of COD4's Killhouse for CS:S.  I made this about a month after the original map for COD4 was released. If I can recall, it took 7 hours to complete.  There's still things I can do to further optimize it, & bring it more to scale with the original, but first I want to see if any of you even like it, and if it's worth my time to fix it.  If I do get positive reactions on this, then I will work more on it to lower filesize and make it look better."
