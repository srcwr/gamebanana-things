	"_sText": "For around 10 months ago, i released my first project bhop_dreamtour. The purpose was to make a hard auto map, and also the longest bhop map ever made. As long as i created the levels, i didn't know very much about compiling and optimizing a level, which caused i had to cut the map into 2 maps, and release bhop_dreamtour2 in a couple of time afterwards.\r\n\r\nNow i have remade some parts in the map, and added some more detail to it, but a lot of the map was builded 10 month ago, so i had to make the environment roughly based on the rooms/creations.\r\n\r\nI have remade this map to be PLAYED ON LEGIT! since it will be too linear with the autobhop gameplay it had, as the very first time.\r\n\r\nIt has different non in-real-life themes as bhop_dreamtour has. and the difficulty is pretty hard overall. It starts a little easier and gets harder through the levels and stages. Some stages is a bit long.\r\n\r\nIt can be played on normal scroll/legit settings with 100 tickrate, sv_airaccelerate 100, sv_gravity 800, fps_max 300 and no scout/260 ground speed, but also good gameplay for autobhop settings 100 tickrate.\r\n\r\nThanks for George and Dream for testing the levels. have fun."
