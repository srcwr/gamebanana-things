Testing it was great, the map is very fun and literally perfect for gun game. Lots of good coverage, an underground short-cut, some paths that will lead to enemies popping up and surprising you, some direct paths, it's overall really fun.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this piece of art, and would be honored to see it on a server.\r\n\r\nAlso this map is recommended to have the color saturation on your monitor all the way up, it's so awesome."
