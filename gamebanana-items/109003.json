	"_sText": "Developed by Dylan Hughes in 2009 for the clan Absolute Mayhem. This map is fairly big but not as big as it looks. The epic skybox that gives the map its atmosphere is actually the result of a mapping bug but i left it in as i think it makes the map awesome. There is an underwater tunnel in the middle where you can get to the bridge in the center. There is more cover in this map than any other texture map i've played. EXTREMELY fun to play in, even with 3-4 people. There is also a knife arena that is accessible by a teleporter and there is a secret button that will kill everyone in the vicinity that works once a round."
