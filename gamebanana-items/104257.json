	"_sText": "So this is my 3rd real map and ends the trilogy of CS Source maps i have created. Everything in this, like on my other maps too, have been done from scratch. I have not edited any existing maps or anything, this is all from my own head. So In this map, i wanted to try out another scenario. 1 close bombsite and 1 more far away. Its all about the teamwork which team will win. There are enough routes to avoid bottleneck fights and it is fully balanced for both teams!\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#00FF00\">This map is on cycle at server: <b>89.166.50.111:27025</b> </font>\r\n\r\nI created this during 2 months of time. This is the best optimized map i have done since the start to the end. It compiles on normal only in 19 minutes which i consider a good result! I left HDR off because it cutted -100fps off straight on, even if i really tried to optimize it to the map. It did that even if it wouldnt be on at players PC but the map had support for HDR. Weird stuff, i know but map looks fine without it too! Playability over eyecandy, thats my motto.\r\n\r\nCheck out all my other maps from <font color=\"#0000FF\"><a href=\"http://www.ics-base.net/css_maps\">http://www.ics-base.net/css_maps</a></font>"
