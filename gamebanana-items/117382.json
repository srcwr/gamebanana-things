	"_sText": "This map was made specifically for death match servers, but once it was finished, I realized it would also work very well as a gun game map. \r\n\r\nThe main structures of the map consist of 4 buildings, 2 bunkers and various boxes on the ground. \r\n\r\nThis map was personally tested by me in a bot server. It was really much more fun than I expected bots to be on this map, I'd love to see it played on a real server with real people. \r\n\r\nThe bridges that connect roof top to roof top are breakable, their health has been set to 200 each. But breaking them would make it impossible to move from one room to another without going on the ground.\r\n\r\nI would recomment 30 people for this map, although there are enough spawn points for more. I played this map with 20 people on a bot server and it worked just fine, and it only started lagging once I reached about 60 people. "
