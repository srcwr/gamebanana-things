They are threatening\r\nto close it and destroy the entrance to the mine\r\nsealing the mine owners inside. They have now taken up\r\narms and are guarding the mine with their lives.  \r\n\r\nA group of Counter-Terrorists have been dispatched to\r\napprehend the group of angry miners.  The counter-terrorists\r\nhave arrived and now the battle starts!"
