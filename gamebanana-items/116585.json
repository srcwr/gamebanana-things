	"_sText": "This map is all about reflexes.  imagine medieval jousting with shortrange shotguns, yeaah you like that ; ).  Final4 allows up to 16 people to joust simutaneously, and fixed all the bugs with players getting stuck and falling past the teleporter.  The map is best played with 4-8 players, but mayham with 16 can be fun if you're rig can handle it."
