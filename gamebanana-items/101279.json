The final version will also include an optimized nav file with place names and smart bots. Also includes an overview/radar.\r\n\r\nThe layout is somewhat chaotic (there are many ways to flank/sneak around) but still very tactical. Just about every gun and style of play is accommodated with a few long areas for sniping, many close areas for short-range combat and everything in-between."
