Terrorists have taken hostages to get the return of their comrades from prison. \r\n\r\nMissile control rooms are in the lower area accessible from two directions, small rooms, small hallways low lighting make for a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nI repaired the bsp ( fixed sounds, missing textures), sorry for the mixup.\r\n\r\nPLEASE RE DOWNLOAD to fix your map."
