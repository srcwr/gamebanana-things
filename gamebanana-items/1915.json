Also, you can climb up his tail and get to his head. \r\n\r\nI didn't really find a texture I liked, so I manipulated a prop texture. I wasn't sure I could really make one that went with it well. I didn't like the idea of just a solid green one, though maybe you'll find that that is your preference. \r\n\r\nIf anyone uses this in a map, I would love to see their work so please PM me or send a steam friend request to Dr. Kepper"
