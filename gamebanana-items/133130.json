	"_sText": "A modified replica of the Forest Temple from Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64), made from scratch for zombie mod with original textures/models/music.\r\n\r\n**Items** - Items taken directly from the game with similar effects that you can use as a human against the zombies and vice versa. Humans loot the chests which are scattered around the map, zombies break the pots. Instructions on how to use each item is available upon pickup.\r\n\r\n**Sizeable** - Areas open and close depending on how many players there are, including spectators. Admins can override this by no-clipping to the unreachable room near the entrance.\r\n\r\n**Secrets**\r\n\r\n**Loads of cading/hiding spots**"
