I also lost my motivation to continue working on it. I would like someone to finish this map off, carry on where I finished. I would also like credit if you do complete this map.\r\n\r\n<A href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/studios/projects/view/6453\">View more screenshots here!</a>\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback if you are going to use and complete this map, along with links to the progress of the map."
