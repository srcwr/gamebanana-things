I couldnt really make a good screeny of how big the map is because of the lighting and alot of jumps close to each other. I also added the \"task - treat\"-system into my map: after you complete a part: turn on the radio and listen some music. Have fun!\r\n\r\nP.S.: Everything u need to know about installing is in ->XC_OVERCLIMB.HTM!!<-\r\nedit: full version uploaded after max file size increase"
