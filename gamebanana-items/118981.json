All players spawn with knife, AWP, and nightvision.  The map is very basic, and very dark.  I tried to keep it simple enopugh to minimize round times, but big enough to double zoom AWP.  This map has alot of water covering much of it, so when you lack sight use the sound of players movin in the water to help you. There is a buyzone in the middle of the map.  Also, there are 2 tunnels in the middle that quickly move you to either side of the map using trigger_pushes and teleports.  The tunnels are hidden behind breakable brushes.\r\n\r\nHopefully the large amount of dark space in the map doesn't make it to hard and difficult to play.  Have fun and feel free to contact me with additional ideas for a final.\r\n\r\ncontact: kaos4u@gmail.com"
