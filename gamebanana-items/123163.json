All the credit of this map goes to MooK, as he has helped me with everything from adding ammo to the guns, to simply putting a spawn point. He has helped me a ton and I appreciate it a lot. I would also like to thank Freakout, Pelican, WhaThe, G-Daddy, Puss'N'Boots, and everyone else who has helped contribute to the ideas for the map.\r\n\r\nThere are a few secrets, some better than others, but it is your job to find them. I have decompile-protected the map.\r\n\r\nIf you are wanting to create a new version of this map, please add me to your xfire, and have some maps present that you have done to show me you are worthy! :D\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-Toxic\r\n"
