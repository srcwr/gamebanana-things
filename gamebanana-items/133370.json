Mostly, I wanted to pretty it up and correct the lighting. I considered a 3D skybox, but decided against it at the last minute and used this killer skybox texture (I forget who made it, but kudos to who did... it's awesome!).<br><br>I can only really take credit for the changes that were made, to be honest. I only added my name (Gillman) because it's my version. Thanks!</p>"
