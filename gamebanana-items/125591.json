	"_sText": "Hello, this is my second attempt of creating a bunnyhop map and for this one i wanted to be more detailed and have that nature look. Map is a free open world , you cant jump anywhere you like except the ground! I didnt add the trigger multiples on jumping pads, you can jump on props, etc.. you can speedrun it thro numerous routes and stuff, just dont fall down.Â  The start zone and the end zone for more precise timing have been added.<br><br>Enjoy!"
