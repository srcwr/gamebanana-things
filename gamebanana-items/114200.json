	"_sText": "This map was made similar to my origonal shootsalot maps. Although this one is much smaller, doesn't have a bomb site or hostages, and has much better lighting and overall looks better. Just like the origonal, I put a building in and made it possible to go under the building and also on top to the roof. \r\n\r\nThe much smaller size of this map, as opposed to the origonals, makes it better for use in games such as gungame. The origonals were far too big for this sort of gameplay and would be much more suited as a deathmatch map.\r\n\r\nI also included rain in this map to give it a bit more of a realistic effect. \r\n\r\nI also included a .nav file to have fun with bots with. Although using this map with bots was a mistake for me. I tried it and really got beaten really badly with the bots set on easy. Bots seem to be really good on this map.\r\n\r\nWell, I hope you like it. Try it out and assess it."
