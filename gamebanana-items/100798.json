I would also like to thank Magikus & StarD00d (d00ds.com) for alot of the textures used in this map.\r\n      These guys are the real map makers. My server Noobs Only runs there maps 24/7.\r\n      As far as known issues. The only thing i don't like is the way the bots behave.It's just the design of the map.\r\n      storyline, Terrorist want to destroy a casino in space.  \r\n \r\n                                    Thanks Silly\r\n\r\n"
