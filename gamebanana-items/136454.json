	"_sText": "Before ANYONE says anything, I know I spelled sanctuary wrong in the map title. Lets just ignore this small typo and move on.\r\n\r\nI made this map to have a large, but fast paces map for gungame. This map is quite large long ways, but fairly short straight across. The main part of the map is the 2 buildings in the map, both are almost exactly identical. I also have a small bridge going across from one building to another.\r\n\r\nI also included 66 spawn points in the map to make the spawning a little more random as to where the person actually spawns.\r\n\r\nSorry about the map being a little dark, It was a pain in the ass to get it to brighten up at all, I've honestly never had so much of a probably trying to make a map bright. It was much darker before, now it is fairly bright and just bright enough to offer a very exciting game if given the chance in your server.\r\n\r\nTry it out, give me an assessment. Constructive Criticism is ALWAYS accepted and helps a lot."
