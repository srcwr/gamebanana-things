The lighting and environment still needs to be adjusted, so don't make too much fuss about it.\r\n\r\nThis project was not done alongside the original creator, but I wouldn't want to take the credit away from creating the map. I did decompile the map for the measurements, though.\r\n\r\nWatch this map for more updates, as they may or may not push out quickly.\r\n\r\n"
