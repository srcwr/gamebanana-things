The beta is\r\n                       called FY, but it does have buy zones and the\r\n                       only gun laying on the ground is an AWP in the\r\n                       very center of the map.  There are NO hostages\r\n                       or bomb targets.  Please leave feedback on the\r\n                       FPSBanana post for this map.  I will make my\r\n                       best attempt to get all reasonable requests\r\n                       and suggestions into the final version.
