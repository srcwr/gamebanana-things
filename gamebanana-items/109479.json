	"_sText": "Since before the dawn of man, the mysterious beings known as the Architects have done and built great things.\r\n\r\nThis grand temple on their homeworld, Akkikkosass, is in truth a city, for behind these stone walls lay circuits that house the true form of these Gods, the essence that lives within the mythical Golems that built our world- sentient electricity, highly intelligent, and endlessly pondering this Reality.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAIM Architects, a science fantasy map, takes place in a city of the mysterious Architect race, who can best be described as ''electric space Aztecs''. It is a medium-sized map with a balance between long, narrow halls and vast atriums- and even includes a large, yet claustrophobic three-level atrium. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of ambush points, as well as two elevated sniping positions in the main atrium, which can be reached by ladder. On the lower level of the main atrium, near the claustrophobic atrium, lies a decorated stone disk that emits a magical healing field. \r\n\r\nTake heed when dropping down to this heal zone, however, for there is only one way out- through the C-atrium, where one is easily ambushed. High risk, high reward.\r\n\r\nSpawn rooms have buyzones. T spawns in the west wing, CT in the east wing."
