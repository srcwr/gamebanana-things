THis map has the following ;\r\n\r\n-Chicken Fight and knife fight cage on roof\r\n-Shot for shot and racing in the back\r\n-Jump shot around CT spawn\r\n-6 Big cells that can hold many T's ( only open from inside )\r\n-A cage where the Ct's can keep T's and check for guns\r\n-Lots of rebeling spots\r\n-A big building with many rooms\r\n-And much, much more!\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\nSpecial thanks to ;\r\n\r\n-Thepwned Community\r\n-Tag community\r\n-Moe\r\n-Major pain\r\n-Hipshot (skybox)\r\n-Legobro\r\n-3z\r\n-Jeeves\r\n-Pandora\r\n\r\nAnd many others who helped throughout the making.\r\n\r\nTHis map has a similar layout to dustfun, since its easy and well played.\r\n\r\nThis map is 100% made by me.\r\n</fieldset>\r\n\r\n<fieldset>\r\nLike this map?
