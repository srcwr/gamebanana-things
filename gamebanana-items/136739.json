In the middle are 4 holes 2 are blue 2 are red drop down the red to get to the bottom and go up the blue to get to the top. on each side of the map there is a staircase to go up and down as well. have fun guys!\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all who helped and tested with me, I appreciate the help very much and thank you all for your ideas. Without you guys this map wouldn't have been possible =)"
