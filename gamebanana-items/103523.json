From there on, you can jump to shore or stick to the ships.\r\nThere are 2 bomsites in the map. One in the bar at the middle, and one at the porch of the CT building.\r\n\r\nAll suggestions are welcome, and if you notice anything wrong with it, please let me know so I can fix it. \r\n\r\n*NOTE*\r\n\r\nFixed the damn door... I could have swore I made it a func_detail already.\r\nSorry for the inconvinience."
