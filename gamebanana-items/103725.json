	"_sText": "This map, de_rio, is a medium-small bomb defuse map for CS:S.  The A bomb site is inside a building with a simple layout but many approaches.  The B bomb site is on a dock with shallow water underneath.\r\n\r\nI have a <a href=\"http://www.jamesjenista.com/de_rio.php\">detailed page for this map</a> at my personal website with design notes, annotated screen shots and video of me running around in the map.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you like it or want to see something get changed.\r\n\r\n<edit>\r\nSomething I forgot to add is that the map looks like garbage in HDR.  I didn't realize my skybox and lighting was all tuned for LDR so I suggest playing it in LDR only."
