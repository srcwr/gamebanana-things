I think its pretty close to the original, as it stands now it has 2 spawns 1 for each team.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone cares to take the time to finish it feel free, I just thought it was a good start most of the brush work is done, just needs to be textured and weapons/buyzones added.\r\n\r\nI think this map may be a better fightyard map, but i suppose that would be up to the final author :)\r\n\r\nHope someone can finish this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a note: this map was not intended to be a \"dev texture\" map, i use dev textures in the early processes of my maps, its easier to nodraw that way :D\r\n"
