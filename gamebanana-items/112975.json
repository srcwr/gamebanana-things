MAP MADE BY ROGUEGUY AND MEANING_IN_TRAGEDY***\r\n\r\nThis map is a fightyard map, but it has many many twists!\r\n\r\nThe Terrorists spawn in the main garage and the Counter-Terrorists spawn in the office.\r\n\r\nThere are MANY secrets in this map (About 20), that I have fully explained in the README.txt that comes with the map. I won't spoil them, but the secrets range from...\r\n\r\n- Cars coming through walls\r\n- Buttons that reveal hidden weapons\r\n- Explosions\r\n- Hidden ladders\r\n- A jail (with a fun button on the outside :)\r\n-Things falling out of ceilings (Just to scare you :)\r\n-Floors that rot out when you step on them\r\n\r\nThat is just a preview of the secrets on this map :)\r\n\r\nThere are also 2 vent systems, one on the ground and one on the ceiling, that have holes in them for you to snipe out of.\r\n\r\nMe and Meaning_In_Tragedy really worked hard on this map, and we hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n~Another quality map by the |SS| Clan~\r\nwww.thessclan.com\r\n"
