Don't worry.\r\n\r\nIt could be the last one of these types of maps stormy hilly maps using that 3d skybox.\r\nI don't know what I will try to make next.\r\nWell this map took ages to compile. (I don't know why)\r\nThe day version totally sucked so sorry if you wanted a day non storm version. \r\n\r\nI hope you like it."
