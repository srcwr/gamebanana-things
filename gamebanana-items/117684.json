	"_sText": "There are many weapons on the ground, ump's and mac10's at the spawns.  There is an outer-circle, where player's spawn, a mid-way circle which is nothing special, and a inner-circle where there are teleport's which take the player's to the top floor.  On the base floor cover is provided by block-like things in the ground.  On the top, there are tall structures which a player can run into, their are long glass bridges leading to those structures.  This map is pretty big (about 4048x4048).  This is the third map i've made.  PM me for request's.\r\n\r\nYou may not re-release this map elsewhere!"
