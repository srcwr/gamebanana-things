A little cutscene will pop up, after that, exit the server and CS:S. After that, you open it again and it should work.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I went on a LAN and some of the people that were there downloaded this map, typed \"buildcubemaps\", but when they made a server out of it, others couldn't join. If you don't know how to fix this, don't type in the code, because it works without it.\r\n___________\r\nPM if it's a bug, or you wanted to ask about something.\r\n\r\n2012 edit; This was made for some large LAN I was attending to, I also made it because PoolParty was my favorite map and I thought map-making was cool. It was just for fun :)"
