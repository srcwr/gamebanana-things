(on here that is.) It's been a really fun experience to add to my collection and I don't regret a bit of it.\r\n\r\nAbout the map...\r\n------------------\r\nThe map itself isn't too long, and I'd say ranged for the moderately experienced Bhopper. I tried to make it look as appealing as possible, and really set a nice mood for every snow fan to enjoy. I didn't use any regular snow textures just because I thought it looked silly, so I decided to use the bland dev texture, and add special interest to the snow around all the checkpoints with lights and other goodies. Oh, and there's also a song on a moderate volume to accompany you."
