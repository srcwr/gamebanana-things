	"_sText": "An excellent take on Goldeneye/Perfect Dark Facility. Good for close quarters combat with plenty of vents and hidey holes.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the readme, there are a few known but insignificent bugs, being that a light in the sewer is not attatched to the wall and the Bots for Terrorist do not leave their spawn level."
