	"_sText": "Here's the deal first you choose your primary weapon which is randomised then pick up your pistol . You will then get teleported into a glass tube with panes of glass (aren't they pretty) you must destroy them with your gun as you fall and pick up speed to make it to the floor safely or you can try to kill your enemy through the tubes but that could be a big mistake as YoU may end up dying and the same goes gfor helping teamates. Once on the floor you loose all your weapons and it becomes an h.e arena the grenades are atop the large pane seperating terrorists and counter terrorists. If you would like to end your enemies early there is an awp awiating pickup if they try to be sneaky and pick up a tmp and you are fast enough you can blow the block out and they land into a pit of circular saws  (Don't try to find a flaw because you will die)(thanks to Ryau for immense help with triggers)"
