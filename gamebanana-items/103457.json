	"_sText": "*********************************\r\n\r\n The original de_paris map received very favourable reviews, and became quite popular, particularly in France.  There were some issues with framerate in certain parts of the map, and hence this highly optimized version was developed.   The lighting in the metro has also been redone, as well as some other  minor changes in certain places.  We hope you enjoy this new, high FPS version of de_paris_opt!!    \r\n\r\n*********************************\r\n\r\n-------\r\nPARIS\r\n-------\r\nBomb defusion map.\r\n-----------------\r\nMap Created by ATF_RealSeal\r\nmapping_predator@hotmail.com\r\n-----------------\r\nOptimized by Swift\r\n-----------------\r\n5th June 2008\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nVersion:  de_paris_opt (OPTIMIZED)\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\n--------\r\nTerrorists have occupied an area of Paris, and want to cause as much destruction as possible. Their primary target is the famous cafe \"Les Deux Magots\", and their backup plan is to blow up the Abbesses Metro station.\r\n\r\nInspired by the Euopean-feel of cs_italy, and also the fantastic gameplay of de_dust2. The dimensions are almost exactly the same as those of de_dust2, and the layout shares some similar elements. \r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n-----------\r\n- Intelligent nav file \r\n- Radar overview map\r\n- Fully immersive ambience\r\n- Custom models, textures, soundscape, 3D skybox\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n----------\r\nMap by ATF_RealSeal (aka S.E.A.L. #555, aka Predulus, aka A.o.F).  Optimization by Swift.\r\n\r\nThanks to Ralph Van Hoorn for optimizing help, Ltk and members of clans S013 and REAL for testing, Dave Johnston (Author of Dust and Dust2) for feedback. CFoust for helping me with a sound problem. My wife for putting up with me mapping all the time.\r\n\r\nFUN: \r\n-------\r\n- Try killing the Crows. They're hard to hit.\r\n- You can also press the \"USE\" key on the i-Pod.\r\n- See if you can find the secret sounds and passageways\r\n- Items of special interest may be the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower."
