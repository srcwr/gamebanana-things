	"_sText": "A re-creation of the infamous map The Complex that stars in GoldenEye and PerfectDark on the Nintendo 64. This is a map I made back in 2002 for the first CounterStrike and Death Match games, and have updated it to CounterStrike Source and DeathMatch Source.   This is the CounterStrike version of the map and is a complete with mini-map, HDR lighting, fine tuned bot nav mesh, and graffiti! The map is a perfect recreation in it's spatial sense and to scale of the original. In play it's fast paced and exciting, from my testing it's fairly balanced.<br><br>&nbsp;Sadly I didn't use textures from the game as I did for the first version of the map for CounterStrike 1.5. Maybe in a future release, yeah I was too lazy to make the new vtf textures for it, but I will get to it.<br><br>Please let me know of any issues or criticism or requests you may have. If you're hosting on a server please let me know so I can join in. Thanks.<br><br><br><br>"
