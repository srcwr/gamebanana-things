If anyone out there has a decent computer and can compile this map again for me, i can easily work out a newer version.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- When starting the boat, it sometimes kills players inside of it when exiting the dock, once its away from the dock, its fine.\r\n\r\nHopefully ill get some more maps up in the future, hope ya'll like it!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nPenguiin\r\nD-FENS\r\nand all available prefabs and whatnot included in this map"
