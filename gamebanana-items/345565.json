With a two week deadline the map was kinda rushed but turned out better than expected, I did however want to add some bonuses and release the map for real after the competition was over...  <br>  <br>Now here it is 6 months later ????  <br>  <br><ul><li>tier: 1  </li><li>stages: 2  </li><li>bonuses: 3  </li></ul>  <br>It turns out i forgot to build cubemaps (resulting in no reflections) but I don't wanna recompile it. Hookzones are there and should be good. Map looks better with hdr on but you do you."
