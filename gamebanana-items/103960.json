	"_sText": "After the Keystone Space Ship launch has been confirmed, international terrorists have tracked the location of the Launch site and have been secretly moving chemical elements inside the facility. The facility is a Freight Shipping Company that has been hired to host the launch secretly. Counter Terrorists forces tracked the movement and deployed a CT team to the site. The Launch however, is in 10 hours, leaving the facilities crew to prep the ship for launch. The Terrorists, make their move and silence the facility before CT forces arrive. The CT forces are to eliminate the Terrorist Group and to defuse any explosives before a chain reaction occurs and destroys the ship. The objective of the terrorist is to plant the explosives and/or eliminate the CT force."
