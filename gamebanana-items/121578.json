Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n**ALSO**\r\nThere seems to be something wrong with the map file showing up this error:\r\n\r\n\r\nDataTable warning: (class player): Out-of-range value (xxxx.xxxx) in SendPropFloat 'm_vecVelocity[1]', clamping.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm still fairly new to mapping and don't know what the problem is but if it is something that can be fixed I will fix it if there's another version.\r\n"
