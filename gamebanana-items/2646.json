I wait assesments, sugestion ideas or just a point a view.\r\nI will try to release the other vehicles to but im still working on the interiors.\r\n<b><font color=\"red\">NOTES: Just copy the camo folder to the materials folder...\r\nEx: D:\\Games\\Counterstrike:source\\cstrike\\materials.\r\nDont forget to give credits\r\n****End transmison****"
