	"_sText": "This is a combat/linear surf I made.\r\n\r\nYou start off on a glass platform floating in the sky. It Breaks. You fall down onto the surf and you surf to get guns. People who fall in jail get a knife and a he grenade. After some amount of time you are released back onto the surf. The higher you surf the better guns you get. Lots of weird surfing and other stuff, so yeah, have fun and don't forget to kill people.\r\n\r\n64 players\r\n32 T\r\n32 CT\r\n________________________________\r\nNotes\r\n-------\r\n\r\n-I made it so DM servers can now play this map, no fall damage triggers last forever so when you spawn you will be no fall damage-afied.\r\n-Tested it on 66 tic. Not sure how it will play on 33 tic or 100 tic. Don't ask.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n---------\r\nCredits\r\n---------\r\n\r\nLoller Dan - Creator\r\nKaratek√§fer - Custom Skybox Texture\r\n\r\nSolid Surf Studio for teaching me almost everything I know about mapping.\r\n________________________________\r\n-------\r\nFixes\r\n-------\r\n\r\n-Fixed some lighting issues.\r\n-Fixed the top of jail.\r\n-Fixed random dieing. For real this time.\r\n-Fixed jail teles so t's go one side and ct's go to the other."
