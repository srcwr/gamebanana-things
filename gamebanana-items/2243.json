Don't feel like making a readme, not much to explain :P.\r\n\r\nI added a demo (Only way I could find out to make a video :P) and put it in the rar file just for kicks. so if you wanna see it in game but dont feel like testing it just open console in game and type startdemos woodentower, after you add it into the right file. I also added a bsp file so if you want to try it out you don't have to go through the work of compiling it. *Note* Don't bother extracting the BSP or Demo anywhere if you don't want to use 'em. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy! :D"
