	"_sText": "In this map I used all refectivity textures. But by making the lighting in areas different I was able to combine colors of lights to make this map truly colorful and give it sort of an alien look to it. \r\n\r\nThis map has 50 spawn points, although I wouldn't reccomend playing with that many because you'll have blockage all over the place, but you can if you really want to. I did include buy zones for both teams so you can get any weapon you want. \r\n\r\nThis map would also work great for gungame.\r\n\r\nPlease try my map and assess it. Thank you!"
