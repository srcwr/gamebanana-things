	"_sText": "fy_blocker\r\n\r\nThis is my first fight yard map, and third completed map made with Valve Hammer Editor. It has 32 spawns, but I recommend to play this with maximum of 16 players because map is quite small. Layout is simply 4 boxes with a cross middle of those boxes. Theme is fictional. Workers and foremen of those factories have left lots of graffitis and paintings into walls.\r\n\r\nMap includes:\r\n-Spotlights\r\n-Custom decal Graffitis made by myself & Custom sign decals\r\n\r\n\r\nThere should be no bugs. If you face one please report it. Comments and improvements are also very welcome. All custom content was made by myself, and they are my property. Do not edit or repost this map. If you use this map on publice server please post here your server's name and IP-adress. Do this because I would like to come check out this map in bigger games how it works.\r\n\r\nAll custom files are packed with pakrat. The rar-file includes both bsp. ( fy_blocker.bsp ) and custom content ( fy_blocker.bsp.bak ) files. They both go to maps folder.\r\n\r\nSorry of my bad english :/ , and remember to rate and comment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
