	"_sText": "A luxurious Newport Beach mansion is being attacked by an anti-capitalist terror unit intent on bombing it to the ground.\r\nThey have specified two vulnerable targets - the walkway on the cliffside or the upstairs bathroom at the rear of the house. \r\n\r\nThis map is perfect for around 12 players, but supports up to 56 for a full scale house war. It is fast paced, with several different routes encouraging tactical play."
