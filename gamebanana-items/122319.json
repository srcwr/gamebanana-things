With his permission, I created my own up to date version...\r\n\r\nDue to such a large map file size, I'm pretty sure you have to use a sv_downloadurl to distribute from your server. \r\n\r\nWhat caused the large map file? \r\n-the usage of shapes, geometry. \r\n-compiling with RAD, makes the map look better\r\n\r\nNo leaks what so ever, I am 100% sure of that.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n--Buck"
