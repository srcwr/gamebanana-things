That's for a reason.\r\n\r\nThird, yes! It's not only just a gun game map! You too can enjoy it on your Standard CSS Sever!\r\n\r\nIt's got buyzones and bombsites -- all the essentials for a standard detonation map, and with custom textures!\r\n\r\nI know it's a little trippy -- it's different. Why not give it a try? \r\n"
