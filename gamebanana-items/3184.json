	"_sText": "This is a rotating door like in many Department stores or office blocks.\r\n\r\nThere are two of them in this prefab, one rotates in the oposite direction to the other so if you want an entrance and exit door then you can. \r\nAlso I have added basic lighting to one of the doors to allow for many uses in darkness or light.\r\n\r\nAll the textures are default and no other file is required. Any changes made to this Prefab are allowed as long as credit is given. \r\n\r\nThere are probably other similar to this but as with all Maps and Prefabs its best to have a little variety.\r\n\r\n"
