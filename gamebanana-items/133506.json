	"_sText": "the map is simple there isn't much to it it. I wanted to create a fun gungame level that wouldnt just satisfy gameplay and Design although i use a small range of textures i try to make up for the Devs with Decals and Props laid out to create walls and Barriers and little focal points to look at.\r\n\r\ni have tested it out with my friends and it is Good fun it is small simple and a very easy layout to get used to and with 2 main textures Design shouldnt be to distracting from actual gameplay. very fast paced and energetic.\r\n\r\nThis is my first 3D skybox which i just copied from the Sdk tutorial map as i had no idea what would look good with the Strange and weird world that icreated. so i thought that the obscure big buildings and walls would fit well.:D"
