	"_sText": "Welcome to Ka_LeetKnivez!!\r\n\r\nThis was an idea a while back and I finally got bored enough to put a good amount of work into it.  Being that it is a Knife Arena map, there is only so much I could do to make it the best it could be.\r\n\r\nTexture scheme:  I know a lot of you will consider my choice of textures to be a bit bland and/or boring, but I chose them for a reason...  The main scheme is based off of the classic surf map, Surf_leet_xl.  The metal textures in that map are implemented through out and I thought it would make a cool theme.  Then again, this is my own personal choice, and as I stated earlier, I'm sure some will disagree with my choices.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, there are 32 spawn points altogether, so you can have a pretty big knife-fest.\r\n\r\nNotes:  There are two sections you can spawn from.  One of the two sections for each side (T and CT) have boosters to the center platform.  Additionally, there is another set of boosters on the center platform back to the spawn points that don't have boosters from the beginning.  I thought it would change game play a bit and make things a little more fun then just running around and trying to knife people who are running away.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n:Gaiy-Psycho:"
