Here is an FY version of the map with buyzones:\r\nhttp://www.gamebanana.com/maps/155097\r\n\r\nConceived and built in 3 days. HDR ready, cubemaps done, bot nav edited- some issues with bots climbing to top level of tower. Thanks to those at KZMOD.com for teaching me the importance of adding details. Thanks to gamebanana for all the tutorials available.\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments, bugs, suggestions. Enjoy and load a finished, detailed map on your GG server!\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions:\r\nExtract .bsp and .nav files to the following directory:\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\[YOUR USERID]\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps"
