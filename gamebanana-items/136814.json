It's been rebuilt almost from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe original was really inefficient. Lots of brushes inside brushes, overlapping brushes and missing textures. I thought the idea had promise, and I like Maya architecture and culture, so I decided to remake it.\r\n\r\nEl Castillo is Spanish for \"The Castle\". It's the nickname given to the Temple of Kukulcan in the Maya city of Chichen Itza in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMost of the textures and decals were modified or created by myself. Many of them are actual Maya symbols or patterns, but they were placed at random in the map and don't really mean anything.\r\n\r\nThe teleport inside the pyramid teleports you to one of the 4 corners on top of the building at random, so camping the teleport destinations should be difficult.\r\n\r\nThe original version of the map is more realistic, but this version should be faster, smoother and generally more fun.\r\n\r\nYes, you can shoot through the star in the floor/ceiling, but you cannot break it. :)\r\n\r\nCheers to PresumedDead who made the original gg_elcastillo!\r\n\r\nStOo (<a href=\"http://www.betaneutral.com\">www.betaneutral.com</a>)\r\n\r\nThanks for playing!\r\n03.07.2007"
