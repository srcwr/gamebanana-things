Both teams has samekind areas, only defference is ground, and the areas are mirrored, not rotated.\r\n\r\nThere is invisible wall, so you cant rush ;) (LIE!!!)\r\n\r\nHope you like it =]\r\n\r\nThe wall in center must be shot 3 times with awp, or 4-6 times with deagle.\r\nThis wall is there because i hate spawn killers :)\r\n\r\nHere is the darker version (night) of this map. Some water added too..\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/45860\">awp_minicastle_night</a>"
