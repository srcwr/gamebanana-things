	"_sText": "This map consists of four rooms.  There is a main room consisting of two houses and two climbing areas.  Both houses contain secrets.  On opposite ends of the main room there is a red tunnel, and a blue tunnel.  Each tunnel leads to one of the spawns, which consists of a small shack.\r\n\r\nThe final room is through a green tunnel from the main room, behind one of the climbing areas.  This is a model of a house I actually lived in.  There are also a few secrets in the house, as well as two pathways that lead to the attic.  The map was originally dark, but I've changed the lighting on it.\r\n\r\nThis map should be pretty decently balanced.  It is currently in the map rotation of the .zH. clan server.  If you'd like to check it out, visit 206.123.125.38:27016 and ask an admin to switch to that map."
