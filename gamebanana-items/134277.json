	"_sText": "Gg_courtyard_v2_ggn\r\n========\r\nWas my submission for ggn mapping competition but i decided i loved the map and upgraded it. Yet this upgrade was not in the time constraint of the contest.\r\n========\r\nFeatures a office like oval with a beautiful courtyard center. Multiple trees in large beds act as cover. A semi-destroyed pathway lines the way across the courtyard. Breakable windows. Buy zone.\r\n========\r\nv2:\r\nHallways now have more cover and access to the rooftop. Fixed some of the displacements of the map that block you somehow, and prevented gameplay. Fixed some floating boxes. Added extra detail. Made the map much brighter. Added a soundscape of birds chirping. Changed the tree beds to semi-rough."
