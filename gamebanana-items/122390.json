(I luv it ^^)\r\n\r\nfurthermore I want to say thanks to Sangre, Absolute and Kabo for their special help with finding bugs and beta testing.\r\n\r\nthe map:\r\n\r\nit is a linear surf map and has 1 Bonus\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\nwhen the players are spawned there is a pre timer which forgives every fail the first minute. After that minute you will get teleported to Jail after every fail.\r\nIf you are in Jail you can look up: there is another timer which teleports everyone in Jail back to spawn every 30 seconds.\r\nAfter another 4 minutes (with pre timer 5 minutes) the \"jailback\" timer stops and you will not get back to spawn again.\r\n\r\nBonus:\r\nThe Bonus has a counter at the beginning. It counts the fails of 1 team. 1 team is allowed to fail 7 times (after the 7 fails every fail will teleport you to jail)\r\nThere is a secret button which can reset the fail counter ONE time for ONE team.\r\n\r\nThere are several secrets in the map. I hope you enjoy finding them ^^\r\n\r\nBeta testers:\r\n- RyanS\r\n- Helix\r\n- Swat\r\n- Billy\r\n- Skar\r\n- Blacky\r\n- Evening\r\n- Fuddy\r\n- Konfix\r\n- Compact\r\n- Merlin\r\n- 8bit\r\n- Schoberus\r\n- Sangre\r\n- Tetra\r\n- Kabo\r\n- Chefkochmaps\r\n- Absolute\r\n- Bravesurf\r\n\r\nHere is a Video by Blacky:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"660\" height=\"405\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UOmi0rh3QRA&hl=de_DE&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UOmi0rh3QRA&hl=de_DE&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"660\" height=\"405\"></embed></object>\r\nThanks mate :D\r\n\r\nAnd here a secret video by me:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"660\" height=\"405\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Cm49LEUHH3s&hl=de_DE&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Cm49LEUHH3s&hl=de_DE&fs=1&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"660\" height=\"405\"></embed></object>\r\n:p\r\n"
