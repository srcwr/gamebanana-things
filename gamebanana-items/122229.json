	"_sText": "surf_gust created by Gobanzo Mon\r\n(gobanzo_mon@yahoo.com)\r\n\r\nGust is a clean looking, moderately difficult, surf map. Most of the acton takes place on the main slopes at the beginning which gives the players their speed. The have the choice to spread off any many directions while along the main path. Platforms can be found outside the main path with weapons on them. Each platform has a teleporter to lead the player to the \"top\" where they can go to either spawn point.\r\n\r\n The teleporters at the end can dramatically boost a players speed if hit directly. They'll be teleported back to the beginning and a \"gust\" of wind can lift a player to the upper level slopes where a sniper platform can be found.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, gust is better looking than most surf maps out there."
