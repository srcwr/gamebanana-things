I wanted to play snow, but found that every other css version was either not the right size, too different, or had some unfortunate problem.\r\n\r\nSo this is my take on the classic - and besides the look, it is totally faithful to the original. The graphics are purposely simple (but not lacking by any means!) to ensure optimal performance with many players on-screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n<fieldset><font size=\"4\">Features</font></fieldset>\r\n<ul><li>super-optimized for performance, although still decent looking\r\n<li>weapons use the EXACT placing from the original\r\n<li>the weapon set is the same as the original\r\n<li>the size is as close to the original as possible\r\n<li>all weapons spawn with ammo\r\n<li>low gravity play works great.\r\n<li>snowing effect looks correct\r\n<li>there's an overview radar, and a NAV file\r\n<li>one difference from the original: there's no body armor. But, AWPers didn't need the armor anyway, and there's no good way to put armor on the ground in css.\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAll custom content is made by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/103053\">Dr. Spud</a> and may not be re-used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<fieldset><legend>More by <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/members/103053\">Dr. Spud</a></legend>\r\nCheck out my bomb/defuse map,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/28393\"><font size=\"4\">de_glacier</font></a>\r\n\r\nAnd for another fight yard map, try out my brand-new map,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/75639\"><font size=\"4\">fy_highrise_09</font></a>\r\n\r\n</fieldset>"
