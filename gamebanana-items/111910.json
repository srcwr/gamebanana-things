	"_sText": "This was originally going to be called dm_docks but I changed it to fy_crateyard because it was to small to be dm and was'nt docklike enough to be docks.\r\n\r\nThere are two rooms.  Cover is provided by all the crates.  There are two awps, two p90s, two fivesevens, and some grenades in the storage cabinets in each room.  This map was inspired by one of the maps in fear.  I'll upload more screenshots later.  \r\n\r\nPlease post any suggestions."
