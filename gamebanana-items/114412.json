	"_sText": "Here is my try for the main hall of the Spencer Mansion. I tried to make it as original and as good looking as possible, but since the source engine has its limitations, I could not add reflections, lightning effects nor some of the geometry without it completely soaking up the FPS. \r\n\r\nSince the map is quite small, I thought that the fight yard type would suit this map perfectly. Each player start off with a knife within close proximity of the enemy in different parts of the hall. Weapons can be found on key objects, drawers, chairs etc. just like in the game."
