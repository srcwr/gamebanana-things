On the Table are a Game how were played in Germany. The Name from the Gamme is \"Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht\". I have add diverent Thinks on the Table like a Handy or Dices. There are all Weapons in the Map, the most are on the Player Spawns. Some Weapons like the Scope Weapons or the Nades are on the Table, find it. I have add 4 Health Packs, they gives you 25 HP back. I have create a lot of costum Textures for this Map. In have add the Nav File in the Pack too, so you can play with 31 Bots if you like. I hope you like the Map. \r\n\r\nOur skillor"
