	"_sText": "This is a map that will work in regualr CS:S, but it is meant for 4HM's Gun Game Mod. It is a very fast paced map. I beta tested it with the WTF clan from theserverspot.com and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The people that like it loved it and those that complained... well lets just say they were the ones that were -12-20. The fans push you up to the next level and I have fixed them so they dont push you too high. You can also jump from the top level onto the fan of the bottom level and coast down to the bottom floor slowly. Everyones FPS ran from 50-70 and I have since done some optimizing which boosted the fps by 15-30. Hope everyone enjoys this map and if there are any bugs you find PM me. Look for the release of my next map wtf_toohigh which utilizes a new combination of triggers that so far though beta testing has lead to some awsome game play."
