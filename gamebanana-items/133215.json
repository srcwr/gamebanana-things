TY!<br><br>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_cMIr2SAcw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br><br>\r\n\r\nFirst thing! The map is not dark!<br><br>\r\n\r\nI wanted to remake Texture City Advance and keep it original feel to that map and few rooms inside the map without expanding it out of making it bigger. \r\nTo explain  better:<br>\r\nI saw the map was big already, so I instead add more rooms inside the map or this case a small city. The purpose was to make it feel more of a city and I didn't want to add whole bunch sounds. I only added one and you can't hear it until your standing 5 ft next to it. That way you can hear what is around you and the sound is very low, even if your standing under/top of the sound.<br><br>\r\n\r\nColors:<br>\r\nI add the most popular colors in clans.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe most popular clans have Red, black, and white.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI am not going to name them off, because advertising is breaking GameBanana's rules.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso I choose these colors, because it attracts gamers and many gaming companies use these three colors.<br>\r\nAgain, not saying what companies, because of the site rules against advertising.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the map and love it in your clan or non-clan severs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLet me know if there any troubles of the map, Because I want my map perfect.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThank You!<br><br>\r\n\r\nMadCow777"
