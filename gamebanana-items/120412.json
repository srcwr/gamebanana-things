The objective of the game is to dodge the falling blocks as well as stay on the floor without falling into the pit of death. As the map goes on, many blocks fall from the sky, knocking out the floor, which balances on pillars. You start as a terrorist without a weapon, and you will need to put this command if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nmp_limitteams 100\r\n\r\nThere isn't really a way to actually win, but I guarantee you that you will have fun anyways. Thanks to the author of the Revox textures for making my maps look sexy :D.\r\n\r\nI have it up and running in my server if you want to try it out .\r\n[db] 24/7 Fun maps |16 slot|Noblock|\r\n64.34.171.198:27015\r\n\r\nPlease comment if you like it and rate it :)."
