We made this but just not looking as nice and using alot of prefabs. \r\n5 months later i make it look good so i can put it on fpsb. My clan also loved playing it. \r\n\r\nCome to me if you find any bugs.\r\n\r\nStory: In the lands of css, de_dust. A place bombed by terrorist's is about to get bombed. After getting bombed the last time the small village in the dessert of de_dust got together and started building. Now the terrorist's have came again to bomb it and all the supply's. Killing alot of the people. The counter terrorist's heard of this plan and have got to the village just in time.\r\nNow its your turn to carry on. Your turn to tell the villages future.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nMap: Drimp\r\nFixing error: Crazypip, Lost\r\noptimize: Crazypip\r\n\r\nThanks all that helped and good luck, have fun.\r\n\r\n'Drimp'"
