	"_sText": "The cs_varasto_bysleepy is a fast paced map, wich is very easy to learn. The CTs are attacking to a warehouse seized by the terrorists, the terrorists also have captured some of the warehouse workers.\r\n\r\nThis map is great for small battles due to it's small size. But it also is good for big battles. The rounds are usually very fast and full of action. CTs have to move from their spawn quickly or they will get pinned down by the terrorists.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 routes to the warehouse. First and Second are through the warehouse's loading platform. The third route is through a dark tunnel wich is a good way to sneak to the terrorist's back, but if you're spotted in the tunnel you will easily get killed because there is little cover in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nPS. This is my first map to be uploaded so be gentle :D"
