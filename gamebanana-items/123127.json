I touched up on quite a lot of the levels just to improve the fps and make it look a little bit better.\n\nI made stage 2 and 4 a little bit harder because they were way to easy.\n\nAlso, I am sorry to say this, but I had to remove the jails.. There were so many bugs in them, I had no other option. Sorry striker/vestax&lt;3\n\nSendspace link: http://www.sendspace.com/file/mkoo4d"
