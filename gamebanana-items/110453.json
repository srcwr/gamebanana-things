	"_sText": "It's not much yet.. I've really only just started.. but I wanna get an idea of what people think of the nets.\r\n\r\nThis is an edit of fletch's indoor map (with his permission).. so far basically what i've changed is:\r\nNo crowds, there's things like restrooms and vending machines instead (not complete yet), New soccer nets,\r\nChanged a few other textures, the outer stadium is now made of white bricks (dunno if that's weird but that's how it is at my sports center).\r\nAnd new green nets around the stadium, which, when you jump into them will spring and throw you back in like most indoor nets do.\r\nThey work both ways too, so if you noclip yourself to the other side and walk into them you'll get pushed onto the field.\r\n(could maybe make a script where the first round the player plays on the map, they have to walk through the nets to get on, for added realism)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nets have white bits around them which make them go white unless you're looking really close at them, which looks pretty ugly.. hoping to fix that in the next beta.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike most of my other soccer maps, you can't customize any settings or textures, it's just a simple copy the map on and run it."
