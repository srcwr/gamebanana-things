	"_sText": "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nThis here is gg_kotsa. It is my second released Counter-Strike: Source map. It is an edit of my previously released map scoutzknivez_nextgen. As many noted, it was more suited for GunGame, so I turned it into a gungame map!\r\n\r\nSome of the key differences between this one and the other one, is the addition of the outpost in the middle. Since GunGame doesn't have low gravity, putting in the walkways there was a way of making the map more open to players without doing impossible jumps. It also serves as cover.\r\n\r\nOther changes include lighting tweaks and various detail enhancements. These are small however.\r\n\r\nThe map is suitable for anywhere from 4 to 64 players.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think, and get out there and frag!\r\n\r\n-Dr.SharK"
