	"_sText": "<strong>For learning purposes</strong>\r\n\r\nWith the help of Rootbeerz I made a small Garden House, my first map. Inside the house is the T-spawn point. Outside the house is the Ct-Spawn. Right in front of the Ct's is a rope to the top. Also have 2 doors to access. The T's also have a rope to get to the top and both doors. Some trees and foliage outside with a nice big oak in the middle.Inside is some cases of Booze and some just basically anything a lounging T needs. It is a small map I recommend no more than 16 guys on it."
