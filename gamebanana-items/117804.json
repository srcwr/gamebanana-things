	"_sText": "Not fully done yet, but done enough to release for beta. \r\nOnly about 30 hours of work in it, mostly due to lighting errors, and model adjustments.\r\nIts a bit dark at parts, but this is on purpose. I personally enjoy a bit darker of a map, it allows for a tad bit of sneaking mixed in with the whole gun game/death match stuff."
