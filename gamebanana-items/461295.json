AFAIK, other 19 obstacles should be possible, IF you disable antiheadbug, antiedgebug and other quirks.</li></ul><br>This map tests your knowledge of Source engine with 20 small obstacles ranging from common knowledge to niche.&nbsp;Each obstacle <i>must</i> be completed by one person at a time (it probably won't break with multiple players but better safe than sorry).&nbsp;Sometimes bugs are the intended solution. Can you beat them all?<br><br>Server requirements: 100 tick, no stamina (autobhop settings), <b><span class=\"RedColor\">DISABLE RNGFIX OR SURFFIX PLUGINS!</span></b><br><br>Download the _v2 version, i kept the original for archival purposes."
