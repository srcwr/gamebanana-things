	"_sText": "Thank you for downloading gg_tesla_v2.\r\n\r\nThis map is a update on the map that had some success (which prompted me to revise it), and so I've done some modifications that should give players even more fps during play. Cell shading, which was used in the first version of this map, while nice, uses up 6 times the amount of brushfaces than normal, and this was overkill.\r\n\r\nPerfect for short range weapons, long range weapons, knifing and hegrenades.\r\n\r\nThis map also has buy-zones for anyone who wishes to have this on any non-gungame server.\r\n\r\nAll textures created by myself.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play this map on our gg server, please join us at:\r\n\r\n208.146.44.32:27015\r\n\r\nor visit us on the fourms:\r\n\r\nhttp://seattle-ducksoup.com/index.php\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n--Manqueef/Emeriastone"
