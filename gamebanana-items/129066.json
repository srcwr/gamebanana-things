	"_sText": "I made this map because I can't enduring anymore to play in a Fulbright and so ugly ba_jail maps. So I decide to make my jail map and to make it the best as I can. It took me only one week to do it. I have made the map similar to other ba_jail maps to be sure that it will respect all the jail \"rules\", I am a newbie in the jail \"mod\" ^^\r\n\r\nThere is 64 spawns ; 20 CT spawns and 44 T spawns. Many pistols and SMG are hided in the map so the CT must carefully watch what does the T ! The map height is 6.02 Mo so it's not too long to download for players. There is probably few bugs that I didn't succeed to see when I test it in my local server, so you are welcome to post it if you see one ! Suggestions and CONSTRUCTIVE critics are also welcome !\r\n\r\nThank you if you're going to upload it on your server and I hope that you will enjoy it ! ^^\r\n\r\nVERSION - 1\r\nRELEASE DATE - 15.07.2009\r\n<a href=\"http//www.biokoxomodding.tk\">http//www.biokoxomodding.tk</a>"
