	"_sText": "V2-Ok. This is a new version of the map. I re-textured the top rooms to allow more diversity between the textures of the map. So there are more different textures. I also deleted a few props to allow for better performance as well. Hope you guys enjoy the new version.  \r\n\r\nThe map consists of two sides. There is a fault in the center with a couple of inches of water. Try not to fall in or you will get hurt. If you do, there are ladders to get back up to the top. The map consists of 32 spawn points. There are 3 bridges to help you get across to each side. \r\n\r\n"
