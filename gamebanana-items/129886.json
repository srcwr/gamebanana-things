	"_sText": "------------------\r\n\r\nHeya guys!\r\n\r\n- After about a week of on and off progress, here comes an updated version of my first ever released map.\r\n\r\n- JB_MC is a Jailbreak map with the 8bit feel of Minecraft. The map includes 4 cells, each with 3 spawns, a wall, 5 secrets, pool, cafeteria, kitchen, gun toss, shot 4 shot, spray wall, and a knife pit.\r\n\r\n- Some elements that make this map unique are the Minecraft textures, the hidden secrets, the food that can be used for health, and various randomized systems. For example, each cell has a 50% chance of allowing the prisoner to go to the Rebel Way.\r\n\r\n- This map is only in an early beta. I have worked out most of the problems. In the next versions expect any fixes that are addressed, more spawns, and a 3D skybox.\r\n\r\n- The map may be pretty big because I used PakRat to include all of the sounds and textures.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n**FIXES**\r\n\r\n- Lighting!\r\n- 2 New Secrets (5 in total!)\r\n- Indoor Lighting (Breakable Glowstone!)\r\n- Bed Textures (Now aligned correctly!)\r\n- Cubemaps (Reflections!)\r\n- Cell 4 Leak\r\n- Changed Layout of CT Spawn/Stairs (allows for lighting to be added.)\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help and support through out the development process of this map. If you see ANY problems at all, don't be afraid to post a comment, PM, or EMail (my EMail is on my profile.). Again, thanks!\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://db.tt/Eq8T0EFR\"/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/members/1283185\">\r\n<img src=\"http://db.tt/iwRg358R\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://hazzardouz.tumblr.com/\">\r\n<img src=\"http://db.tt/oTF1KJEY\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazzmatt\">\r\n<img src=\"http://db.tt/KxVwbZqE\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n------------------"
