V1 is a plain under construction hotel being built with boxes still out because they were just delivered and they werent set up yet. V2,V3 etc.. will all add more things to this map. This map is pretty big so far but we will expand. What were planning to do for v2 (for a little sneak peak) is make a 4th floor in this map and maybe change the bomb sites.\r\n\r\n\r\nOK BEFORE YOU ASK READ THIS OR THE READ ME IN THE FOLDER.\r\n\r\nFor the custom materials which i only have 4 different ones, place all 3 folders I give you inside of the materials folder in cstrike."
