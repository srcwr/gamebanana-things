	"_sText": "This is a nice map for GunGame, aim training, regular, skill training, and whatever.\r\nI love this map. The colors, the shaping, the lights, it makes it kind of magic. That is why I named the map \"bluemagic\".\r\n\r\nThe map has different ways to go, and it fits sniping, close combats, SMG-wars, and so on. :)\r\n\r\nIt has two buyzones, and there are two floors; one up in the open, and one under ground, like caves, with a modern look.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of boxes and stuff to hide behind, and the spawn areas is pretty far way from each other, so no annoying, rushing newfag will take you out before you even get to by yourself a gun. The spawn areas is on the lower floor, and the spawn areas are hidden behind some boxes and walls, so when you get \"out in the air\", it's like a fog of magic and mystery is approaching you, witch is what I like about the map.\r\n\r\nThe lights makes beautiful patterns in the roof, on the walls and floor, so the map is very lovely to play.\r\n\r\nPlease send me a message if you're going to host my map on your server, I would love to play it with as many as possible!\r\n\r\nPeace out, and more nice maps will be created!\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is my first map I shown in public, so please add a comment!\r\n\r\nENJ0y!\r\n\r\nPS: I made some differenses from 1.0 :)"
