Two bunkers face each other in the middle of a suburban area, on one side of the playing field, you have a small building with an alleyway in the middle.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, a sewage pipe with a special AWP care package, on the other side, a small road and a train wreck. All the while, filled with obstacles such as cars, rocks, vending machines, and even *gasp* landmines! Watch out for those buggers, they'll take you out if you step on em.\r\n\r\nA sewer system connects each base with the pipe in the middle, which provides some intense close combat fights. Depending on your spawn point, you will recieve certain weapons upon spawning. However, if you don't like the weapon you are given, you can buy your own choice.\r\n"
