This map trys to focus on tactics & gameplay rather than visuals (though the visuals arnt bad - just not realistic).  Most of the map favors close in weapons, though there are a few areas where snipers will have a definate advantage.  \r\nEntire map is made of animating brushes (except water & sky), to give a wireframe feel to it. \r\n\r\nSize: 8976KB\r\nType: Demolition\r\nSpawns: 20 each for t's and ct's - 40 Total (Not recommended tho)\r\nAuthor: Mael!\r\nFeedback: samgilligan@gmail.com\r\n"
