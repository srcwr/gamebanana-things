Not sure if it will work on big full servers;\r\n\r\nMade the pipe on the upper right path easier to get it;\r\n\r\nFixed items glitch (they wasn't affecting everyone);\r\n\r\nMade companion cubes appear on every difficulty, not just EXTREME;\r\n\r\nMade companion cube bonuses last every round instead of just one single (bonuses are still random)."
