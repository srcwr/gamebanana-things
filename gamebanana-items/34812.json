It's a fully reworked and manually optimized .nav-file (because in original author's BSP was embedded slightly edited auto-gen NAV).<br><br>Most areas and paths were remade manually and some additional paths were created from scratch. Some broken-off important pathways were restored (in particular ways for hostages on both ladders). Also the set of other inaccuracies were corrected.<br><br>OK, bots (and hostages) have opportunity to use all walkable ways now. And they don't intend to concede to the opponent without fight ;-)<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator embedded in .bsp and available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/164503\">same map</a>.<br><br>Fight and Fun! Your responses and remarks are always welcomed :-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes:\r\nneozyem (for high detailed and very realistic urban-themed map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Never Say Die!"
