In a sense, yes it is, but I never copy pieces from the original .vmf's of the maps I remake.\r\n\r\nEverything in this map has been made from scratch using the old .vmf as a stencil/skeleton to work from.  \r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n-Optimization changes throughout the entire build/map.\r\n-Lighting/texture changes from the original\r\n-Minor aesthetic changes (my own personal wants)\r\n-Other minor tweaks that I need not be specific about.\r\n\r\nAll in all, its Breakfloor, what more could you want if your a fanatic?  I tried to stay true to the original map without ruining what everyone found amusing/fun from the older version.\r\n\r\nComments and ratings are always appreciated!!\r\n\r\nAny problems/bugs/complaints/suggestions can all be directed to:\r\n\r\nXfire: Wowyourgaiy\r\nEmail: Phantomoper3@comcast.net\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and I hope you all enjoy."
