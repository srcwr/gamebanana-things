	"_sText": "Gameplay-information: The scene of this map is a castle which has different ways to the two bombspots. One of them is great for sniping and the other is for closer combat. But any type of players gets his chance to reach both of the spots. Outdoor areas are wide and open but provide enough cover, indoor areas are smaler but you wont feel cramped.\r\n\r\nHow to install: Extract the file de_middleages.bsp into the folder &quot;<Steampath>/Steamapps/<Accountname>/Counter-Strike Source/cstrike/maps/&quot; (you can use winrar or ). The bsp-file has all used custom files included in it.\r\n\r\nLegal information: You may redistribute this map on every way you want, I don't map only for myself. Please put it on your game-servers, file-servers, homepages, cover-cds etc. but don't manipulate it or pretend that it is you work.\r\nShort: Do with it whatever you want but leave it as it is.\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n-Mail: megabauer@lycos.de\r\n-Homepage: http://www.campersclan-mapping.de.vu "
