Probably not to great to play on though, it was pretty fun with bots but when there's real players you'll probably get shot before you can get to any of the interesting areas, but it might work out, I can't say for sure as I haven't played it with real people.\r\n\r\nHere's a video of the map I took in Gmod, \r\n\r\n<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" data=\"http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=751267&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=\">\t<param name=\"quality\" value=\"best\" />\t<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" />\t<param name=\"scale\" value=\"showAll\" />\t<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=751267&amp;server=www.vimeo.com&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=\" /></object>\r\n\r\nAlso available on YouTube but it's much lower quality there, http://youtube.com/watch?v=BkbWk9O9I_w.\r\n</div>\r\n----"
