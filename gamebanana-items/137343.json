Well I'm back and I brought a nice treat for you =D. This map had been in development for about 2 months (excluding the 3 month intermissions) and I could easily tinker another 4 months on it. But I didn't. I think the map looks a bit rushed here and there, but I'm overall pleased with it and more than happy I actually finished a project for a damn change. =D\r\n\r\nOn this map every player can see trough the walls. There is no camping or no hiding. There's a slight red/blue theme on the map.\r\n\r\nThe maps has been made in such a way that if a player is to make it trough to the other team's spawn, he is rewarded by being able to go above the spawn and shoot the players that are spawing. A bit of base defense here, since the opposing team has to stop the player form doing this.\r\nThis is all theory though, since this map is beta and hasn't been play tested. Let me know what happens if you plan on adding this to your server.\r\n\r\nHow is the wallhack effect done? It's quite simple actually. All geometry you see on the screenshots is projected from the 3d skybox, which renders behind all the non-skybox-geometry. But since there are no non-skybox-geometry only the players are visible on the top layer.\r\n\r\nfeatures:\r\n- The wallhack gameplay. Being able to see players though the walls will give a unique and fast gameplay.\r\n- Soundscapes. All those hums, squeaks or hisses, it's like you're really there.\r\n- Minimap. Dont want you to get lost now would I.\r\n- 48 spawns.\r\n- Cars going by in the street. I made that with only 3 entities per car.\r\n\r\ndisadvantages to the wallhack mechanic:\r\n- no bulletholes, blood or sprays.\r\n- incorrect footstep sound.\r\n- player models are always fully lit, no matter where they stand.\r\n- no correct ambient light. I had to set it to grey or the models would look funny, but like you give a crap right? I do give one. :(\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nCould someone please tell me how to zoom in on the minimap? and/or to reduce it in size? The zoom property doesn't do anything and the giant vtf takes up half the file size. "
