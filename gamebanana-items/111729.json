I've made maps before, but this is the only map I've actually made a decent effort on.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like another version or have requests and such, feel free to let me know!\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments with constructive criticism, etc.  I'm new to FPSBanana, so I'm not really great with this kind of stuff yet.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n(P.S I want this map to become popular so upload it to your server if you'd like ^_-)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n-XantaX\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, theres a secret in the map.  I won't give it away, but here's a hint:\r\n\r\nBreakable bricks"
