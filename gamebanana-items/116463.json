	"_sText": "I am trying to start a whole new type of map set or what ever you want to call it. The new type im trying to make is PS (Pro Skills) In which that the maps are so hard because it tests a lot of the different skills you will use in a server. Some advice is to run a Death Match for the respawn or something that will respawn you. You will die a lot untill you get the hang of it. I hope you like it!!! If you want me to create another map just let me know. You can send me an e-mail at... oneshot@kokoro-no-kaze.com or go to my site and say something in the forums part. www.kokoro-no-kaze.com. Also check out the knk clan server out... 24/7 Surf Random Maps : 8.12.68.13:27015. We also have a scoutzknivez server up but it will be moving here shortly. 24/7 Scoutzknivez RPG : 216.6.229.162:27015"
