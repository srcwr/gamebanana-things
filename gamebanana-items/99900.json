The _police sends the CT force_ to rescue the hostages(in this case, the scientists)\r\n\r\nThe T's order the _scientists to create a certain chemical which makes explosives_.\r\n\r\n**_While T's protect them from the police and supply them technology, the CT's arrive in time and get armed to fight the terrorists and resuce the scientists._**\r\n\r\n**_The Environment_**\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nBirds are chirping on the tree merrily when everything is right.\r\nA pool with 2 restrooms in the middle of the map.\r\nThe Tspawn is a farmhouse.\r\nThe CTspawn is Mr.Breen's office.\r\nA subway which links the CTspawn, Tspawn and the middle of the map.\r\nA storage room in the subway.\r\nGraffiti's here and there.\r\n\r\n**_The Notes_**\r\n===============\r\n\r\n**My most detailed map as of now.

The 3D skybox was a bit of a problem as I could'nt get it right with the right textures.[the forest]\r\nA PROTIP: Press \"E\" to open the door.  xP\r\nAny problems/bugs, please comment so that I can learn from my mistakes."
