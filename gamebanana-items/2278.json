	"_sText": "Had this beauty of a map gathering dust in my sdk, so I thought, \"why not turn it into a prefab!\" In hopes of getting something out of my troubles I cleaned up what map was there and twinked here and there. The shed is also included since it looks good next to the structure. It's a two story with visible wood supports on the ceiling, and a balcony along with a small tiled room (bathroom most likely.) There are working rot door models, fully breakable glass, and plenty of room for props to really spruce the place up!  Militia was in my head during creation, so use it for a base if you like and enjoy. "
