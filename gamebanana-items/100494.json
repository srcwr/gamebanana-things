Allen(cm_allen1@yahoo.com) \r\nSPAWNPOINTS: 20 terrorist, 20 counter-terrorist, 40 total. \r\n\r\nThis is a recreation of \r\nThe Rogue Spear: Urban Operations level called the London Subway.  I also added some Vents to it, since everyone loves going through vents.\r\n\r\nI tried doing a good job of Optimizing ,Nav Tuning, and fixing snags with clipping, but I know I still have lots to learn about mapping including lighting, and etc.  So I would like to have some feedback on things to work on.\r\n\r\nA few things that I have in progress and in mind to work on are:\r\n\r\nMore Detail- Subway Signs and Banners\r\n             Dirt, Grime, and Other details to make it more \"used looking\"\r\n             Adding Props, to fill out level.\r\n             Creating Custom Textures for walls to break up that sameness.\r\n\r\nBetter Lighting\r\nBetter Optimizing\r\nBetter Nav Tuning\r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy\r\n       \r\n\r\n"
