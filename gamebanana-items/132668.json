	"_sText": "Zm_rap_zombx_b1\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nPretty much big map, many camping spots with cades and without. The map contains 2 sectors. The big sector where all spawn and other sector which you go to by teleport like a pool also with 5 platforms for camping and one secret. \r\nThe big glass building from inside with all those props look like it's unbeatable if CTs put all of those props on the stairs but there is one very easy entrance to the building on the top of it. But to reach the top you must find a secret teleport which is next to the big tower with a wooden plank above the 2 pools. If you jump straight on the opposite of the plank you will come on invisible floor, so then walk straight and it will teleport you on the top of the glass building. From there you find out your self. ;) Too much to explain.:P\r\nThe map also has many tall towers just for fun and some places on the ground. Many camping spots too.\r\n\r\nAlso it has 4 secrets, 3 in the main sector and other 1 in the pool area.\r\n--------------------------------\r\nEnjoy! ;)"
