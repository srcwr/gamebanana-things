	"_sText": "Pretty much an FY map made of dev textures with a bombsite.  The secret code for the Super secret room is 0419.  Keep it to yourself, share it, whatever.  There's a tele to the sniper box in there, that cant be seen outside, but you can see out and snipe people.  If you get the code wrong, then you go to jail.  There's an escape button, that will tele you out after 15 seconds.  The buttons on the towers will destroy the spawn kill protect glass after 30 seconds of being pressed.  Enjoy!"
