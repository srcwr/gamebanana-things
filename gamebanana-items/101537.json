The Letters \"CMD\" were made into hallways, then connected together along with\r\na few other rooms of 3 different hight levels to make a battle arena with 2 bombsites.  There are many different \r\nroutes to get around the map.  This version is kind of plain, and was put together to test game play.  A later version\r\nmay be in the works, that will include a theme more detail, and some repairs to brush work.  \r\n\r\nfeatures:  \r\n\r\n2 bombsites\r\nbuyzones\r\nmini map overview\r\nan easter egg or two"
