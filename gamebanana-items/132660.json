For those who haven't seen my earlier versions this is a dark map thats not to big.  But it's a real fun map to play.  It depends where the majority of people is for zombies to win or loose.  Though it's not a running map its a camping map.  Build your barricades before...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLASH YOUR DEAD!\r\n\r\nEnjoy this map and read the change log/instructions for more detail."
