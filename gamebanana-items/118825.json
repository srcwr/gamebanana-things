The hole will open if you destroyed the wooden target.\r\nOn the left side theres a timer. You'll die if you need to long.\r\n\r\nOn the last Part (5th), if you destroyed the wooden target, a new target will come, which looks red, I think you'll see it. Just hit it once and a Text will come.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one player can play. The others will have no weapon.\r\nONLY TERRORISTS!\r\nMax. 8 Players.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess there are some Bugs, please let me now.\r\n\r\nIt's the Alpha!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy english isn't the best - sry.\r\n"
