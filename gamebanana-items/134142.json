I could be wrong to think that but I'm open for suggestions. <br /><br />\r\nThanks to <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/members/138831\">Karatefer</a> for the gorgeous <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/textures/142\">skybox</a>.<br /><br />\r\nPS: I mentioned in a WiP that i would credit sgt_kick_ur_ass for his rotating fan prefab but I failed to get it to work so it just ended up being the fan from prodigy (Not sure if that still requires credit or not)."
