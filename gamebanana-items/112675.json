I encourage you to go over and take a look at it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/110135\r\n\r\nAnyway, this took me a day and a bit to create and troubleshoot. It works pretty well with bots, with a slightly altered navigation mesh.\r\n\r\nPlease do give me relevant feedback. This is my first proper release, so tips are very welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANKYOU!"
