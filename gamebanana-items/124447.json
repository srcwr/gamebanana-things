(end music is still alive (glados) just thought it would be fun)\r\ncan be that ive pakratted some not needed stuff cuz it was bugging before, but ill check it to final atleast so all whats pakked is also needed.\r\n\r\nMap haves color correction but no HDR (yet?)\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThats all what came to mind now. maybe ill write some more some other day.\r\n\r\nPlease report all buggs if u find any.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso all kind of ideas are wellcome.^^\r\n\r\nMap by Silent Assassin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncake is a lie. =P\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbtw my opinion about portal is that its great game, but cause its kinda puzzle game it should be harder. Ive heared that portal 2 is much harder so i cant wait until its released. =)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank you helping us help you help us all\" ;D"
