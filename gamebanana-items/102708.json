This attention is, in part, expressed by very detailed brushwork, soundscapes, a 3D-skybox and, new in this release, HDR.\r\nThe maps setting is, as the name suggests, some industrial estate which is laid out for a maximum of 20 players, while still creating an intense gaming experience for smaller amounts of players."
