	"_sText": "This map was originally made by Moo,\r\nand is released here with his permission.\r\nIt' s a nice remake of the oldschool\r\nzm map zm_crazycity_b2.\r\nWe added some new rooms to fill in some\r\nof the old buildings, which used to have\r\nnothing inside.  We also added an\r\nunderground area and put clips on high,\r\nunreachable areas to prevent players\r\nfrom getting to them with propmenu.\r\nAlso, the map has been optimized and has\r\nvery high FPS.  It has 66 spawnpoints,\r\nso it's good for 50+ player Servers."
