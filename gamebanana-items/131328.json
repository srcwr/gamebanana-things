	"_sText": "This is a map that I created, the idea was to create something a bit different in looks, little bit abstract but focus mainly on gameplay, balance and fps.\r\nIts a small to medium sized map and I hope that it will have fast rounds with lots of action.\r\nI don't like big maps as there is a lot of waiting around and its boring.\r\nSmall maps mean the action is never too far away.\r\nI don't like maps with massive detail as this becomes laggy when you have a server with many players, the maps made for hunting, not only zombies to hunt humans but for humans to hunt zombies.\r\nThe camp spots are pretty easy for zombies to get to, no tube or stupid vents, only places where teamwork wins."
