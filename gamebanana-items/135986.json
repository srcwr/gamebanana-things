I figured this doesn't matter since most servers don't have bots. Buyzones included to prevent console errors. You can turn these off either using server cvars or by using the standard gungame settings.\r\n\r\nEnjoi.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"250\" ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/i5UdS38aGIY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/i5UdS38aGIY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"250\" ></embed></object>"
