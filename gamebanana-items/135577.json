After reading some tutorials 4 days ago, I decided to get my feet wet.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to mck-76...the original mapper of gg_lego_arena (proper credits are given in the txt file and on a textured map decal visible on the map).\r\n\r\nThe modifications include:\r\n1. Expanded the walkable surface\r\n2. The 4 blocks located in corners are now rooms\r\n3. Added tunnels in the lower level that can access the 4 rooms\r\n4. Retextured the brushes.\r\n\r\nThe black and white textures were intentionally used to depict a mafia colorization for my clan.\r\n\r\nPlease give some feedback and be critical. I know that I have a long ways to go to be a mapper.\r\n\r\nThe zip files includes the bsp, nav, txt, and gg spawnpoints."
