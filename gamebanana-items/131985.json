	"_sText": "After making (and failing) at actually \"finishing\" a map, this is the first. Took me around 3 days with a few hours out of each to finally complete.. There are some easter eggs in the map to be found.\r\n\r\n- Party Room\r\n- Teleport room\r\n- Maze room\r\n- 'Fall to your death' room\r\n- 2 \"Hidden\" spots on the walls in the main room (Camping)\r\n\r\nTeleports to these rooms are hidden underneath the midding building, underneath the slanted walkway things.. They are under those on the sides where the sofa's are. (One on each side.)\r\n\r\nTeleports 1, 2, 3 Consist of \r\n1: Takes you back to the spawn point of the map\r\n2: Takes you to the maze\r\n3: Takes you to the 'Fall to your death' room.\r\n\r\nParty room and the maze have teleports out of the rooms.. 'Fall to your death' room however doesn't. ('Cause you die, ya?)\r\n\r\nThe hidden spots are viewable by the shadows on the ground and walls. One is near the spawn point house (you need to get on top of the house to get on it) and the second is near the texture boxes at the north end of the map.\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments, suggestions for this or future maps, or any problems/bugs in the map tell me."
