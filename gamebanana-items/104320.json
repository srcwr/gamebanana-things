If you want people to be able to download the map directly from your server, you must use this command:  net\\_maxfilesize 27  Default 16mb. The Matrix map is 25mb.  Without this command changed to 27, people will download all the resources EXCEPT the .BSP and they will get an error message like \"de\\_thematrix\\_11.bsp not found\". -- If your server BZIPs the maps you're ok, but make sure you test it first.   \r\n\r\nMAP INFORMATION\r\n------------------\r\nMap Name: de\\_thematrix\\_11 Map Type: DE (Bomb/Defuse)  Release date: October 8th, 2005 Bombsites Locations: Dojo and Office (look for transparent matrix code areas on the ground) Available Weapons: Standard  Map Environment: part of a restricted system  Map Theme: The Matrix movies Map's Time of Day: Day and night  Special Features: elevator and low gravity hot spots Recommended/Maximum Players: 24/50 max Custom Textures Used: yes Custom Sounds Used: yes .NAV File Included (for bots and locations): yes Tips for this Map: \"Free Your Mind\"   \r\n\r\nA showcase video of The Matrix 1.1 can be watched here:<br>\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_midCm6vhIs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------------\r\nExtract the content of the ZIP file directly into your \"cstrike\" folder.  \".../steam/steamapps/username/counter-strike source/cstrike\"  If you previously installed any Matrix versions, overwrite everything when asked.

Thanks\r\n\r\nMAP INFORMATION FOR GEEKS:\r\n------------------\r\n- This map took me 4 months to improve, from beta 1 to beta 3, and to this version 1.1.
