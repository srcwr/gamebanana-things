(So, we are lawsuit \r\n            safe from the nanny-staters!)\r\n\r\n[6/10/07] Added some missing textures to the BSP file and updated te NAV\r\n\t  file.\r\n\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nMedium Sized Bomb Diffusal Map using various textures (thanks all authors)\r\nand scripted sequences (inclusive pseudo-random scripting to give the\r\neffect of a war zone).  The scene is inspired by my schools bookstore which\r\nis part of its main campus building, albeit not perfectly replicated.  This\r\nmap tried to be as immersing as possible.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n=================================================== \r\n\r\nConstruction\r\n\r\nGeometry : 4 weeks (approx)\r\nEntity   : 2 weeks (approx)\r\nScripting: 1 week  (approx) \r\n\r\nTotal Builtime to completion:  2 months (approx)\r\n\r\n=================================================== \r\n\r\nInstallation \r\n\r\n1.
