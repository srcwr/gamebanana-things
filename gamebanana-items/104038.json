It's horrible.<br><br>I'm just getting into the modding scene and experimenting with Hammer. <b>Even if you downright despise this map, feedback is always welcome.</b><br><b><br>Version 2 is no longer in development.<br>This is due to multiple reasons:<br>1. I don't even play CS:S that much, the only reason I made this map was for learning the basics behind Hammer.<br>2. A major bug regarding displacements was found on CT side, a bug I can't seem to fix. Every time I try to, it gets worse.<br><br>I may upload images of Version 2, but don't count on it. <br>This version of de_snowwatch however, will stay here, as it isn't as buggy/broken.<br><br></b>"
