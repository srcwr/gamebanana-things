So try to don't judge hard. This map is an remake of very-very old CS 1 map - CS_MANSION. This map was first map for CS1, and it was the prototype for CS_ESTATE. In CSS, some guy remaked CS_ESTATE, but he give to his map name of CS_MANSION. So anyway, original mansion was my first map i start playing CS )\r\nI remember that times, i haven't own PC yet, and play SEGA MEGADRIVE and Sony PS1... My friend tells me \"in our cybercafes was out new pwning game - COUNTER-STRIKE! And we go to the club and when we get inside everyone has played CS) the map was CS_MANSION. I start play and i don't know even how to buy weapons, how to move, i just stay in hostages room and every round got pwned by others. And i say that day \"Omg this map and this game is most amazing game I've ever played!\"\r\n\r\nSo, when CSS is out, i start searching sites and servers for this old cs_mansion, but have no luck. I don't know why but no one makes this map for CSS yet. So I do this. \r\n\r\nHowewer, this is the BETA. I didnt'm make cameras for ct spawn, and there is only pregenerated .nav meshes, so bot's don't use watercanal and ladder yet. But i'll fix it, when i'll have time. So, enjoy the map! I think you'll like it! It's a kind of nostalgie for me)\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Supporting High Dynamic Range - HDR\r\n- 64 spawnpoints\r\n- 3 hostages, working lightswitches\r\n- A LOT OF FUN AND COOL GAMEPLAY\r\n\r\n[Hybrid] aka Lunatic:\r\nLevel Geomety / Texturing / Design / Waypoints\r\n\r\nSheeprider (The great man and a good mapper who helps me with my map):\r\nBuiling Cubemaps / HDR Lighting / Map Compiling / Bug Fixes\r\n\r\nOther credits are belong to Valve and original authors of cs_mansion\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANK TO: all FPSB community for providing tutorials and giving advices!
