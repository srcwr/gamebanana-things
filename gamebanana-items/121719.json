	"_sText": "The sequel to surf_beyer with 5 bonuses by Skye, FalseLogic, Doink Face, Krazy, and myself. I made this to take a break from my larger surf project, and got carried away and ended up finishing a 1:40 tier 4 linear SurfTimer map that gets progressively harder and more intense as it goes on. Look for the cool eastereggs and have a look at all of the game_text I included!\r\n\r\nBeta Testers:\r\n=============\r\n- Raiin\r\n- Habitat-\r\n- Chaaaaaaaad\r\n- Evil MrMuffinz\r\n- Jake\r\n- Pand3mic\r\n- Krazy\r\n- Skye\r\n- Syncronyze\r\n- Pharaoh\r\n- Kalle\r\n- Mark C\r\n- Doink Face\r\n- FalseLogic\r\n- Daniel\r\n- Scrap\r\n- CaS\r\n- Malt\r\n- stevo\r\n- spar\r\n- drakuly\r\n- Totaldankness\r\n- ALLCAPS\r\n- Frag\r\n\r\n**Special thanks to Raiin for all of the constructive criticism and helping me make the map more enjoyable.**\r\n\r\nThanks to Komaokc for the skybox, and ToppHATTWaffle, and Silkroad for textures.\r\n\r\nNote to server owners:\r\nI've got a google doc with all of the trigger dimensions and origins for adding it to your surf timer. Contact me on steam and I'll send it to you.\r\nRemember to remove the point_servercommand and logic_auto. It has sv_cheats 1 in it which i forgot to remove.\r\n\r\n[Map converted to CS:GO by pand3mic](http://csgo.gamebanana.com/maps/183312)"
