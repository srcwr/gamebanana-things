	"_sText": "It's amazing how a map can evolve. \r\nThis, for example, began as a coop project by myself and Urby under the working title \"ss_pijamas.\" \r\nThe \"ss\" stood for Silent Strike which was an experimental gamemode we discovered quite by chance in which players only have 15hp, and CTs are limited to silent weapons and are outnumbered by terrorists to a ratio of around 3:1. It proved to be exceptionally fun, but these sort of things tend to be a love or hate deal - so it was changed back to regular ol' CS. \r\n\r\nThis map has been featured in several Scotch and Coffee videos, and contains the SnC offices. \r\n\r\nThere are tens of easter eggs and secret areas, a proper radar with nav locations and more custom materials than you can shake a stick at. \r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Urby's office was made by him. That is all. So much for \"coop\" the lazy bastard ;D"
