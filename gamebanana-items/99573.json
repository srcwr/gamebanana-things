NOTE\r\n\r\nThis is the updated, hopefully final version of [cs_aurora](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/172440 \"cs_aurora\"), revised largely due to the fine feedback of USF|Jack. For details on the map, check the above [link](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/172440 \"link\"). Here are the changes I made:\r\n\r\n- added a new route to the hostages.\r\n- added some kind of radar/overview. \r\n- fixed a few bad player clips.\r\n- added a couple of models.\r\n- fiddled a bit with cubemaps and sprites.\r\n\r\n(The screenshots are supposed to show most of the changes.)\r\n\r\nWhile I'm at it, thanks to everyone who commented, rated, downloaded and played the original cs_aurora. Next map is under construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaBello"
