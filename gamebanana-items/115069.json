	"_sText": "<hr /><center>This map was intended to be a beta and testing version, but as it took ages to compile its unlikely that i'll recompile it anytime soon. This means there are some bugs in the map that would have been removed for the final version.</center><hr /><b>Details:</b><br />\r\nThis is my remake of the popular Halo 2 map, Ascension. There are a few problems with this version, due to the above reason (they include a few black textures and a dark T spawn), but the layout, gameplay, and looks aren't impaired at all. There are a few eastereggs to hunt for, and the grav lift/booster works like the original.\r\n\r\n<b>Specs:</b><br />\r\n24 spawns, buyzones, spawned weapons, eastereggs, custom textures, animated brushwork, action-triggered sound files.\r\n\r\n<br />Please visit <a href=\"http://www.gamebanana.com/studios/2377\">Clan 5k3's studio</a> for more Halo css maps and materials."
