	"_sText": "Hi! This is my first surf map. And surprisingly made this map in just a day. Quite absurd but true.<br><br><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>Map Contains~</b></span><br>8 Surfs.<br>3 Defend Points. ( out of 1 will get repeated. i.e 4).<br>3/8 Surfs are Tier 1.<br>I wanted to add Tier8 Surf but that would prove to be a disaster. So, didn't added that.<br>1 Human Item. i.e LaserGun from ze_eerie_escape.<br>Good Music :)<br>Lasers with a Boss at the end. <br><br>Map is comparatively harder than other Zombie Escape Surf maps, because of fast triggers, some defend points are harder without more humans. Overall, map is  short and really fun. I like de_dust2, so I made this map with de_dust2 layout and surprisingly it turned out to be great.<br>Took inspiration from some past surf maps such as <b class=\"SelectedElement\">surf_mom </b>and as well as the legendary surf_vortex and surf_facility.
