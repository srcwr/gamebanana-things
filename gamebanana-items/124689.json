	"_sText": "Sup im flume and here is bhop_clarity, mainly inspired by other simplistic maps out there and yea i know its overused. This map is for the more **_intermediate_** bhoppers who can beat most maps out there. Alot of grindy bhop parts with some climb to mix up the gameplay. Not much of a theme here just kinda thought of stuff and made it. This map can be played on auto easy legit or what ever type of hop you want to play it on. If you enjoy the map or dislike it please comment and tell me how i can improve my mapping and/or the map itself. If there is **_anything_** wrong with the map please message me and I will work to get it fixed fast. \r\nBonus song: Konata's Corridor of Time\r\n__This map is in beta__\r\nHappy hopping!"
