You've got intel that the old castle outside the city is \r\nthe origin of this virus and you have to stop this mad AI from \r\ncontinuing its destruction of the world.<br><br>-- Info<br>It's a one stage map that contains:<br>- 1 Boss<br>- 1 Item<br>- Castle Crashers soundtrack<br>The map doesn't require the stripper to work, but without it, some triggers will say the wrong times and the boss won't be that big of a challenge which makes it quite boring.<br>"
