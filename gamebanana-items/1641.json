They've got fish and whatnot in the water. But really, just a basic tunnel prefab, aside from a standard one ;)\r\n\r\nUse as needed!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMrWhite@theunworthycraftsmen.clanservers.com\r\n\r\nP.S - Special thanks to uberkirsche for getting me motivated to start making more prefabs :) Without him, id be a lazy SOB....
