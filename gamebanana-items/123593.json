	"_sText": "I'm quite proud of this map.  It's a small arena based on a symbol of the Buddhist religion.  Although most people will probably recognize it as the symbol of the Dharma Initiative from 'Lost.'  Initially it was too small, so I added two levels.  I'm especially proud of the bombsite.  I spent such a long time on it and I think it's quite good for my first attempt.  I am also quite fond of the textures and general atmosphere.  This was also the first time I used precipitation and face edit in a map.\r\n\r\nThe bombsite is kind of hidden.  You have to shoot out the dots in the Yin Yang to drop down to a small space to plant.  You can't get out, though--not that it'd matter, seeing as the map is so small that you're dead regardless of where you are when the bomb explodes.\r\n\r\n"
