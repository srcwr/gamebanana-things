There is a buyzone for both teams in the middle if you can find it.  I always got turned around and I made the map!  LOL.  If you're running it on a server let me know and I can take the shotguns out for a gg server.  I can do this with any of my maps so let me know.  All feedback welcome!  ritdawg99@yahoo.com"
