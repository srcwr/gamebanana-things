	"_sText": "so this takes place before Gordon Freeman arrived at the train station. pretty near the Citadel. but it hasn't been discovered yet by the Combine its just bombarded with missiles and bombs and it used to be a campus but when the Combine came, it becomes a resistance's major bases but suddenly they vanished out of thin air. they lastly placed combine deadly weapons in a metal crate. and another man made weapons and artillery crates being transported by train. and since the place is gone of resistance the remaining human soldiers are planning to destroy the citadel by using these weapons in secrecy but the terrorists are planning to blow up the campus because they are the bullies of the campus (the bad eggs of students way back then) now they want revenge. so who will prevail? its your choice."
