I think its balanced mostly. \r\nNotes about this map:\r\n-bridge can be broken\r\n-acid pits do kill you\r\n-spawn killing won't happen\r\n-camping at spawn won't work either\r\n-portals take you both ways.\r\n-can't shoot people though portals :P\r\n\r\n Pm if there are bugs with the portals. The cake is a lie :D\r\nhave fun"
