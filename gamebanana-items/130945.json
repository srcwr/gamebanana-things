It's more like Stage 1, because I plan to make more.<br>This stage serves as feedback. I hope to see how it comes out on a real gameplay. This feedback helps me to advance my creations.<br>Stage 1 contains the basic of ZE and mapping. <br>There is no boss, there are no custom particles nor textures.<br>But there is one human item (Crowbar).<br>I hope that my config works for the entwatch plugin.<br><br><h2>Story</h2>(Some of us are still waiting for Half Life 3)<br>Three months after the destruction of the citadel, the citizens of City 17 are in a peril situation. The combine may be weakend and they went to their last bases, but the real danger is the environment. <br>Due ciritcal damage, caused by the explosion of the citadel, most flats and accommodations are uninhabitable.<br>Humanity has to live with the lack of resources.<br>In a peril attempt, a new organized special force has been sent to Ravenholm to evaluate the situation. <br>Ravenholm itself fell under the attack of the combines back in the old regime, but most buildings are intact.<br>The main proplem are the headcrabs and their fellow zombies.<br>The Combine have used almost 80% of their caught headcrabs for Ravenholm.<br>It's the Nexus of the Zombie-Plague and its residents have evolved.....<br><br><h3>To do list:</h3><del>+ Add more details and decals<br></del>+ Improve the lightning<br><del>+ [Maybe] Change the gameplay after real gameplay, if needed</del><br>+ Fix bad lightnings on some doors<br><del>+ Optimize the map</del><br><del>+ Add Hint and Skips</del><br><del>+ Add grass-sprites<br></del><br>**** Hotfix ****<br>removed the nav. which caused crashing the server.<br><br><h3>Credits and special thanks:</h3>Valve for the Hammer Editor, Maps, Textures, Models and Sounds.
