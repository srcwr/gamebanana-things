Shoot the ball into the enemy's goal to win.\r\n\r\nGlocks are used in place of knives, and heal triggers tick 20 times per second to avoid kills.\r\n\r\nLayout 1: Generic arena obstacles\r\nLayout 2: Walled layout\r\nLayout 3: Central fan with two walls\r\nLayout 4: Spinning axes with 4 bumpers (SS)\r\n\r\nLook for more designs in a future updated release.\r\n\r\nThis map is the jail of an under development privately released surf map, modified for sports.\r\n\r\nNo fancy cubemaps due to Source massively failing during build and defaulting to skybox cubes."
