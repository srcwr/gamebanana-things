The scientists have been put into a \"safe house\", some apartments in the city, where they can hide until the threat is dispersed. Unfortunately, the terrorists found their hideout. In the attempt to capture the scientists, their getaway became compromised by counter-terrorists. Now, they have to take the scientists as hostages. The terrorists started to build barricades, but they weren't fast enough...</p>\r\n<p><b class=\"blue\">Counter-Terrorists :</b></p>\r\n<p>Lead the hostages to one of the rescue zones or eliminate all terrorists, before the mission time goes out. The hostages are expected to be in the apartments west of the insert point. The rescue zones are located by the river and in the street north of the apartments.</p>\r\n<p><b class=\"red\">Terrorists :</b></p>\r\n<p>Prevent the counter-terrorists from rescuing the hostages or eliminate all counter-terrorists.</p>"
