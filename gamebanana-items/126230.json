A speed up, non designed linear bunnyhop map. Can't imagine what this is? Just watch it naow, here:\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/5FEJwuvoq4g?fs=1&amp;hl=de_DE\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/5FEJwuvoq4g?fs=1&amp;hl=de_DE\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nNow we cleared that. (You may sub my channel. :P)\r\n\r\nThe Map shouldn't be realased at all, it has a cold feeling, doesn't look nice, has no real spawn and end.\r\nSo, why i am releasing this?\r\nI've never seen a linear bunnyhop map, this is something pretty original and fun to play on. May inspirate someone to create something that's not that boring.\r\n\r\nIf your Rating this map, don't act anything to the design!\r\nThe FPS Should be held pretty high and this was just made for fun.\r\n\r\nSo Far that's all -\r\nenjoy. (:\r\n\r\n**NOTICE: Your starting with standard weapons in a lil spawn. Noblock's required. Also this map ain't that easy, it's to long. So don't call this undoable! I don't know if it works on tick 200, since you need the right amount of speed to hit the Bhop thingies correctly.**"
