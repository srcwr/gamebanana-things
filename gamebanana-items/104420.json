To me this map seems to be pretty good, the bots will choose one of about 3 ways to go which is good (with some maps they go the same way every time). I may put in some hostages but for now i think its fine for it to be just kill everyone :) . i also have to optimize it more so if you computer isnt the best and you get low framerates, that should be fixed eventually."
