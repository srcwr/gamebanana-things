	"_sText": "This is in my opinion, my best map yet. You start off very high up. Shoot the ground, it breaks. You fall and have three options. land on a platform, grab an awp and snipe. Or land on the middle platform and grab a gun there. Or go through the tunnels and through the teleporting labarynth. In the labaryth there is a chamber of many guns. Don't worry, when you hit the ground you simply get teleported back up...most of the time. And the platforms have a thin layer of water so you don't die. Have fun. The upper falling part was originally made by Nipper.\r\n\r\nUpdate!!\r\n\r\n- Added ammo for weapons\r\n- Redid textures (more varied)\r\n- Fixed a problem with one of the tunnels that if you fell, you would hit a ledge and take damage.\r\n\r\nThinking about taking away buyzones.... should I?\r\n\r\nUpdate!! (lol quick)\r\n\r\n- Fixed a ledge on the other side too."
