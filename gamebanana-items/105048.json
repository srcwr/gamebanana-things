	"_sText": "I developed this as a training map for my old clan Karma's Crusaders. It was supposed to train certain skills. For example, the column area is for learning to side step and fire, the garden area is to learn to always aim at head height, the dust area is to promote use of sound (hear people walking) and the glass area was supposed to develop jumping skills and agility. I don't know if it ever achieved those things but it did end up becoming quite a lot of fun to play. This map was my second attempt at a map, my first being a really shitty little aim map that no longer exists."
