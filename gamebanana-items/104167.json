And yes, you can ride the trains. \r\n\r\nI've always wanted a map like this, but never found one. So I built one myself. Everything works extremely well, never thought it would turn out this good. It's not that big, and the bombtarget is in the middle, which should keep round times down. The trains move back and forth along the whole map. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo download NOW! This is an awesome map every server should host! "
