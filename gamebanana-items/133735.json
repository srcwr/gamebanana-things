For the final release I will scale down the custom decals, in this version I still was carefull cause I did not want to make them too small.\r\n\r\nPlease give me honest and constructive feedback _after_ you looked at the map ingame. Please do not judge just by viewing the screenshots. If you want to use the custom decals or models please ask before ripping them out of the bsp-file.\r\n\r\nKind regards<br>\r\n\r\nSchnittbrot"
