Barrels and crates that have been dumped into the underpass from above make for good cover. With two platforms at each spawn that offer a vantage point over the underpass.\r\n\r\nNote: This is Micro Version, the will be an extended version coming soon. Hope you enjoy our work!\r\n\r\n**My First Release on FPSB. <3"
