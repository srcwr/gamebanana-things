I turned the map into a concrete/modern themed jail map.\r\n\r\nIt was designed for the Ct's to be able to have full control over the t's, they can watch the t's from behind the cells to stop them from hiding :]\r\nThe map is currently being played on the Edgegamers Jailbreak server and does not lag with 40 players on.\r\nThere are 20 Ct Spawns and 40 T Spawns, this version was created for Edgegamers, but different versions can be arranged if you notify me.\r\n\r\n**This map requires NOBLOCK as many of the games are in small areas and you could end up with t's stuck together**\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n* Climb\r\n* Rubix Disco\r\n* Maze\r\n* Games Area\r\n* S4S\r\n* Pool\r\n* Heal\r\n* Couch Room\r\n* Sandcastle :)\r\n* Gym and Gym Climb\r\n* Sewers\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Features\r\n* There are secret spritetrails hidden around the map that use custom textures, (green and rainbows)\r\n* A well designed Lockdown that locks each part of the prison down over a period of 3 minutes.\r\n* A large sandcastle for the t's to play in\r\n* A large sewer area for t's to rebel\r\n\r\nMinor Bugs\r\n* Some Walls stick out\r\n\r\nThe map is completely optimized and should not lag (tested with 40/40)\r\n\r\nTesters -\r\n\r\nPhasexero\r\nRoguesniper\r\nAngeal\r\nLava\r\nEnfiorce\r\nPhaseXero\r\n"
