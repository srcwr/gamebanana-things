	"_sText": "Originally created for the Joe.To 2008 Halloween map pack, I wanted to re-create a map loosely based on the very popular Silent Hill games (namely the first one). Travel through the thick fog and rescue those hostages! They're scared, and they need your help!\r\n\r\nI also do not suggest playing this map with bots. They can see through the fog and kill you from very far away.\r\n\r\nMore info found in the map's readme, only seen in-game before joining a game."
