Map information\r\n\r\nAt first I was a bit reluctant to release this as it was made for my friends of Clan stoned, but thought id show\r\neveryone anyway, I am not normally a fan of dust maps but thought this was a bit of an exception seeming as its\r\nmade for the stoned clan. The map took me 3 days to finish\r\n\r\nThe map includes a Radar and Nav.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to the author of fy_dust who ever it is, a small portion of the map was based around that as the stoned clan\r\nasked me to rework that map and this is what i came up with.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\n"
