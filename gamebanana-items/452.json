	"_sText": "This map was originally being made for a freind.\r\nHs said one day whether it would be cool to have an escape map where you escape by being shot out of a gun.\r\nSo i said it would be interesting and so I did this.\r\nSo this is intended to be a Zombie Escape map. Where you spawn, you would then of have to run to the revolver and then climb up the handle, set off the trigger get in the chamber and hold off the zombies there.\r\n\r\nI have put in the animations needed. (Shoot the hazard strip box in trigger guard)\r\nDo it as a CT to see the whole thing in motion.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i can not no longer complete it myself. I have too much work with college.\r\nSO instead of being greedy :P, i have released it hear.\r\n\r\nHope you guys and girls enjoy it. \r\n\r\n"
