	"_sText": "On the outskirts of New York, drug labs have been set up in an effort to make some side cash for Phoenix in the hopes that buying items of mass destruction will be a little easier. A drug bust was set up by the FBI in hopes of apprehending the suspected Phoenix members. Not only did they get proof of Illicit substances but they've kidnapped 2 of the agents for ransom. Needless to say we think they've decided to \"turn themselves in\".&nbsp; Counter Terrorists will be sent via helicopter and are tasked with storming the building and bringing the agents across the street where the FBI have an undercover truck prepared to secure them. How the mission turns out is up to you.<br><br>Drubust is a short, fast paced Hostage Rescue map and is my first CS map. I have fumbled with Hammer before so needless to say I'm a little impressed with my results. The map is mostly artpassed so unless your looking for issues, you most likely won't find any. I once had planned for T side to have a dig site leading into the subway which is what the subway entrances were for. I canned that because i thought the map didn't need it. I might bring it back in a future version when i decide to work on that.<br><br>Needless to say I'm glad i could get 1 less little art piece off of my folder of source crap. Hope you enjoy."
