	"_sText": "Hello guys.\r\n\r\nHopefully i could finish this map. The map has 3 standard levels (multibhop platforms) and 1 as bonus (no prespeed allowed).\r\n\r\nIt took me about 8 months to finish, because i didn't know how to make maps, and i didn't map during a long time. By the way the result is good and the gameplay is pretty fun. \r\n\r\nThis is just a mid skilled bhop map. But maybe the bonus is pretty harder. Hope you enjoy, and tell me your opinion!!"
