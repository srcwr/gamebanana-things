It was a real pain getting here and I'm still having VVIS woes, but they will be fixed for this maps final release.  Bots do not work amazingly, but do the job and FPS are aroudn that of cs_militia.\r\n\r\nHDR works beutifully and on a decent comp this map is one of the best I have ever done.\r\n\r\nI cannot stress enough that this is a beta and I need feedback to improve the map and make a final release, send me any problems you find, no matter how small.\r\n\r\nFinally, have fun playin' it, Rokusho"
