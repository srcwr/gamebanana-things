Compared to many other surf maps, it is quite small, but I managed to fit a few areas as well as a jail in this map. I would like to thank the FPSBanana community for writing the tutorials that helped me with the creation of this map, a small sampling of which were tutorials about creating weapon dispensers, stripping weapons, and making ramps the right size and angle. Thank you all for helping me with this map."
