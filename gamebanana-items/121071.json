	"_sText": "This map was designed by me and a friend and I am now publishing it here to FPSB. This is a VERY small map i know this is a little map that we are testing with to see how people like the \"style\" of map if they like how it works then they will get MUCH BIGGER and more complicated. There are 12CT spawns and 12T spawns 4 awps at mid with 150 rounds in them. There a \"conveyers\" at the very top of the map kinda like surf_greatriver_v4 did. We hope you enjoy and please leave feed back. REMEBER: this is a TEST of how you like the IDEA of the map we will expand depending on feed back.\r\nThanks \r\n-JARHEAD-Xombine Studios-mapper"
