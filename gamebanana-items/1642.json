Theres a few boxes spread around, but only the 1 is important, the top of the box is breakable after 100 damage has been done to it, revealing a tunnel going down, and a ladder. For the meantime, i just put a dev room at the bottem, but you can certainly use your imagination to figure out what to add/remove.\r\n\r\n Enjoy :D"
