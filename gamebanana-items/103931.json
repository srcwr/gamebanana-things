	"_sText": "So this is my map the de_sgc_b05 it's a kind of test version for my upcoming fy_sgc. Basically the same map but no spawned guns on the ground and there is a bomb site. It's fun map to play. At least that is my and my alphatester's opinnion. It's a beta so it will look even prettyer when it's done.\r\n\r\nThere is also few screenshots from my other project as a bonus!\r\n\r\nI counted the spawns and the maximum number of players players is 20 but i recommend 14 players. I havn't played it with 20 but i think it's better the less players there is. That's just my personal opinion and i hope you prove me wrong."
