	"_sText": "Morning Call\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n**Today is February 10th. When I woke up in the morning, I felt the bright sun shines into my room. I turned on my computer and used it for a while. It was a nice morning, until my friend called me. \"Hello? Are you still sleeping?\" he said. Damn! I forgot the trip with my friends. I put on a coat, grabbed my bag and wallet then rushed out immediately. After I got to the train station, I noticed I forgot my phone. Oh no...**\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nYou can climb nails, cables, ropes, some cloth or something looks like \"climbable\", also you can check if there is an \"up\" or \"down\" sign near it.\r\n\r\nThe bomb site is the area in front of the monitor on the desk.\r\n\r\nThe Electric Mosquito Zapper can be turn on by shooting the switch, watch out.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n### Specials\r\n\r\nDon't try to jump on the bed from high places, it hurts.\r\n\r\nThe screen on the monitor changes every rounds.\r\n\r\nSometimes the phone will ring.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks to my friends for testing\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my friend LAJ for calling me(for making the texture)\r\n\r\nAll custom textures, materials and this map were made by CXX AL\r\n\r\n[Link to a short video of beta version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaY-E_DV-Mw \"A link to a short testing video of beta version map\")(almost same as final version)"
