	"_sText": "This was my third effort at a map. I really enjoyed the theme of maps like de_cbble and de_piranesi and the flowing gameplay of de_dust2, so I tried to come up with something that borrowed from those maps but had its own unique feel. I spent a ridiculous amount of time just trying to get textures right, and tbh I've still got some work to do. The idea of the map is that the player feels like they are in an enormous medieval mountain castle. I tried to cut down on the AWP factor by putting in a level-wide fog, which also adds nicely to the mountain castle feel. The whole thing still has some way to go but atm I'm a little bit over it. I'd appreciate comments and suggestions, they might inspire me to start working on it again.\r\n\r\nPS I used a gargoyle in 'A' bombsite that some bloke created and posted on FPSBanana. I modified it to suit my theme and I can't remember who the original creator was. If it was yours, cheers, credit to you."
