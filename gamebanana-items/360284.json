	"_sText": "originally I was gonna quit mapping for awhile after releasing viridis. however, that only lasted a couple days lol. not too sure what made me want to make this but nonetheless, here it is.<br><br>map is loosely set in \"rome\". I did look at real pictures and locations when making some of these but they're more or less inspired by them instead of copying. also yes I know the houses kind of look like hotels/motels. don't hate me.<br><br>map features 4 stages<br><br>stage 1 - poor mans st peters square<br>stage 2 - road/neighborhood with a roman villa in the center<br>stage 3 - outside of a pantheon in rome<br>stage 4 - inside the pantheon. honestly the theme for this stage isn't as unique as the others ones, but it still looks good. I also added a little \"visitors\" center at the end of it lol. The end of stage 4 is a small little neighborhood with houses as well.<br>bonus - looks the same as stage 4<br><br>Not entirely sure what an optimized run of this could be. Samurai got around 1:20 unoptimized with stages 1-3, so i'm going to assume it'll be around 1:50. bonus is around 15-20 seconds.<br><br>lastly, in my opinion, the map looks better when its slightly darker. I would put it around 40-50% brightness<br><br>"
