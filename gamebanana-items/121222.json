	"_sText": "I remade the scoutzknivez map because i wanted some hidden rooms and a 1v1 room. There is a hidden guns room. Their are 8 hidden buttons in the level 2 open and close the door for where the weapons room. The rest opens a door to different types of weapons. But once you open the weapon doors it will appear as if they where never opened just walk along the wall until you find it. I added my vmf file in their so just ignore it if your not a map maker (you can delete it). Also check out the knk clan server out... 24/7 Surf Random Maps : 8.12.68.13:27015.
