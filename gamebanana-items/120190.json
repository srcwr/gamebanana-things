This one looks prettier and has randomly spawning rocks.\r\n\r\nIf any one can survive to get onto the ledges below they might be able to kill the other team by entering the small room off the side of the area. The aim of the game isn't really to kill the other team, hence why there are no weapons. You're meant to SURVIVE. But you won't."
