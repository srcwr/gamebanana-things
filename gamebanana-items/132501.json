	"_sText": "Big thank you goes out to KizzBizz for making this map and for giving us hours of fun in Zombie Mod playing it! Without him this wouldn't have been possible!\r\n=============================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\n### UPDATE ON 1/13/12:  : Fixed the custom decals not showing up in-game and the extreme glossyness, everything should be 100% now! Sorry for the 19 of you who downloaded versions 2-3, once you download v4 you should be good to go. Sorry!\r\n\r\n- CHANGES:\r\n- Took out Skybox (credits to KizzBizz still in-game). \r\n- New pool of water in Terrorist spawn.\r\n- Cage platform above Terrorist spawn is now broken open allowing players to jump down and across to the other platform. \r\n- Can't glitch through wood barricades anymore. \r\n- Two more wood barricades added (sealing off the broken platform and upper cavern).\r\n- Darker environment for a more tense/creepy gameplay experience. \r\n- Changed/moved security room buttons (with new door mechanics).\r\n- Several props added and replaced compared to the older version.  \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading and supporting the Paranormal Containment Project.\r\n============================================================================\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJoin our Steam group and play with us in our 50 slot ZombieHunt server:\r\n[http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ParanormalContainmentProject](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ParanormalContainmentProject \"Official ||pCp|| Steam Group\")"
