	"_sText": "I just built a small room with 4 explosive barrels, which can only be blown up with the detonator button. These barrels will blow a hole in the wall to the second room.\r\nI added some sparks to the wire for a better look.\r\n\r\nThe clue is that the wall and the barrels are respawning after about 15 seconds. After that time it can be activated again.\r\n\r\nI just made this for a friend because he wanted to know how to handle respawning func_breakables and stuff... and i decided to share it with everyone :)\r\n\r\nYou can take a look here how respawning things work.\r\n\r\nI hope this will help some mappers :)\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe :)\r\n\r\nDotty"
