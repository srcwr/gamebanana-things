	"_sText": "My first fully completed map, used by my clan for warmups and muck arounds.\r\n\r\nThe map is split into two halves by a huge wall, with various ways through, around and over it.\r\n\r\nI've tried to make this map as varied as possible, allowing a wide range of weapons and tactics.  There are a few sniper spots dotted around the map, along with narrow corridors for SMGs.  Both spawns are fairly well protected, but neither offers any attacking options for potential campers, so it should keep the map lively and flowing.\r\n\r\nI've included a few \"secret areas\" that involve timed jumping rather than fake walls, and these secrets are balanced out by the fact you are exposed whilst trying to get to them.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy, and I should have more to come soon :)\r\n\r\n(ps: this is my first AND ONLY texture map)"
