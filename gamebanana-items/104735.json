	"_sText": "Originally de_point was designed by unknown mapper and it had a lot of bugs. I've decided to repair it and re-design some parts of the map ;)\r\n\r\n<b>Change log:</b>\r\n1. Terrorists don't spawn in front of the door anymore.\r\n2. Added a breakable glass at terrorist spawn - it protects from kills at round start. It has only 1 hp, so you can destroy it very fast ;)\r\n3. Added a ladder which makes possible to cross the fence at longway.\r\n4. Crates on the long street don't block players anymore.\r\n5. Deleted bugged room.\r\n6. Fixed doors in building.\r\n7. Added some decals.\r\n8. A few textures changed.\r\n9. Rotating block has been textured.\r\n10. Created INACCURATE radar.\r\n\r\n<b>INSTALATION:</b>\r\nPlayers: just unpack the file into your \\Steam\\SteamApps\\login\\counter-strike source\\cstrike directory\r\n\r\n<b>Servers: If your server has tick 100, you have to run map with phys_timescale 1.5 parameter</b>"
