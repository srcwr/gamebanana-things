	"_sText": "This is one of the most fun maps I've created!  I've never messed around with fog before and originally wanted to mess with spotlight FX.  It took me awhile to create because I wasn't too familiar with how to create certain things but I think I did an alright job for a noob.  Players can't see all the way to the end of the map and it's meant to have a \"hazy\" effect.  Runs pretty nice and looks nice too and I can't wait to play it.  This map includes all weapons.  If anyone runs it on a server please let me know which one and how you like it."
