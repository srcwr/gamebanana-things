I designed fy_snow_2, fy_snow_3, and fy_snow_4 and made them with him back in the CS 1.3 days. He posted his fy_snow_x to FPSBanana two years ago. I made it into a GunGame map and added some new features such as the ladders to the upper area, extra walls for more cover in the open side areas, and elevated platforms to the sides as well as some crates, breakable boards up top, and snowmen. I also threw in some extra HE grenades and even some flashbangs.\r\n\r\nOverall this map is very fun and very well made. I think everyone will enjoy it quite a bit. It deserves to be added to your server rotations on gungame servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOME PLAY IT ON MY SERVER:\r\n\r\nWarmFuzzyLand -- 100 Tick | GunGame Turbo | FunSkins | FastDL\r\n72.26.102.140:27015\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremy \"Air\" Hurley\r\nEmail: basicair1@cox.net\r\nAIM: basicair1\r\nIRC: irc.gamesurge.net (Air)"
