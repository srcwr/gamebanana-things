I chose a gungame style map, because it's my favorite game-style and the simplicity made it easy to adapt.\r\n\r\nThe map is based on a gg_deagle5 style obstacle labyrinth, but with added functionality on the sides.\r\n\r\nAll credit to the creator of the deagle5 style for my inspiration.\r\n\r\nPlease rate and comment with tips and PLEASE tell me if I screwed anything up..remember, this is my FIRST attempt at map making, and I only want to get better.\r\n\r\n**INSTALLATION**\r\nExtract files to steamapps\\YOURNAME\\counter-strike source\\cstrike\\maps\r\nor extract to any location and copy then paste into your maps folder.\r\n\r\nThat simple!"
