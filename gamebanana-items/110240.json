But(!), it's not as easy\r\nas you think! If someone steps in the caution strips, he will die immediately! So: fight for your life, and thanks\r\nfor playing.\r\n\r\nIvar\r\n\r\nContact for how to make a map, or questions?\r\nivar_own_you@live.nl\r\n\r\n\r\n(this's my secnd knife map. check my other maps!)"
