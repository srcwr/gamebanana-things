	"_sText": "<font color=\"#6666FF\">This map shares many style similarities with my first zombie map, <a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/25059\">zm_cabin</a>,  but has many differences.  Rooms are larger and not as compact//confusing as those in cabin.  Also, I learned how to make area portals with doors.  Coupled with using fun_details from the very start, the area portal doors have let this map have wildly improved frame rates.  On my junk computer, the average rate is around 40FPS, but I've seen up to 70 in some areas.  On my dedicated server  test players with better comps have reported even better rates.\r\n\r\nThe map has three custom textures packed into it, they're humorous motivational posters and can be found in the security rooms next to T-Spawn.\r\n\r\nThe map itself isn't particularly complicated like it's name suggests, but it's got some very abstract features, such as a barn house outdoors underneath some rooms which can't be seen because the sky is in the way.  WTF?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope y'all enjoy this map.\r\n\r\n--UPDATED MAY 21 2007--\r\n\r\n- New room was added\r\n- Added Cubemaps\r\n- Deleted some entities that I believe caused some problems\r\n\r\nNew filename is zm_complication_v2.bsp</font>"
