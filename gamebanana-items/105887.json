It has 64 spawns but I would only recommend playing 16 on 16 max.\r\n\r\nPlease don't criticize the water until you have actually played the map and looked at it. \r\n\r\nAll constructive criticism is appreciated, and I hope you like the map. The Map looks a lot nicer in-game also.\r\n\r\nHave fun, enjoy, and always look both ways before crossing the street,\r\nDoF \r\n\r\nPlease tell me if you add this to your server, because I will stop by and play a few games!!!! Thanks! "
