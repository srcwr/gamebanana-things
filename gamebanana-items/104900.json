	"_sText": "Here it is Hoejkontor, i used alot of my time on it and its my first real map. Its Bomb/Defuse map and its very fun to play. I know there no lightning or envioment lightning simply cause it fucked it all up lol.\r\n\r\nIn the map is some elements from the Hoejhus9, exsample the T-Roof but i did so you cant really camp up there. You'll see. The reason why there is so many elements from the Hoejhus9 is that alot of them are great! I shield of the \"bridge\" because i hate when people B-hop down to CT-spawn too fast lol.\r\n\r\nThe Big Pole at the top can be \"used\" by clicking the buttom side turning against T-spawn and a bomb will be spawnd. (And some explosion and stuff will happen)\r\n\r\nTheres a elevator.\r\n\r\nA monitor at CT-spawn connected to a camera on top.\r\n\r\nA hole that can break on top of Bombsite (almost invinsible)\r\n\r\nI've used alot of diffrent things explosion, sounds, shake etc. I've messed around with alot of things.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-shadow:0px 0px 15px red;color:Black;font-size:20pt;\">RATE THE MAP! ;)</p style=\"text-shadow:0px 0px 15px red;color:Black;font-size:20pt;\">"
