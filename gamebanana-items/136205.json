This is a completely 'dev' textured map, a few exceptions such as light textures, 'nodraw', and a few others. This took about 2-3 weeks to accomplish (stupid work, and school), enjoy!\r\n\r\n<fieldset>This is going to be my latest map designed for Counter-Strike: Source GunGame mod. Its currently undergoing the making of its life time. I've put about 10-15 hours into this so far, and its not even 1/4 of the way there. I'm going to make a door that goes to the mapper credits currently \"Pyro-Teknix\" and underdevelopment is \"Green Mike\". In the credits room there will be door buttons and light switches outside, and in, on both sides. There will be music which will be but in which I will establish soon. This map is me trying to be as various and broad as possible with the realistic/cartoon/fun/random map, just a general GunGame/DeathMatch map. Enjoy in a few, the estimated release date will be around Januray 8th-15th, 2008.</fieldset>"
