All credit goes to him for the design of the map.\r\n\r\nHe and I made this map while at camp.  It was played there and others at the camp enjoyed it, so he released it on FPSB.  We hope you enjoy it too.\r\n\r\nThis map is very large and has dark corners from which to snipe.  Because of the map's size, sniping is generally preferred over rushing."
