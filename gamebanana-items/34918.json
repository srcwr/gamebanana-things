It's a completely created from scratch and fully hand-tuned .nav-file (because original mapauthor's nav-file was not fully playable).<br><br>This Navigation Mesh was hand-maded at 50% because in auto-gen nav some areas were made incorrectly and many paths were broken (in particular - some ladders, doorways and windows).<br><br>Well, the bots use all possible ways now. Because they are very much interested in investments to the real estate... as all real robbers :D<br><br>Also this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Named.<br><br>NOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original mapauthor's navigation file available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/33590\">same map</a>.<br><br>Play and Enjoy! Also share your game impressions with mates and friends ;-)<br><br>Credits and Gratitudes: Renouf &amp; Gray (for nice atmospheric, richly detailed and fine designed estate-themed map).<br><br>Additional Gratitudes: BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes), CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps), Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>Don't forget to ring a bell! ;-)"
