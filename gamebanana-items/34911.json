You can find the map here: <a href=\"http://gamebanana.com/maps/5626\">MAP</a><br><br>The autogenerted NAV file that came with the map was horrible and I felt I had to do this awesome remake justice by adding what was missing from it to make for a decent experience with NPC players.<br><br>The navigation mesh is fully place painted as usual according to the names of locations taken right from the classic <b>cs_backalley</b> for CS 1.6/CZ.<br><br>Note: at first bots may seem silent, but that tends to happen on maps with no radar. Don't worry- they're using names of locations just fine. Also sometimes bots might get stuck in vents, because they're dumb :D . I did all I could to minimize that, while keeping those vents usable by them, as it was in the original map."
