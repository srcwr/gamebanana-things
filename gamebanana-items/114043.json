For example place the files in these directories: \"C:\\Program Files/Steam/steamapps/\"your user name\"/counter strike source/cstrike/maps/.../models/...materials/\" The \"...'s\" being each sub folder inside the the main folder tiled \"cstrike.\"\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n3.Description:\r\n\r\n    This is version 2.0 of my CS:S map now called fy_rocketyard(formerly known as fy_iceworld_redux)Its a remix of the classic CS:S and CS:SOURCE map called Iceworld. I started out just wanting to make it a little bit more interesting. I did not plan on adding so much of what I did because I wanted to retain the original look but in a more SOURCE kinda way. At first I started by just making the basic layout but ended up with a hell of a lot more stuff. So, it basically turned into a ICBM rocket testing facility, some where out in an undisclosed(aka fictional)wintry forest location. It has four(4)rockets(the ICBM's)in the middle acting as the original four(4)snowy pillars that where centered in the middle of the original map in Iceworld. The map is square like the previous one expect I added some buildings, watch towers, a loading dock, the missile silos(obviously)and then I added a lower office level(which is now open and houses an ammunition's depot:) The lighting is only a single light_enviroment, but it works just fine, and though it is still not as properly lit as I would of like it to have been it definitely is playable. The map is bot friendly and is fast paced, simple and quick but a ton of fun.\r\n\r\nv.2.0 Fixes:\r\n\r\n + Lighting is now more brighter and covers the entire map.\r\n + The AWP is now back with the rest of the guns on load out. The grenade having replaced the AWP in the middle of the map like in the original iceworld map.\r\n + Shadows have been fixed or turned off(not all but some)\r\n + Added more visuals props to both the playing zone and the surrounding inner sky box area(I say inner because there is no 3D sky box.)\r\n + Added smoke/clouds volumes to the rockets.\r\n + There is an ammunition's depot down in the lower level hall way. So you can go down there and rearm your self with any AK-47, Aug, M1-a1, the MP5, Deagle, the Mac-10, Galil, Famas, xm-1014, m249, or with the Hegranade, Flash bang, and Smoke grenade's aswell. There are C4's and RPG's in the depot as well, but they are only for looks.  \r\n + Placed weapons in original positions just like in iceworld.\r\n + Gave BOTs info_nodes to use(They are awesome!)\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n4.Notes/errors:\r\n\r\n a.Lighting is still kinda off but much better now.\r\n\r\n b.Brushes and textures are still not aligned and/or might be slightly out of place and size.\r\n\r\n c.The gun placement is still a little crowded. I can't really space them out any more but the new placement works just fine as is.\r\n\r\n d.There are 8vs8 CT and T spawning's, so there is 16 spawns in all. Bots now have info_nodes.\r\n \r\n e.There is most likely a lot more problems with the map then I can even think of right now since I updated the visuals and added more geometry to the over all map. I apologize for this, but the map, as of v2.0 is still very playable. So at least try it out and see what you think of it for your self. \r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n5.Author and Acknowledgments:\r\n\r\n + Map by: Chase\"ArrogantOrange\"Miller\r\n\r\n + Rocket Model provided by: PISNORONE his page on FPSBanana.com is: http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/65555\r\n\r\n + Tutorials and training provided by: 3kliksphilip You can find him and his tutorials on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/user/3kliksphilip\r\n\r\n + A big thanx to Valve(obviously)for their great games and the SOURCE SDK(and other versions) \r\n\r\n + and lastly to the viewers like you who make my learning the SDK possible(yea I did just rip off PBS:)\r\n-------------------------\r\n-------------------------\r\n-------------------------\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nAlso: PLEASE SEE THE ACCOMPANYING .TXT FILE LABELED \"Pertaining to the Rocket_silo Model.txt\" FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE ROCKET_SILO MODEL FILE'S, MATERIAL'S FILE'S AND SO ON!!!! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qhQGEjIl7Jk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qhQGEjIl7Jk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>"
