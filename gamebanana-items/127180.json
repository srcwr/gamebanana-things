So please don't judge the map by its difficulty.\r\n\r\nMade by: KeV\r\nThanks to: Fibbs\r\nTested by: Metz, Pinhead, Maffe, York-York, Yorkie & Zippo\r\nCannon prefab by: $ol!d$sn4ke and go0b3rxFTW\r\nFan prefab by: Fibbs\r\n\r\nv1 Notes:\r\n\r\n- Bunnyhop made easier (change delayed by 0.5 seconds)\r\n- Fixed badly textured door (thanks Metz ^^)\r\n- Removed exploitable board of wood\r\n- Easier access to secret area\r\n\r\nv2 notes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed leak (Fibbs ftw!)\r\n- Texture facelift\r\n- Replaced poor trap\r\n- Better looking first trap\r\n- Better lighting in some areas\r\n- Added timer\r\n- Other various tweaks\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will probably be my last map, so I hope you enjoy it,\r\nKeV."
