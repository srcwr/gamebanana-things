	"_sText": "This is a NAV file for <a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/maps/50899\">THIS</a> map and as such will only work on it.<br><br>As a fan of classical maps I always try to make the experience in the remake as close to the original as possible. The map is a great remake of de_fastline from Condition Zero however the bots didn't use the names of the locations, nor did they show up under the radar, so I new I had to edit the NAV file, to bring the gameplay from CZ into CSS.<br>Now the bots will mention where they are in radio messages to the player.<br>Enjoy!"
