	"_sText": "A small map for fast action in GunGame Turbo mode (12v12).\r\nThe walls with spikes will move after a short delay when you spawn, and you have to avoid touching it. You can break the boxes to dig your way up. Or you can go through the middle to the other side, where your enemy spawns.\r\nBasically there are two tactics:\r\n\r\nGet up as quickly as possible. Or get to the other side to avoid being backstabbed by backstabbing the enemy.\r\n\r\nOnce you get up through climbing the boxes, you'll end up in a small and simple shooting arena.\r\n\r\nThe name, obviously, comes from the stress you get of the moving spikes, and climbing up the boxes."
