There it is simple,\r\nKnife you're enemies!\r\n\r\nNow, You're probably thinking \"Wait! This is unfair!\", Well. Its not. The point is\r\nto kill the people that are good at knifing, so you can kill the people that are not\r\nas good at knifing, so you're team will win\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is BETA 5 of mg_dodgeball. There will be many fixes\r\n________________________________________________\r\nCHANGE LOG:\r\n-Added a maze to get to a bunch of guns.\r\n-Instead of having a HUGE basket of smoke grenades, there is a spawner.\r\n-Changed the knife arena a bit, to make it easier to ambush.\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nPlease Report glitches to my FPS Banana account...\r\n\r\nENJOY THE MAP,\r\nOlli3"
