I was never going to release this, but decided today to release it anyways for those who want it.\r\n\r\nI have a dual core w/Geforce 7950, I get 90-250FPS depending where I'm looking.  I would not recommend this map if your still fighting games off with a Geforce MX440.\r\n\r\nStandard servers will need to have the config edited to allow maps this size to download."
