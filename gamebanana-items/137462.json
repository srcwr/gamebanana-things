As well, if you see anything that you think should change, let me know so I can change it, I'm not psychic.\r\n\r\nContains 32 Slots\r\n\r\nNot yet optimized (weird Areaportal errors present, if you can help me with them, PM me)\r\n\r\n<b><font size=3 color=red>Contains over 16 custom textures, 6 custom models, HDR Glow lighting, and music within the map!</font></b>\r\n\r\n<div>To activate the music, go into one of the two DJ booths in the lower section of the spawn areas (they are located in the booth next to the dance poles), and press the console with the glowing green light. At the moment, there is no way to stop the music from playing once it's started, only to restart it.</div>"
