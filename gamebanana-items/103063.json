	"_sText": "This map is a mirrored map with small changes to each side (props, decals, etc..). It is based in a market square and surrounding area. There are 2 main routes to each bomb site, A and B. A is faster to get to, but harder to hold off. B takes longer to get to and is more risky, but when you get there it is easier to hold off.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 market stalls, each of which you can use cover for. There is also a storage unit to the side which could be used for an alternate route. To get to B, you must cross a wide open space which is dangerous because of long-range fire.\r\n\r\nThe map is designed more to be like an FY or an AIM map, but it has bomb sites because it is larger. Instead of the bomb sites being the primary objective, they are more of a secondary objective for stalemates and whatnot.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the map, and thanks for downloading."
