Alternate versions of this may be coming soon.\r\n\r\nCreator Comment\r\n====================\r\n> I would say... \"This is simply a remake of cs_crackhouse...\" but this project took A LOT longer than I had anticipated. I wanted it to be as far from crackhouse as possible, when it came to physical appearance. While at the same time, I was very cautious about maintaining the original, key aspects of the map. I really do hope you all enjoy this map. It was a lot of hard work, but I'm glad it's finally finished!\r\n============\r\n\r\n**UPDATE (Nov, 24th 2014)**\r\n- Fixed custom content implimentation.\r\n- Removed broken Cube Mapping.\r\n- Used default Cube Mapping.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE (Nov, 22nd 2014)**\r\n- Changed mapname from _cs_ to _dm_ to avoid any further confusion.\r\n- Expanded buy zones to avoid not spawning in a buy zone.\r\n- Attempted HDR Cube Mapping.\r\n- Ambient Lighting raised by **10** points.\r\n\r\n**POSSIBLE FUTURE PLANS**\r\n- Bombsite Version\r\n- Hostage Rescue Version"
