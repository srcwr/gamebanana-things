I will make a v2 if there is anything I should add.\r\n\r\nI made this after the indoors version that was too small. So I made an outside lab storage.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/42927\"><img src=\"http://image.fpsbanana.com/ss/maps/thm_89977.jpg\"><br>gg_lab_test</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry about bad screens. I also could not get a video because my fraps is broken, so sorry about that.\r\n\r\nI recommend not too much. 34 is the max but around 20 would be the best for game play."
