One is called \"WITH BUYZONE\" and one is called \"WITH RIFLES\".\r\n\r\n\r\n**** IMPORTANT ****\r\n\r\nIn the \"WITH BUYZONE\" folder is the map AIM_CHURCHES_X_BZ\r\nThis version of the map has NO WEAPONS (except HE's) on the map. ONLY a buyzone for each team.\r\n\r\nIn the \"WITH RIFLES\" folder is the map AIM_CHURCHES_X_WP\r\nThis version of the map has RIFLES all over - M4A1 for CT and AK47 for T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**** NOTES ****\r\n\r\nI know this map still isn't perfect. It could use displacements and a 3d skybox. I know. And I still don't care to add those.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to make any of my other GUNGAME MAPS into an FY or AIM map, please PM me and tell me. If no one does, then I won't convert those. It only takes about 30 minutes to convert, though. So let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJeremy \"Air\" Hurley"
