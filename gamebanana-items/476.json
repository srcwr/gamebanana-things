	"_sText": "My idea for a winter type map, but I got further into Zombie mod so I didn't feel like continuing with it. This MiP includes the following:\r\n\r\nHDR ready\r\nSnow\r\nCubemaps\r\n3D Skybox already made\r\n\r\nI already added settings to the Env_Sun and Light_enviroment which I think make the map look good.\r\n\r\nYou can easily change around spawnpoint, geometry, and settings if you want.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, do what want with this one, I'd look at improving my displacements though, seeing as it was my first time using them =o"
