The Two teams start on opposite sides of the map.. and generally meet in hallways.\r\nThere is no real advantage for either team.\r\n12 players per team max.\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever map created after playing around in Hammer editor so some comments would be good.. preferably nice ones. Haha.\r\n\r\nFile size - 484kb (includes .NAV file)"
