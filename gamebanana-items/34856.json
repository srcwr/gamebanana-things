	"_sText": "Counter-Strike: Source : Bot's Navigation Mesh for the map CS_ORILLA_HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nNav Creator: Meurglis3, Release Date: October 14 2014\r\n\r\nHere is the Navigation Mesh for nice assault-themed map [cs_orilla_house](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/167942) by NILIX (released August 2012), which embodied all best lines of the most successful ideological predecessors, like a cs_bikini by 3D_Mike and cs_boathouse_hdr by Patzilla. This Navigation Mesh is created from scratch and manually optimized, because in original mapauthor's release was presented slightly edited and not fully playable auto-gen .nav-file.\r\n\r\nThe bots use all possible ways and willingly look to all rooms now. Though most of all they like to swim in the pool... especially with a lifebuoy  :D\r\n\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Named.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the map author's .nav-file available to downloading with the [original map archive](http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/167942).\r\n\r\nPlay and Enjoy! All your responses and remarks are always welcomed ;-)\r\n\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\n   NILIX (for his nice sunny atmospheric assault-themed map)\r\n\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\n   BarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Chizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\n   CoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\n   Valve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).\r\n\r\nThis World Is Yours... but whose corpse float there in the pool? :-)"
