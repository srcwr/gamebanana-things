It's a completely hand-made and carefully optimized .nav-file (because in original author's release the .nav-file probably was simple auto-gen).<br><br>\r\nThis Navigation Mesh was created from scratch approximately for 60% and the most part of the areas was recustomized manually because in auto-generated Navigation Mesh some pathways and areas were constructed incorrectly (including most of stairways) or were missed (for example the path through a ventilating course).<br><br>\r\nWell... bots freely move through all walkable areas of the map now. I hope their improved behavior on this beautiful map will give you pleasure ;-)<br><br>\r\nAlso this Navigation Mesh is fully Place Painted.<br><br>\r\nNOTE: For possibility of comparison and in-game testing the original navigation file by map creator embedded in .bsp-file and available to downloading with the <a href=\"http://css.gamebanana.com/maps/137258\">same map</a>.<br><br>\r\nPlay and Enjoy! Also you aren't lazy to report about your impressions and possible remarks :-)<br><br>\r\nCredits and Gratitudes:\r\nSimon Brain (for this fascinating and modern styled map).<br><br>\r\nAdditional Gratitudes:\r\nBarnDoor (for perfect playable navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nChizbone (for informative and clever article BOT_BRAINED and a set of excellent navigation meshes),\r\nCoCoNUT (for fine hand-tuned navigation meshes for many fine CS:S maps),\r\nValve Developer Community (for learning articles by Navigation Meshes and Navigation Mesh Commands).<br><br>\r\nPlay the game... all night long! :-)<br>\r\n<br>"
