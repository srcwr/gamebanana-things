This was unfortunately cancelled due to the contest was unexpectedly shortened down. However, I think the map turned out great, and I hope you'll have lots of fun playing it. Make sure you try out the radio for some 8-Bit christmas music.\r\n\r\n<b>Story:</b>\r\n\r\nDue to the FPSB admins threatening to shut down the website for updates, some of the users went berserk and decided to take them hostage to make sure that never happened. As we all know, once FPSB is offline, all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\n<b>Thanks to:</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=http://bit.shifter.net/>Bit Shifter for their awesome \"Let It Snow\" tune.</a>\r\n(Can be played on the stereo system upstairs.)\r\n\r\nMoroes for his awesome tree models.\r\nMrkit4423 for his X-Mas props.\r\nAurora for the pooltable prefab.\r\nKlu for helping me out with soundscapes.\r\n\r\nIf you like this map, make sure to put me on your watchlist."
