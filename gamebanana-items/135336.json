	"_sText": "This is a simple small Ice Gun Game Map. The Gameplay is very fast and funny. All Sectors are identic symetric, its better for the fair Gameplay. The middle Icefield is destructable, it opens a hide underwater Way to the enemis Base, but you can go from your own Base into this underwater Way. I hope you have Fun. If some Body do this Map on his Server, plz tell me this, i like to play my Map online with other People."
