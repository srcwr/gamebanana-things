(idk pls)).<br><br><h2>Features:</h2>- Green button that resets everything.<br>- Weapons have 10000 ammo capacity.<br>- A lot of weapons on the ground.<br>- Deagles, AKs, and AWPs are the weapons on the ground.<br><br><h2>Notes:</h2>The distance from the spawn to the ddoors are about right and the spacing is also about right.<br>Im saying that because im not entirely sure about them, but the distance, im fairly 90% sure.<br><br>The height of T Spawn is the thing im not sure of, but i hope you can tell me if it is.<br><br><h1><span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>I would appreciate feedback!</b></span></h1>"
