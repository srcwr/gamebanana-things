	"_sText": "This map is a remake of de_dust for CS:S, made by 3 mappers of the carpe diem mapping team : wofa2tens, Ice-Man, and Me. \r\nWhy another dust map Sequel ? Mainly to improve its gameplay, by providing terrorists new ways to reach bomb sites, and giving them opportunities to attack their foes from behind if they are camping at their favorite places.\r\nEven if CTs are strong, they will no more have the map advantage, and they will have to move kickly (new corridors will allow them to move faster from one bomb site to another) to stop their opponents and defuse the bomb.\r\n\r\nBut improving the gameplay has not been our only goal while doing this map : We have worked a lot on the consistency with the classical \"dust look\", the overall design, the indoor/outdoors sound effects, the lighting issues and of course the map performance optimization.\r\n\r\nThere are 64 spawns to allow it for biggest CSS servers, but we have only tested the map performances with 25 players...   \r\n   \r\nYou can see more preview pictures and and an overview on <a href=\"http://www.cdiem.fr/maps/de_dust_cd\"> This site</a>"
