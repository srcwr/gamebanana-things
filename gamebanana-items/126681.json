Called Hosties_Nature\r\nIt is composed of all Hostie features, such as:\r\nGun Toss\r\nShot for Shot\r\nSee Through Wall\r\nJails\r\nPool/Jail\r\nWhite Box/Jail\r\n3 Trucks/Can be Jail\r\nand etc.\r\n\r\nI think that this is a very good accomplishment of a map for my hammer editing skills. I worked hard even though it may not be that good to others. I'm sorry, but have fun if you can."
