	"_sText": "This map is a little unorthodox for a CS map, since the hostages have been executed already. It is almost like an \"escape\" map from back in the day. The terrorists have just robbed a bank's vault, and must make their way up through either the subway or the main building to get out. This map could be considered a \"Team deathmatch\" as the only way I could find to win was to eliminate the opposing team. As for the layout, the counter-terrorists start on ground level in a park. The terrorists start in the vault of the bank. From the vault they can either escape through the bank or navigate through the sewer/railway system. Both escapes are tight and a good CT team can contain the terrorists from escaping. In the bank portion of the map, you will find the 4 hostages, except they are dead as I mention before. The bank has a cashier dest and a wall behind it that make great cover. There are cubicles on each side of the walls. Windows give any CT sniper a good view into the bank. The map came with no nav file, and my computer took 9 minutes to make one (which is a really long amount of time) so I provided it in the zip.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: yellow; font-size: xx-Small\">Review by Milkman.</p>"
