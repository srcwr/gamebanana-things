The start from the tunnel is a swimming pool, for this i used the prefab below.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/1061>Click for link</A>\r\n\r\nI also wanted a good looking surface with some nice bunkers. I was looking on google for a idea and started mapping, i just didnt get the bunker that was in my head. So i started looking on prefabs again and found this prefab.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=http://www.fpsbanana.com/prefabs/584>Click for link</A>\r\n\r\nI edited it a little bit and everything was starting to look nice.
