Get one point for each kill. \r\nThere's a timer wich counts to 60 (1 minute...) and after that everyone's that. so: no stupid campers\r\nor stuff. They won't survive. \r\nI hope it's going to be succesfull, have fun!\r\n\r\nIvar van Wooning\r\nIngame: i3D.!\\/4R\r\n\r\n\r\n(note/tip: You spawn with 1 HP, a Flashbang or Smokegrenade does 1 Damage and can so kill you in one trow.)\r\n\r\n(note/tip: You can add bots ingame with the bot_add_ct or bot_add_t command. Then you have funny, but easy enemy.)"
