	"_sText": "     This is my second major map final release to the public.  I have made many more, though this is the one that owned up to my level of standard for an official release.  cs_symphony has been in development for 10 months.  It was started after the success of my first major map release, cs_kismayo and de_kismayo.\r\n\r\n     cs_symphony is a smaller map than cs_kismayo, but still has the same level of detail and finely tuned gameplay that you would expect.  It is loosely modeled after the music building on Capital University's campus in Columbus Ohio.\r\n\r\n     HDR was not added to this map because it acted glitchy when applied.  The map really looks great without it anyway.  Placenames are included.\r\n\r\n     Please enjoy the map.  If you have any comments or concerns of any kind, feel free to email me at jazzbassking@hotmail.com or im me on AIM, sn: OreoCookieSP.\r\n\r\n     Have Fun,\r\n     Oreo"
