	"_sText": "bhop_snowy\r\n====================\r\nMade this over the last three days to challenge myself and see if I could make a fun bhop map. You tell me if I succeeded. I wanted to use a theme that isn't one of the 3 bhop themes I see in 75% of maps recently released (flat textures, dev with wavy glass, and concrete with marble bhops.) I gave it a warm/cool contrast from stage to stage and maximized visibility/sight readability.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what makes a good bhop map, so I just tried to make it consistent and open, scaling in difficulty (although it's quite easy) with no fancy or risky gameplay elements.\r\n\r\nDesigned for 100t, aa 1000-2000, tested with autohop, but I beat it on 66t so I assume scrolling on 100t is possible.\r\n\r\nTesters:\r\n- frank\r\n- Koto\r\n\r\nThanks to Komaokc for the skybox, and ToppHATTWaffle and Silkroad for textures.\r\n\r\nsurf_snowy coming soon\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
