	"_sText": "I felt one day that i should make something that isn't deathrun, fun, small hostage rescues or surf. So my mate dared me to make a very realistic bomb defusal map. I took on the dare, and have worked on this map for nearly 2days. Only one way into A, same with B, but their are points you can see into B from, unlike A, which is just one door. Main hallway, side ways and camping spots have been added. This is not the final edition, as a few things will probably need to be edited, and some things added/expanded.\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes be on the server:\r\n\r\nben.kicks-ass.org:27015\r\n\r\nadd it into favourites.\r\n\r\n"
