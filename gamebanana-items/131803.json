	"_sText": "This was once part of a map I made a few years ago (zm_fail_inc) that had to be cut out because it ended up being too large. It was slightly extended with an outdoors trainstation-like area, but was left unfinished due to lack of interest. With permission, Tony the Tiger took the time to optimize and finish off what was left to be done.\r\n\r\n**v1_1 -> v1_2**\r\n\r\n\"Balanced the Money Crate spot with 2 new entries. Should still be fairly easy to hold that spot, though. Fixed some minor visual glitches, adjusted some spots (cade items) and so forth. Basically just an update for balancing issues.\""
